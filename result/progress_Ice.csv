Dann geht es los zu dem M-Pack SVT7 und zwar haben wir einen Mute ganz wichtig wenn man das Instrument wechseln will dann einen Kompressor den man dazuschalten kann indem man einfach nur dran dreht dann fängt er automatisch an zu arbeiten. die leisenden Zöne lauter und die lauten Zöne leiser werden, damit man kompakteren Sound bekommt. Dann hat man hier noch ein Pad für extrem outputstärke Besse. Das macht minus 15 Dezibel. Dann hier einen Gain zum Einpfägeln vom Instrument. Ultra High bringt noch mal Höhen dazu und Ultra Low nochmal sehr tiefe Besse. Dann hier ein Bass Schalt Regler. einen Mittendregler, wo man hier die Frequenz aussuchen kann. Da geht es im Prinzip von tiefbasisch zu hochbasisch und dann einen Höhenregler, einen Effektmix. Wenn man einem amp eine Effektschleife macht, die man ja hinten einschleifen kann, kann man hier mit den Effektanteil regeln, der dann im Endeffekt im Sound auftaucht. Und hier ist der Master für die Lautstärke und hier Phones für Kopie. hinten haben wir nochmal die i out, weil man mit dem verstärker direkt in die PA rein will. so dann zeige ich euch jetzt alle erstes mal den kompressor ich mache den jetzt mal so auf die hälfte dann zeige ich euch am besten den ultra high und ultra low gleichzeitig das ist ziemlich gut ziemlich genial wenn man so slap und funky geschichten machen will Dann den Bassregler. Einfach mal zum hören, in welchem Wirkungsgrad die Bessel hier zuschlagen. Drehe ich mal so ein Viertel auf. Einmal ein Viertel zurück. Dann zeige ich euch mal schnell wie die ganzen Mittenfrequenzen greifen. Dafür drehe ich die mitten mal voll auf und zeige erst mal die Frequenz 1. Dann die Frequenz 2, also es wird im Prinzip von tief zu hoch. Dann die Frequenz 4 und zum Schluss die Frequenz 5. und als letztes nochmal den Höhenregler aufgedreht zurückgedreht. Okay, das war es von mir und dem SVT-7. Wenn ihr das Teil anchecken wollt, kommt bei uns im Ladengeschäft vorbei oder checkt es aus auf www.zechen.de. Wenn ihr es euch bestellen wollt, könnt ihr gar nichts falsch machen, weil ihr habt 33 Tage Moneyback-Garantie und 66 Tage Umtage reicht. Das war es von mir und bis zum nächsten Mal.","Hi, this is Max from Zechen Music and I'm showing you the M-Pack SVT-7 Pro. So, let's start with the M-Pack SVT-7. We have a mute, which is very important when we want to change the instrument. Then we have a compressor, which we can switch on, where we just turn it on. Then the compressor automatically starts working. The compressor is the one that the lower tones are louder and the louder tones are quieter so you get a more compact sound. Then we have a pad for extreme output, which is better. It makes minus 15 dB. Then a gain for the input of the instrument. Ultra high brings higher and ultra low for a lower bass. A mid-ranger where you can choose the frequency, which is basically from low to high bass. And then a high-ranger, an effect mix. If you make an effect loop on the amp, which you can input back here, you can use the effect part rules, which then in the end also appears in the sound. And here is the master for the volume and here for the copper. At the back we have a DI out, because you want to put the amplifier directly into the PA. So, then I'll show you the compressor first. I'll put it on half of the amp. Then I'll show you the Ultra High and Ultra Low at the same time. That's pretty good, pretty great if you want to make slaps and funky stories. Then the bass knob. Just to hear the effect of the bass, I turn it on. And back to the middle. Then I'll show you how to play the mid frequencies. I turn the mids on and show you the frequency 1. then the frequency 2, so it's basically too high then the frequency 4 and finally the frequency 5 and now the high note That's it from me and SVT7. If you want to check it out, visit our store or check it out at www.sechen.de. If you want to order it, you can't do anything wrong because you have 33 days of money back guarantee and 66 days of exchange. That's it from me and see you next time."

So this is actually the difference of two perfect squares. So if we're really careful, we should be able to factor this. Let's try. So I'm gonna make these really big parentheses just to impress you. So I'm gonna have, well, the first term plus the second term, and then I have first term minus the second term. Do you see it's just the difference of two perfect squares, but the squares themselves are complicated. But so what? Work it out. This times that equals that squared. Inside term is the exact same thing as the outside term, but they cancel because they differ by a negative sign. The last two terms give me this. But now we can actually simplify this a little bit. Let's see what happens. Here I have an x plus an x. That sounds like 2x to me. And here I see a y minus a y. That sounds like zero. So that's pretty cool. And what do we have here? Well, here I see an x minus an x. So that looks like zero. And then I see a y and a minus y. That also seems like zero. So this looks like I should put a zero here and zero times anything is zero. This whole thing turns out to be zero. Except for a big, big mistake. In fact, this is on my top 10 list. In fact, I think it's number four of my classic mistakes. And that is the subtracting mistake. Right? Share the negativity. Share the negativity. What you've got to do is distribute that negative sign everywhere. I didn't do that when I talked through the problem. So let me do it a little bit slower now. I have an x minus an x. That still is zero. But now I have a y minus a minus y. Minus a minus is a plus. So I actually see y plus y. And that gives me a 2y. Classic mistake there. Hope you make it now and never again. This would be 4xy. So this thing can be factored quite nicely into actually three little teeny things. Four, X, Y. Neat. Okay, how about one last one just for the road? Give me one for my baby and one more for the road. Did you watch the last episode of the night show with Johnny Carson? That's, well, the second to the last one. Bet Midler sang that song. It was very sad. I was in tears. Okay, here's a quartic. Has a power four there. It's looking like a power problem, but I'll give you a chance to do it first. And my only hint there is Don't panic. See if you can sort of pull it out. OK. Well, the trick is to see that you have an x squared here and an x squared squared here. So if you'd like one way to think about this is to maybe just replace the x squared by something else. I don't know if you like this or not. In fact, I sort of wonder. Some people like it. Some don't. In fact, let me do it for you both ways really fast. This is a good idea. That way everybody's happy. You want to make everyone happy. I want to make you happy. But I want to make everyone else happy. So what would I do here? The first thing, I'll put parentheses around that, is to see, okay, I've got something squared minus 3, something minus 4. And so what do I do? I'll factor it, I'll put the copy of something here and a copy of something here. And you've got to be a little bit careful because you'll notice that that product does give me that something squared. And then I see a negative sign that means I'm going to have either a plus or a minus or a minus or a plus. But since these are the same, it doesn't make a difference how I place these. I'll put a plus and a minus here. It doesn't make a difference how I place these. difference to the same. And I need something to put in here that multiplies to give 4, but that combines in a very nice way to give 3. Now I'm going to talk you through how I'm thinking about this. These differ by 1, so I think a 4 and a 1 are going to work, because if I take 4 and subtract 1, I'll sort of get a 3 there. Where should the 4 go? The 4 should be on the bigger, the 4 should dominate because I want it to be negative, so I'm going to put the 4 on the negative part. That's how I think about it. Let me recap. A 2 and a 2 actually wouldn't work out too well because then I get cancellation and stuff. So a 4 and a 1 looks good because they can combine to give three. Since I want it to be negative, I'm going to put the big value on the negative side. So that's my thinking. Anyway, you might have a lot of different thinking and probably clearer thinking, but this actually does work. So there's the factorization, fine. And that's one way to proceed. Another way to proceed is the following. Let me do this on some special paper here. Another way to proceed is to go back to this line and just take those terms if they scare you, if they bother you, and just call them something else. Maybe just call it A. So maybe just let, you know, So A, ooh, my yellow is dying. Let's let A be x squared. If you let A be x squared, then you can just rewrite this out and say, OK, then we have A squared minus 3A minus 4. You see how I'm just getting rid of all that squared things if it bothered you to work with it? And now you could just factor this as you would anything else. I put an A and an A. and then a minus plus, and then I put the 4 and the 1. But I'm not done yet. I'm not done until I replace the a's by the x squared. So now I've got to insert for a x squared, and insert for a x squared, and then I get exactly this. Do you see how that's exactly this when I insert that in? So that's another way of doing it. If you sort of don't like dealing with that because you're afraid you might sort of drop an x bone, it may just put an x here by mistake. A great mistake would just be to put x's there. If you think that might happen to you, be really careful and maybe make a little substitution and get rid of that problem. But then when you get your final answer, remember it's just the penultimate answer, the actual final answer requires you to plug back the x-squareds in there and then you get this. Now, one last point is that maybe this is not the answer you got. Because in fact, this can be factored even more. Notice this is the difference of two perfect squares. So let's not stop there. Now sadly, of course, this is the sum of two perfect squares. No enchilada. But that second term is the difference of two perfect squares, x plus 2x minus 2x. minus 2. And now I factor that completely. So in fact, there is the complete factorization of this quartic. It has these three factors, none of which can be factored anymore. Phew. Anyway, there's a hodge-podge of factoring. And I hope you had fun. I don't think it's that fun.","Okay, the thing to notice here is that even though you're tempted, I mean there's such a great temptation to work all this out and have things cancel, you might notice that this is something squared, it's some like blop squared, and then some other blop squared.

And that is the subtracting mistake. Right? Share the negativity. Share the negativity. What you've got to do is distribute that negative sign everywhere. I didn't do that when I talked through the problem. So let me do it a little bit slower now. I have an x minus an x. That still is zero. But now I have a y minus a minus y. Minus a minus is a plus. So I actually see y plus y. And that gives me a 2y. Classic mistake there. Hope you make it now and never again. This would be 4xy. So this thing can be factored quite nicely into actually three little teeny things. Four, X, Y. Neat. Okay, how about one last one just for the road? Give me one for my baby and one more for the road. Did you watch the last episode of the night show with Johnny Carson? That's, well, the second to the last one. Bet Midler sang that song. It was very sad. I was in tears. Okay, here's a quartic. Has a power four there. It's looking like a power problem, but I'll give you a chance to do it first. And my only hint there is Don't panic. See if you can sort of pull it out. OK. Well, the trick is to see that you have an x squared here and an x squared squared here. So if you'd like one way to think about this is to maybe just replace the x squared by something else. I don't know if you like this or not. In fact, I sort of wonder. Some people like it. Some don't. In fact, let me do it for you both ways really fast. This is a good idea. That way everybody's happy. You want to make everyone happy. I want to make you happy. But I want to make everyone else happy. So what would I do here? The first thing, I'll put parentheses around that, is to see, okay, I've got something squared minus 3 something minus 4. And so what do I do? I'll factor it, I'll put the copy of something here and a copy of something here, and you've got to be a little bit careful because you'll notice that that product does give me that something squared. And then I see a negative sign that means I'm going to have either a plus or a minus or a minus or a plus, but since these are the same, it doesn't make a difference how I place these. I'll put a plus and a minus so you doesn't make a difference. the difference to the same. And I need something to put in here that multiplies to give 4, but that combines in a very nice way to give 3. Now I'm going to talk you through how I'm thinking about this. These differ by 1, so I think a 4 and a 1 are going to work because if I take 4 and subtract 1, I'll sort of get a 3 there. Where should the 4 go? The 4 should be on the bigger, the 4 should dominate because I want it to be negative, so I'm going to put the 4 on the negative part. That's how I think about it. Let me recap. A 2 and a 2 actually wouldn't work out too well because then I get cancellation and stuff. So a 4 and a 1 looks good because they can combine to give three. Since I want it to be negative, I'm going to put the big value on the negative side. So that's my thinking. Anyway, you might have a lot of different thinking and probably clearer thinking, but this actually does work. So there's the factorization, fine. And that's one way to proceed. Another way to proceed is the following. Let me do this on some special paper here. Another way to proceed is to go back to this line and just take those terms if they scare you, if they bother you, and just call them something else. Maybe just call it A. So maybe just let, you know, So A, ooh, my yellow is dying. Let's let A be x squared. If you let A be x squared, then you can just rewrite this out and say, OK, then we have A squared minus 3A minus 4. You see how I'm just getting rid of all that squared things if it bothered you to work with it? And now you could just factor this as you would anything else. I put an A and an A. and then a minus plus, and then I put the 4 and the 1. But I'm not done yet. I'm not done until I replace the a's by the x squareds. So now I've got to insert for a x squared, and insert for a x squared, and then I get exactly this. Do you see how that's exactly this when I insert that in? So that's another way of doing it. If you sort of don't like dealing with that because you're afraid you might sort of drop an x-bone, it may just put an x here by mistake. A great mistake would just be to put x's there. If you think that might happen to you, be really careful and maybe make a little substitution and get rid of that problem, but then when you get your final answer, remember it's just the penultimate answer, the actual final answer requires you to plug back the x-squareds in there and then you get this. Now, one last point is that maybe this is not the answer you got, because in fact this can be factored even more. Notice this is the difference of two perfect squares. So let's not stop there. Now sadly, of course, this is the sum of two perfect squares, no enchilada. But that second term is the difference of two perfect squares, x plus two x minus two. minus 2. And now I factor that completely. So in fact, there is the complete factorization of this quartic. It has these three factors, none of which can be factored anymore. Phew. Anyway, there's a hodge-podge of factoring. And I hope you had fun. I don't think it's that fun."

De var noen i sesjonen, og de jobbde med rett. Det var enig, og de var sværtablet med en masse små blomster. De blomste, og det var en stor nampe på som som var på sunen, som de kjære funnet. Det er som å legge dette, og det er jo altså koppentrits personer. Det er ikke mange som har en liv. Og så er det noen få i fan til livet, men det er veldig mange. Og at de finne det til personen, så blir de om til somoppet og så setter somoppet. Det var utrolig klottbillet. Det er tøft å se på. Vi sier at blomstene som en fulva er i grav, og vi er link på en gravseppratt. Og det er kun familien legger midden på denne personen, i denne graven. Og som hun sa at en person er ikke bort å slenge familien, husker bare når du døde det først, og har alle glemmer det. Ja, da du var på en måte av bordet. Ja, jeg kan tykke at de ble glemme.","Down in the house we were sleeping in San Carlos, there was a house where the paramilitary had two quarters, while they were working in the far north. We were there and many stories about what was going on there. It was all from the worst of the tour to the wolves and a lot of stuff in the back. And the lady who was similar to her had experienced the worst. And she was hit by a gun when she was 5 years old. But instead of reacting with violence, she chose to turn the other side and even meet those who had a gun. But she doesn't do anything about it. They are all in the group now. They have an organization where they work with this. And they actually worked with the black table. With a lot of small flowers. And the flowers are big names for the person who was in the group. They are happy that it's their head, not theirs. There are not many people in life. She said there were some people in life, but there were not many. And when they found the person, they called them the summer flowers. And they said summer flowers. And that was incredible."

Se descargaría, ahora lo veremos, pero lo que os quiero enseñar es que esta parte de aquí abajo que pone más información, la podemos deslizar hacia arriba y se nos abrirá aquí una lista desplegable con información acerca del zip que estamos a punto de descargar. Como es, por ejemplo, el nombre del zip, el nombre de la lista, la lista de la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista, la lista de la lista y el nombre real del cip, la versión y la descripción. Por ejemplo, vamos a descargarnos un modem como puede ser el jbt. Vamos aquí modem jbt, le damos a descargar. Como vemos ya está aquí descargando el modem jbt y nos vamos a la pestaña de instalar. Aquí nos aparecerán los nombres de los cips que tengamos descargados. Se va descargando, paso a enseñaros un poquito apartado de configuración. No le hagáis muchos casos a los que hay en ajustes ya que la mayoría no serán demasiado útiles, la compatibilidad con el Gormor 5 ya está arreglada de serie, que en vez de la carpeta de descarga no os recomiendo que lo hagáis, porque aparte de no estar todo seguro de si funciona ya que me dio muchos problemas a la hora de portarlo, es posible que después no os deje instalar correctamente y la parte de buscar actualizaciones pues simplemente entrando de vez en cuando ya lo podría solucionar. Eso está orientado más a nivel de Errons que sacan compilaciones cada, por ejemplo, cada semana. Entonces pues sí que es muy interesante tenerlo, pero para nosotros no. Y al final de todo pues, podríais dedicar un minuto de vuestra vida, leerlo, es lo que pone al final de la aplicación. Que lo he enseñado aquí pues para que tengáis que instalarla y leerlo vosotros mismos. Me volvemos y está aquí descargado, ya usó Updater y tenemos aquí el modem.jvt. Entonces vemos aquí dos botones de añadir y eliminar y que el botón de aquí abajo ha cambiado. por aplicar pues aquí tenemos la cola de instalación vamos a poner por ejemplo el modo mjbt y añadir aparentemente no ha pasado nada pero si le hacemos hacia arriba vemos aquí que tenemos el modo mjbt y se añadiremos por ejemplo el dpi 9r2 vosotros no veréis el dpi de la 9r2 porque no directamente nos va a parecer yo esto lo tengo aquí por pruebas pero así lo enseño bueno vamos a descargarlo por ejemplo vamos a descargar el dpi a 240, como ves es para la R10. Vamos a descargarlo también, con un poco muy poquito. Es posible que en ocasiones tarde tres, cuatro segundos en iniciar la descarga, no os estréséis, no os sobre saturéis la aplicación. Aparte de decir que esta es la primera versión pública, es decir, si falla no os sorprendáis. Pues ya lo tenemos aquí descargado, vamos a instalar, como vemos ya nos aparece 240 de PI R10 y añadir. Tenemos aquí los dos tips que hemos agregado a la cola y podemos subir y bajar su orden, simplemente con las flechitas de aquí, subir y bajar. O eliminarlos de la cola, simplemente dando la X. Me acabo de dar cuenta de un fallo que es... No, no falla. No he dicho nada. Y tenemos dos opciones que son hacer WebData, por si alguien quisiera hacerlo desde aquí, o hacer un Android Backup. El Android Backup es posible que en ocasiones no lo restaure correctamente si después la hora de restaurarlo hay veces que si hay veces que no la verdad no es una función que creo que muchos de nosotros utilicemos y si la utilizamos lo hacemos directamente desde recovery y el web data pues por si alguien quiere hacerlo desde aquí intenté implementar webcache webdalvic pero eso es mejor integrarlo directamente desde el zip así que por mi parte yo os recomendaría que estas dos opciones las tengáis prácticamente siempre desmarcadas entonces simplemente como vemos ya tenemos la col espero que os haya gustado el vídeo, que os guste la aplicación, si falla lo siento y pues nada, un saludo, a disfrutar la aplicación y hasta el próximo vídeo.","Hello, this is a video from Xafri and today we are going to do a review of the new ROM, which will be released soon. We are going to see the new application, the new update, which will be incorporated into the ROMs of the new ROM. It is an update based on the JAWS Updater created by Arastel and I have downloaded it to Samsung Galaxy S so that we can enjoy it. First of all, install the app, which I suppose you have already done in this video, and the next thing is to open it. We find an interface that has 4 tabs, changeable from here. The ADD-Pi tab, the Modems tab and the tab to install. The ADD tab contains the added ones for the ROM, such as the Google Apps or some zip that we will consider that I have recommended flashing. The second is the DPI, as its own name indicates, you will find there to download the DPI tips. The following are the Modems, you will find all the variety of Modems that I have so far. And the fourth is the Pestanias installed, where we can install any of the files that we have downloaded from the other three Pestanias. It is worth saying that from now on you will only see the files available for your application. If you have the R10 and go to the DPI section, you will not see the changes for the 9R, 9R2, etc. You will only see the tips for your ROM. After this, we have three buttons below, which are to update the configuration download. Just a push above them, we will get a little notification with its function. We have to restore the extras, because the previous one will be removed and the GAPs package will be removed by clicking and clicking the download button. This bar below will add more information, we can slide it up and we will see a list of the links to download the zip. We can see the real name of the zip, the version and the description. For example, we are going to download a mod, as can be the JVT. We see here the JVT mod, we give it to download. As we see here, downloading the JVT mod and we go to the tab to install, here we will see the names of the zip that we have downloaded. It is downloading, I show you a little bit of configuration. Do not read many cases to the The most of the settings are not very useful, the compatibility with the GW5 is already fixed. The discard card is not recommended because it does not work. I had many problems when I was carrying it. It is possible that later I will not install it correctly. And the update section is just coming in from time to time when I could solve it. and make mistakes that make up every week. So it's interesting to have it, but not for us. And at the end of everything, you could dedicate a minute of your life to read what the application says at the end, which I showed here so you have to install it and read it yourself. We move and it's downloaded here, I use Updater and we have here the Modem.jobt. So we see here two buttons to add and delete, and the button down here has changed. We have the two tips that we have added to the queue and we can go up and down, simply with the arrows here, go up and down or delete them from the queue simply by giving it the X that I just realized a fail that is ... oh no, it does not fail, I have not said anything and we have two options that are to do Wipe Data, if someone wants to do it from here or to do a NANDROID BACKUP It is possible that we do not restore it correctly and then restore it. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It is a function that I think many of us use and if we use it, we do it directly from recovery. And the web data, in case someone wants to do it from here, I tried to implement webcache and webdalvic, but that is better to integrate it directly from the zip. So, for my part, I would recommend that these two options are practically always unmarked. So, simply, since we already have the call, I hope you liked the video, that you like the application, if you fail I'm sorry and well, a greeting, enjoy the application and until the next video"

Bonjour Jean-François Guérot. Bonjour. Merci de passer par Journal de TV 5 Monde. Vous publiez chez Odile Jacob la grande fraude, crime, subprimes et crise financière. Quelle est pour vous la preuve la plus flagrante pour démontrer que cette crise est en fait au départ un crime ? La preuve vient des États-Unis elle-même. En mai 2009, le président Obama, dans une vieille tradition américaine, a demandé ce qu'il y ait une grande commission d'enquête qui soit instaurée pour essayer de comprendre qu'elle était l'origine de la crise. Et au tout début de cette loi instituant donc une grande commission d'enquête, la FCIC, le premier but qui était demandé aux parlementaires, c'était de trouver les causes frauduleuses de cette crise. Donc les Américains eux-mêmes, du moins les démocrates, ont bien analysé dès le départ que le principe moteur de la crise était bien un moteur criminel. Vous êtes commissaire-divisionnaire, un petit peu particulier, puisque vous êtes docteur en droit, diplomé de sens politique, et l'institut de criminologie de Paris également. Pour vous, il y a eu un déclencheur qui a été occulté par rapport à cette crise des surprimes et vous le datez au niveau des années 80 avec la faillite des caisses des parmi-américaines. Pourquoi ? Alors d'abord, je crois qu'il faut sortir des explications conformistes, habituelles, paresseuses, voire un peu naïfes, qui consistent à nous dire qu'en définitive toutes ces crises financières, elles sont inéluctables, ce sont des catastrophes naturelles, c'est la théorie des cycles, etc. Non, en réalité, toutes les crises financières ont une dimension criminelle. Et si on veut bien comprendre cette dimension de criminelle de la crise des subprimes qui est devenue une crise mondiale, il faut remonter, il faut un petit peu en arrière, il faut faire un peu d'histoire. Et en effet, déjà dans les années 80 en St-Uni, on a eu une grande crise financière que tout le monde a oublié voire occulté, qui est la faillite des cases d'épargne, les saving on loans. Or, l'osculation de cette première grande crise financière criminelle, eh bien, nous démontre qu'il y avait fraude en masse de manière absolument gigantesque, à la fois systémique et systématique. Et sur les décombres de ces caisses d'épargne, de cette faillite gigantesque, et bien ensuite, c'est réorganisé tout le système financier américain autour du cadre de la titrisation qui a conduit à l'affaire de subprime. Vous savez, comme le dit Shakespeare dans la tempête, « pastis prologue » tout à une origine. Il y a des termes qui font froid dans le dos et on comprend d'ailleurs que du coup tous les patrons de la finance connaissaient les les produits qu'il proposait, ces produits toxiques, par exemple, il y a les prêts à neutrons. Expliquez-nous ce que c'est qu'un prêt à neutrons. Alors, l'origine de la crise, c'est quoi ? C'est la bulle immobilière, les prêts hypothécaires. Donc entre les financiers, tous ces prêts hypothécaires, ils appelaient des prémenteurs ou des prêts prédateurs, où ils appelaient encore les prêts à neutrons. Alors, la notion de prêts à neutrons n'est pas une notion juridique, mais vous comprenez bien qu'elle est absolument ignoble, puisque l'arme à neutrons, c'est une arme qui détruit les personnes, mais qui laisse un tacte les bâtiments. Donc les prêteurs américains, les banques américaines qui distribuent ces prêts, qu'on va un petit peu détailler si vous voulez, savaient très bien que les prêts de toute façon allaient tuer les ménages, mais qu'ensuite ils pourraient récupérer les maisons. Quand ils parlent de prêts prédateurs et de prémenteurs, ils savent très bien qu'ils distribuent des prêts dont les gens, que les gens seront à jamais incapables de rembourser. On prêtaient à qui ? En toute conscience. En réalité, on prêtaient aux plus vulnérables, la société américaine. Les minorités ethniques, les Noirs, les Hispaniques, les pauvres, les vieux, les handicapés. On leur faisait signer des contrats de prêt en commettant tout un tas d'infraction pénale, à but de confiance et ce qu'on crie, à but de faiblesse, des faux, etc. On leur accordait ces prêts non pas en fonction de leur capacité de remboursement, mais en fonction du prix de la maison, un prix qui avait été évalué de manière frauduleuse. Donc on savait très bien qu'on allait les étranger. Voilà. Donc on a créé une vaste bulle immobilière, mais cette bulle immobilière, cette bulle de prix inflationniste, ce sont des prix truqués à l'église. la base. Voilà. Et il faut comprendre que cette bulle immobilière s'est créée à partir de centaines de milliers de prêts qui étaient en grande partie frauduleux. Les prêts subprimes étaient très souvent des prémenteurs, des prêts prédateurs et des prêts frauduleux. Mais les frauds ne se sont pas limités en amont. Si vous voulez la formation de la bulle immobilière, vous avez vu d'autres frauds tout le long de la chaîne financière au niveau des agences de notation et ensuite au niveau de Wall Street puisque tous ces prêts, ça a été leur particularité par la titrisation, ont été revendus sur les marchés. Et comprenez bien que les grandes banques d'investissement ne disaient pas que l'était la réalité extrêmement douteuse de ces prêts qu'ils connaissaient. Parlez-nous de cette titrisation s'il vous plaît. Vous pouvez vous la décortiquer pour nous faire comprendre justement la notion de crime. Alors, la titrisation n'est pas en soi un processus frauduleux. C'est un processus financier qui existe depuis les années 80 et qui existe encore aujourd'hui. Mais toute la ruse du phénomène des subprimes a consisté une fois que les prêts ont été accordés, à les sortir des bilans des banques, à les transformer en titres financiers pour être revendu sur les marchés financiers. C'est ça, la titrisation. Donc, à partir du moment où les banques pouvaient tout de suite se débarrasser en réalité de ces prêts, il n'avait aucun intérêt à ce que les prêts, lorsqu'ils les accordaient, soient des prêts, j'allais dire, conformes, raisonnables. Puisqu'ils reportaient la responsabilité de ces prêts sur un autre acteur financier, c'est ce qu'on appelle l'allée amoral chez les économistes, et bien évidemment, ils avaient intérêt à distribuer des prêts de manière quantitative et non pas de manière qualitative. Que peut faire le politique par rapport à l'économique aujourd'hui ? Est-ce que Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy ou d'autres ont les moyens de pouvoir contrebalancer quand ils ont appris des décisions ? Est-ce que réellement, il va y avoir des choses qui vont changer ? Alors, ce qu'il faut comprendre, c'est que la crise de subprime est le fruit de la dérégulation. Et la dérégulation est profondément criminogène. C'est-à-dire qu'elle crée des incitations et des opportunités à commettre des crimes. Et là, ce sont des crimes systémiques et systématiques quand elle est commis par les cols blancs, par les élites financières. Alors pourquoi y'a-t-il eu les dérégulations ? Parce qu'il y a eu des lois qui ont été votées en ce sens. Alors est-ce qu'après la crise des subprimes, les grands noirs de régulation financière, en particulier la loi d'Aude Franck, a permis de revenir en arrière ? Non, en réalité, c'est une loi purement cosmétique et superficielle. C'est-à-dire que le pouvoir politique aux États-Unis, c'est depuis longtemps déplacé en direction de Wall Street. Le pouvoir politique, grâce à l'argent des lobbys financiers et plus à Wall Street, ou au moins ils se partagent au moins autant entre Wall Street et le Congrès. C'est la même chose ici en Europe, pareil pour Paris, pareil pour l'Europe. En Europe, le système est un petit peu différent, surtout en France, parce que ce qui nous a, nous, en partie préservé en France, est que nous avons un système bancaire et financier très contrôlé, très régulé. Ce que le monde a au bout de l'eau saxon nous a beaucoup reproché pendant des décennies en nous disant, vous Français, vous êtes ringard. On est frileux. Et bien ce n'était pas de la ringardiste, pas de la frilosité, c'était de la prudence, ni plus ni moins. Il est vrai que les grands lois de régulation, en particulier ces étés udiques qui ont été votées, ne vont pas fondamentalement remettre en cause le système. Et parce que ce diagnostic frauduleux et criminels n'a pas été fait honnêtement jusqu'à présent, c'est comme un malade. Si vous lui dites qu'il a un mal de tête alors qu'il est atteint d'un cancer, il est certain de reschuter voire de mourir. Ce diagnostic criminel n'avait pas été fait après la faillie de l'Équête d'Epargne, et donc les Amériques ont reschuté avec l'affaire des surprises. Et aujourd'hui, ce que l'on peut redouter, c'est que cet analyse frauduleux du leu, ce diagnostic frauduleux n'a pas été fait totalement honnêtement dans l'affaire de subprime et donc on risque dans les décennies à venir d'avoir de nouvelles crises financières avec un contenu à la fois à nouveau extrêmement problématique. vraies causes. Sortir des explications convenues, comme je le disais, pour, à travers le choix du bon diagnostic et des bons mots, faire émerger une vérité un petit peu différente. Permettre un questionnement autre, comme disent les anglo-saxons, avoir la capacité à penser en dehors de la boîte. Jean-François Guérot, la grande fraude, séchée au dîle Jacob par le CRIP, S.P. et Crise Financière, se proverbe malinquée pour se quitter quand la fraude a construit une maison, elle l'a détruit. Merci beaucoup Jean-François. Merci.","The power has changed tomorrow. Hello Jean-François Guérot. Hello. Thank you for the newspaper TV5 Monde. You published at Odile Jacob the great fraud, crime, subprimes and financial crisis. What is the most flagrant proof for you to show that this crisis is actually a crime? Well, the proof comes from the United States itself. In May 2009, Obama, in an old American tradition, asked what a great investigation commission is to try to understand It was the origin of the crisis. At the very beginning of this law, the FCIC, the first goal that was asked by the parliamentarians, was to find the fraudulent causes of this crisis. The Americans themselves, at least the Democrats, have analyzed from the start that the principle of the crisis engine was a criminal engine. You are a divisionary commissioner, a little bit particular, because you are a doctor in law, a political diplomat, the Paris Crimes Institute as well. For you, there was a trigger that was hidden from this surprise crisis and you dated it in the 1980s with the failure of the American parliaments. Why? First, I think we should get out of the conventional conformist explanations, which are a bit naive, which consist in telling us that in the end, all these financial crises are inevitable, they are natural disasters, it is the theory of cycles, etc. In reality, all financial crises have a criminal dimension. And if we want to understand this criminal dimension of the subprime crisis, which has become a global crisis, we have to go back a little bit and we have to make a little history. And indeed, already in the 1980s in the United States, we had a big financial crisis that everyone forgot to see occult, which is the failure of the Parangal cases, the saving on loans. However, the escalation of this first big criminal financial crisis, well, it shows that there were frauds in mass, in a gigantic way, both systemic and systematic. And on the debris of these huge flaws, then it reorganized the entire American financial system around the framework of the titrification that led to the Subprime affair. As the Dichexpeer says in the Tempest, Pashtis Prologue, all has an origin. There are terms that are cold in the back and we understand that all the bosses of finance knew the What is the origin of the crisis? It is the immobility bubble, the pre-hypotheic. So between the financiers, all these pre-hypotheic, they called them pre-men, or pre-pruders, or they called them pre-neutrons. The notion of pre-neutron is not a legal notion, but you understand well that it is absolutely ignorant, because the neutral weapon is a weapon that destroys people, but that makes the building collapse. So the American bank distributes these loans, which we will detail if you want, it is well known that the loans will kill the tenants, but then they could recover the houses. When they talk about loan and loan sharks, they know that they distribute loans that people will never be able to repay. Who did they lend to? In all conscience. In fact, they lent to the most vulnerable American society. Ethnic minorities, black, Hispanic, poor, old, handicapped. They were signed contracts, as a whole a lot of a criminal fraction, a debt of trust, a debt of weakness, flaws, etc. We reminded them that these loans did not have their capacity to pay, but according to the price of the house, a price that had been evaluated in a fraudulent way. So we knew very well that we had the English. So we created a vast immobility bubble, but this immobility bubble, this inflationary price bubble, these are prices that are at risk. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high.

The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high. The price of the property was very high the big investment banks did not say that it was the extremely dubious reality of these loans that they knew. Talk to us about this titration please. You have been decorded to make us understand the notion of crime. So, titration is not either a fraudulent process, it is a financial process that exists since the 80s and that still exists today. But all the rush of the phenomenon of subprimes has consisted once the loans have been granted, it is going to take out the bills of the banks, it is going to be transformed into financial titles. to be sold on the financial markets. That's titling. So when the banks could immediately get rid of their loans, they had no interest in what the loans were when they agreed, either loans that were reasonable, because they were taking responsibility for their loans on another financial actor, which is what we call the moral approach to economists, they obviously had interest in distributing loans quantitatively and not qualitatively. What can politics do to the economy today? Can Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy or others have the means to counterbalance when they say they have made decisions? Will there really be changes? What we need to understand is that the subprime crisis is the result of deregulation. And deregulation is deeply criminogenic. It creates incitements and opportunities to commit crimes. And these are systemic and systematic crimes committed by white schools, by financial elites. Why were there regulations? Because there were laws that were voted in this sense. After the subprime crisis, the great laws of financial regulation, in particular the law of other France, allowed to return to the back. No, in reality it is a purely cosmetic and superficial law. That is to say that the political power in the United States has been moving for a long time towards Wall Street. Political power thanks to the money of the financial lobby and more to Wall Street, or at least they share less in the Wall Street and the Congress. It's the same thing here in Europe, the same for Paris, the same for London. In Europe, the system is a little different, especially in France because what we have in part preserved in France is that we have a banking system very controlled, very regulated. What the world of the Saxon work has brought us very close for decades, we are saying to ourselves, you French, you are a rungard. We are free. We are free. Well, it was not rungardism, it was not frivolity, it was prudence, not more nor less. It is true that the laws of regulation, particularly the U.S. that have been voted, will not fundamentally put the system in a position. And because this fraudulent and criminal diagnosis has not been done honestly until now, it's like a disease. If you tell him that he has a headache while he is suffering from cancer, he is certain to fall apart to die. This criminal diagnosis had not been done after the failure of the paramedics and so the Americans fell apart with the surprise affair. And today what we can suspect is that this fraudulent analysis This fraudulent diagnosis has not been done in the supply business. So we risk in the coming decades to have new financial crises with content that is, again, extremely problematic. The real cause, to get out of the convoluted explanations, as I said, to make a different reality through the choice of the right diagnosis and the right words. It allows for a different questioning, as the English said, to have the capacity to think outside the box. Thank you."

Plus, a lot of human rights organizations, I have to say that, a lot of human rights organizations, especially in Cairo, decided to support the invitation to participate in the protest. And they have a lot of social credibility and a lot of popular credibility among the people and they adopted the event. Some of them were lawyers and they told us they gave us specific instructions on how to deal with riot police and what to do if we were actually politically detained and who to call and who do we need to go to if we need to ask for help or for advice for whatever reason. And some of these organizations were actually supporting the protesters on Liberation Square by providing them with food, with blankets, with water, with some with so many things, whatever we needed. We actually managed to create a hospital on the field inside one of the mosques near to the Liberation Square where we just did the first aid for all the injured people or for all the injured protesters. So that's one thing. Plus there was one other benefit that we managed to have in the protests is that there were a lot of people from different social backgrounds, from different cultural backgrounds, We had a lot of people from the upper middle class who actually have a lot of funds and happen to be living comfortably and they decided to use their own personal funds in providing us with food, water and shelter too. They actually in the middle of Tahir Square they put up some tents where they collect videos and pictures so that we can post it online on the internet. And they actually decided to put up some more tents to do the work. first aid for injured people in addition to the the the civil hospital inside the mosque. So actually this is one thing we benefited from a lot of rich people came to support us just with the funds to use the funds and support us and this actually proves one point this was not only about unemployment and poverty this was one main cause but also a lot of people who lived comfortably and who were not exactly miserable under Mubarak regime decided to support the protests Because it's a demand for democracy. That's just one more reason to prove that this is a demand for democracy and that we are not going to stop for whatever reason. And you know the presence of some rich people who live comfortably just supported this cause. So as I said, to be honest, a lot of groups did not exactly expect this to happen in real life on the streets but it actually managed to happen. with the support of a lot of human rights organizations. And actually I will use this chance to tell you about a human rights center called Hesham Mubarak Center for Law. It's based in Cairo and it has something called the Egyptian Front to Defend Egyptian Protesters. And you will actually find their website online. They have a blog and they have like a hotline with various numbers to call them whenever you need support for the protesters if they need legal aid. They also post lists of people in detention and they also post lists of the martyrs and they also post lists of injured people so that their families know about them. Of course their work was suspended for three or four days once the internet was cut off but once it came back, you know, we continued to work. I volunteered for them by the way. And again I would say this is a secular group and they were one of the main bases for the protests on Liberation Square. And one more thing I would like to mention is that some opposition groups, or I would actually say some of the, a lot of the opposition groups were trying to take over the protests and to pretend like, you know, they sort of, they can speak for the people on Liberation Square or Tahirir Square and all the people on the streets. This is not true. They tried to do that and we always asked them to step down and not to deliver speeches because we do not want any political party to represent us. We do not stand behind political ideologies.","about online activism. We saw massive groups on the street and we started calling everyone.

Benyamin Netanyahu à Washington devant Barack Obama a expliqué qu'il était prêt à ouvrir à nouveau des négociations avec les Palestiniens. Et pourtant, à Washington, Netanyahu s'est refusé à prononcer le mot d'État palestinien qui est pourtant prévu par la feuille de route qui avait été acceptée par les précédents gouvernements israéliens. Donc on a l'impression qu'on a fait un petit peu un retour en arrière. Barack Obama lui a rappelé la volonté des Américains de voir un État palestinien et un État israélien vivant côte à côte dans la paix et dans la sécurité. Lui, Netanyahou a refusé ces mots. Donc on a l'impression qu'on est un petit peu piétiné. Et finalement Netanyahou se révèle être le partenaire difficile que tout le monde attendait ici à Washington. Comme dans les années 90, quand il les négociait avec Clinton, Netanyahou était compliqué. Il s'est toujours une situation compliquée avec Netanyahu pour cette première rencontre avec Barack Obama. Que ressort-il de cette rencontre concernant l'autre dossier brûlant du moment, celui de l'Iran ? Sur l'Iran, on a peut-être fait une petite avancée. En tout cas, les Israéliens et les Américains s'entendent un tout petit peu mieux sur ce dossier après cette rencontre entre Obama et Netanyahu. Vous savez que les Israéliens s'inquiètent de l'idée d'Obama de négocier avec les Iraniens. les a rassurés, il leur a proposé un calendrier. On sait désormais que les Américains vont essayer de négocier sérieusement avec les Iraniens début juin après les élections en Iran, mais Barack Obama a aussi expliqué que ces négociations ne dureront pas pour une l'éternité. D'ici la fin de l'année 2009, Obama va essayer de voir où on en est et ça pourrait être déjà la fin des négociations. Ici, c'est perçu à Washington comme peut-être une concession pour les Israéliens.","We find Guillaume Meier in Washington. Guillaume is talking about Palestinian documents and the persisting agreements. It is impossible to tell the Israelis that they want the creation of a Palestinian state. Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, in front of Barack Obama, explained that he was ready to reopen negotiations with the Palestinians. Yet, Netanyahu refused to pronounce the word of the Palestinian state, which is yet to be seen by the roadside that had been accepted by the previous Israeli governments. So we feel like we've made a little back-up. Barack Obama, he reminded the Americans' will to see a Palestinian state and a Israeli state living in peace and security. He, Netanyahu, refused these words. So we feel like we're a little bit pissed off. And finally, Netanyahu reveals himself to be the difficult partner that everyone was waiting for here in Washington. As in the 90s, when he negotiated with Clinton, Netanyahu was complicated. What is the outcome of this meeting concerning the other burning file of the current Iran? Obama reassured them, he offered them a calendar. We now know that the Americans will try to seriously negotiate with the Iranians early June, after the elections in Iran, but Barack Obama also explained that these negotiations will not last forever. Until the end of 2009, Obama will try to see where we are and it could already be the end of negotiations. Here, it is perceived in Washington as perhaps a concession for the Israelis."

La verdad tiene un costo, tiene un costo de tiempos donde vos tenés que sentarte a estudiar y si los es a distancia enfrente a la computadora, que mejor, a cualquier horario en el momento que vos quieras y si querés con tus parejas, con tus hijos y también tiene un costo, un costo de dinero que vos tenés que aprender e invertir, lo que fijaste que la tecnología por la cual estamos saliendo, tuvo que ver con mucha inversión, con muchas ganas, con muchas ganas de evolucionar, de radio transicores. Yo creo que vos te mereces estudiar en forma mensual. ¿Por qué te con tanta sabiduría? Porque todos estos cursos son la sabiduría. Qué canalizado lo que he escuchado de otros y he aprendido con otros. Recángatelo. Cursos a distancias, mensuales. Gracias por escucharme. Lucia, amor. Bendiciones.

Otra vez gracias.","Good morning, I want to introduce you to distance courses, monthly courses to distance. You know, look, many people study seminars here, seminars there, a weekend, one day, two days, three days and in the end they serve as they are not going to serve, but it is little. I'm going to make a reference, look, you have that idea how many hours I study medicine a week, some medicine My student told me 5 hours every day for 5 days 25 hours per week minimum. Study. For 4 hours, it's 100 hours. For 10 months, it's 1000 hours of study. To study a body that comes. We have to study the soul, something that is not seen. How many hours will it depend? A seminar of 3 hours, a seminar of 4 hours, first of the second level of reiki, a study day, a teacher, two classes, in one class. Our seminars from here or from there, from any teacher, are dictated at the end of the week or in the week. But after 20 years of experience, I tell you that they do not reach you. I recommend that you study, that you are able to do that in monthly courses. 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years. Be able to do that because that is the only way to accentuate the knowledge. These courses at a distance will be in videos, recorded live. You will have ... if you enter the course I want to show you a real demonstration so you can see how it is transmitted live. It is very interesting that you receive the four classes recorded live every month. It is very important that you understand that in a seminar or a 7-year seminar, in a 20-year seminar, it is not learned the same as in a year, two years or three years. In the monthly courses it is learned much more. I remember a few years ago when I started and I said I want a serious place and a place where I can and everyone wants it better and everyone wants the truth. Truthfully, it has a cost, it has a time cost where you have to sit down to study and if you are at that distance in front of the computer, what better? At any time, at the moment that you want, if you want, in your walls, with your children, and it also has a cost, a cost of money that you have to learn to invest, look at the technology we are going through, you have to see with a lot of investment, with a lot of desire, with a lot of desire to evolve the radio transistors. I think you deserve to study in a monthly way. Where you will learn much more. I don't want to convince you. I want to activate your real consciousness. That's why I recommend you these courses. Legitim 1, Legitim 2, do one first, then do the other. And the master, what is the best? Look, 20 years ago, for me evolution, for me illumination, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, I myself, Why are you so excited? Because all these courses are wisdom. What have you learned, what have you heard from others? What have you learned from others? Give them back. Courses to the distance. Men's. Thank you for listening to me. Lucia, love. Blessings. We are always in www.eduardojuel.com. We are always with you. We are always with the light. Thank you. Again, thank you."

We have all the places in the old Pazov community, we have the local elections, but we don't have them in Golubina. But this is the procedure of the local elections in Toko. The new Serbia will try to fulfill the pre-election promises, as they did with the help of small, natural gas stations, to bring in foreign investors, and to open new public places. and the lack of access to various services. There are about 100 active members of the Serbian Party. The number of members is more than 300 members. The only thing that is important is the local elections in the old Paz.

No oczywiście co kto lubi, ale ja myślę, że taki typ casku jest najbardziej odpowiedni. Zasadzie dla każdego. Wyglądasz jak ryśkołak.","A helmet with a new shape. We're not a small town. This time we're wearing a freeride helmet with a very elegant roof. It's in very beautiful, fashionable colors. I really like it. Magnetic system. Magnetic system with which you hold your goggles. It doesn't have this classic elastic elastic band that holds goggles. But the goggles are attached to two very interesting bands that hold the goggles in place. I like the new shape of the helmet and it's perfect for hungry people Look, it's not my size, but it's great It's a very interesting plaster Look, I'm afraid it's 18 years old So, here you can change the round rubber so that the helmet looks different. But not only. You can also, because there is a helmet that has holes, holes, holes. In case of rain, it starts to rain. So we have a special cover. Here it is. We have a special cover that can be mounted here instead of these rubber bands. To cover the holes. and that's how it's done, so that the water doesn't get wet and doesn't drip on our heads. You have to believe that by chance you'll be a fanatic. Of course. I like the new shape of the helmet, something really new, something fresh. You know, the helmet wasn't a helmet, if it was missing, in this case, probably a cello, because it's not a tiger, it's a cello. Or some other animal, a male cat. and a lot of big cats. Of course, what anyone likes, but I think that such a helmet is the most wonderful. The principle for everyone. You look like a rabbit."

Lo primero es que si tenés que explicarle a la gente qué cambió en las reglas para establecer candidaturas. Es muy fácil, nadie lo sabe. Desde mi punto de vista, este es una maniobra más de los señores feudales de la política argentina para impedir el nacimiento de lo nuevo. Las mismas personas que destruyeron los partidos políticos tradicionales, peronismo y radicalismo, que estaban absolutamente vitales en el 83 cuando los recibieron, empujan ahora la cuestión que se puede volver al vipartidismo porque se dan cuenta que la gente se ha ido de sus pertenencias. 60% de la población argentina se define a sí misma como política o independiente en las 24 provincias. Esto es una sociedad absolutamente distinta. ¿Cuánto era antes? Antes en la Sierra de Calo Peronista. Nadie era independiente. Cuando vos naciste te pusieron el chupete y ya sabíamos a qué votaba 18 años después. Y yo también. Que era un disparate visto desde hoy. Hoy ningún joven Nace con pertenencia política de modo tal que hay una modificación brutal del escenario político porque para que vos votaras ha sido falta ponerte una marcha peronista, radical, la cuarta internacional, la que te gustan, la que les gustan, tu familia. y no votó tanta gente en la interna radical. No, nadie. No fue una expresión así de participación. A ver, pongámoslo primero en contexto. Todos los gobiernos del mundo y todos los poderes del mundo eligen contra quién van a competir y tratan de eliminar lo que no les conviene. Vos decís que el gobierno es yo el contrincante radical. Pero no hay absolutamente ninguna duda, Cobos, con sus manos y con sus menos era un hombre de cual la sociedad le debía algo Alfonso Sino le debía nada. Después puede pasar que Alfonso Sino era una sorpresa digamos, que eligieron las del elegido mal pero lo que quiero significar es, ha habido muchos intereses en el juego acá. En la Provincia de Bogotá le votaron 120 mil personas, dividido 135 municipios, pusieron votos todas las estructuras radicales que se estaban jugando en la vida que son especialistas en eso, más el gobierno, más la coalición cívica, más el gen. porque el que gana directamente es un radical que juega para el fonsí. De modo que ¿Qué pasó ahí? Es muy gracioso porque el relato de las personas que participaron de selección dicen que a las 11 de la mañana habían votado 100, 200 personas de más de 75 años. La renovación del radicalismo viene de la mano de los afiliados de más de 75 años. En definitiva, todo es un cuento que condice poco con la heredia. ¿Por qué generó lo que generó? Porque en los tres días vimos la foto de todo el peronismo de incidente en un poco repartido, porque algunos llegaron más tarde y se sacaron la foto más tarde, estoy hablando de Narváez y Regutemán. La discusión es cuando empezará la compañía electoral. Hay quienes sostienen que hay que empezar lo más tarde posible, esos son intereses vinculados al gobierno que no necesita que se hable de recambios ni de posibilidades de cambios ahora. La estrategia del gobierno es tratar de y no necesitan llegar al fin de su mandato con la mayor cantidad de poder posible por eso, quícer, dice textualmente, sáquense la urna de la cabeza, dejen de hablar de este tema, ¿no? No necesita que se hable de lecciones, de novedades, de candidatos nuevos, de esperanza, necesitan que se hable de otras cosas. Y otras personas que creen que hay que empezar a ofrecerle a la sociedad en un momento en el cual la sociedad está de compras los productos que la sociedad necesita. Está claro que el 60% decidió que no que no este gobierno. Hay gente que se está fijando, que está preguntando, eso sin amovirle el 60% que dijo no. Esto es hace un año así, 60% que no que no, 20% que sí que sí y había quedado un 20% que ve tantas luces como sombras que a partir de este tensionamiento hasta por realización que el Poder Ejecutivo ensaya desde hace unos 8 o 9 meses le dio 9 puntos al quijarismo, 4 al no y queda un 7 pero en realidad ese 20 más 9, 29 es el mismo 31 que sacaron en junio del año pasado, es decir, no es No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, y eso está el candidato del peronismo federal. ¿Y cómo se va a definir en una interna entre... que participen todos? Yo supongo que lo más inteligente para ellos, para todos, para todas las expresiones políticas, es legitimarse a través de una interna abierta, si no lo obliga incluso la ley esta que todavía no está... Habrá que ver la letra chica, por favor. Exactamente. Jorge, gracias. A ustedes en el próximo volumen que estará nadie, la pronosticadora oficial que nos va a decir cómo sigue el clima político por estos días.","Well, Jorge, the duties were raised. First, if you have to explain to people what the rules were to establish candidacies. It's very easy, nobody knows. From my point of view, this is a more maneuver of the feudal gentlemen of Argentine politics to prevent the birth of the new. The same people who destroyed the traditional political parties, but not radicalism, who were absolutely vital in 1983 when they were received, are now pushing the issue of the I can't go back to the vipartism because people realize that the people have gone from their 60% of the Argentine population to themselves as independent or political, in the 24 provinces. This is a completely different society. How long ago? Before the Peronist radicals were born, no one was independent. When you were born you were put in the chupete and we already knew who voted 18 years later. And I too, who was a shot seen from today. Today no young man is born with political belonging. So there is a brutal modification of the political scenario, because to vote you need to put a radical, radical march, the international quarter, the one you like, the one you like, your family. The first fact then is that the change of legislation does not favor the young parties or the refugees. It does not favor the new, on the contrary, this is a maneuver of the feudalization and of the people who have feudalized democracy. And why did what happened with the triumph of Alfonso? I think it was great, I didn't have anything against Alfonso Cín's figure, because he didn't vote so many people in the radical internal. It wasn't an expression of participation. Let's put it in context first. All the governments of the world and all the powers of the world will choose against who they will compete against and try to eliminate what doesn't suit them. You mean that the government is the radical counter-election. But there is absolutely no doubt that Cobos Alfonso Sino was a man who gave him something. Alfonso Sino was a fool. Then Alfonso Sino was a surprise. They said he was not chosen badly. But what I want to mean is that there have been many interests in the game here. In the military, there were 120,000 people voted. There were 135 municipalities. All the radical structures that were playing in life were voted. They are specialists in that. More the government, more the civic coalition. Because he wants to be a radical man who plays for Alfonso. What did it generate? We saw the picture of the whole of the Peronism of the incident in three days. It was a bit distributed. Some came later and took the picture. I'm talking about Narváez and Rebutemán. The discussion is when to start the electoral campaign. We have to start as late as possible. These are interests linked to the government, which does not need to be talked about in exchange or now. and to reach the end of their mandate with the most power possible. That's why Quinter says, textually, take out the headband. Stop talking about this topic. It doesn't need to be about elections, news, new candidates, hope, it doesn't need to be about other things. And other people who believe that we have to start offering society, at a time when society is buying, the products society needs. It's clear that 60% decided that it's not that this government. There are people who are looking, who are asking, That's unmovable. The 60% that said no. This is a year ago, yes, 60% that said no, 20% that said yes, and there was a 20% left that sees so many lights as shadows, that from this tension, even by the realization that the executive power in Salles, from 1989, gave him 9 points in the National Assembly, 4 to no, and there were 7 left. But in reality, that 20 plus 9, 29 is the same as 31 that they took out last June, that is, no. I have to go because I have little time left. If you have to imagine the scenario, what will be the names in the ballot for the officialism, for the opposite peronism, why? For the progressive space or socialist. There will be a Pino Solanas candidature, there will be a pan-radical candidature, surely Alfonso Zing. No, Biner, no, no, Cobos. Probably if Biner is the president, or Justiniani. There will be an official candidature, which I think is very important. I think that Kisner will not be the candidate. No, Kisner will not be. No, from a point of view, no. But not because he cannot win, but because he could not exercise. No one can assume that 75% of the association against the first day. And the other space, there are Neves, Reutemann, Dualde, Solà, there are many. There are many. No, Dualbaes can not be the candidate presidential, Reutemann said that it does not seem to me that what is called federal peronism is a dispute between Dualde and Solà and there the candidate will come out. This is the candidate of the federal prime minister. And how will he define himself in an internal between all of them? I suppose that the most intelligent thing for them, for everyone, for all political expressions, is to get legitimized through an open internal, if not, it even forces this law that is still not... We will have to see the letter, girl, please. Jorge, thank you. You in the next block will be no one, the official prognosis that will tell us how the political climate is going to be these days."

If I'm invited, yes I would come, if everyone is running too from the team of Novéa, it's a pleasure! You will have to run 10 km! Oh well, it's doable! Yes, well... All the time? All the time, yes, but slowly... Yes! Well, if you finish, I'll get involved... I'll finish without stopping, but not at a fabulous pace! I'll get involved because if you finish 10 km, the Novéa team will give you a confidence! Because we're not sure to win anyway! Oh no, it's sure that I'm not sure to win, right?

A Caserta e nell'Alto-Casertà. Salve, ringrazio Caserta Focus, perché mi dà l'opportunità di avviare questo nuovo percorso insieme all'Udc sul territorio dell'Alto-Casertà, ma anche in provincia di Caserta, avvicinando quando più persone di una rete di amici che negli anni ho costruite, Ho costruito insieme un percorso che dura ormai da 20 anni per rimanciare sul nostro territorio in particolare modo questo nuovo modo di fare politica dell'Udc, abbia anche la competizione elettorale del politico dell'anno prossimo che sicuramente saremo protagonisti con una leanza sul centro-sinistra e anche da chi anni Pagciano dopo domani dal convegno che inizia domani finisce domane da domane finis domani domani domanina domanina domanina domane domane domane domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina domanina dom dell'Udici nel casertano e nell'alto casertano. Con il suo ingresso l'Udici colma un limite storico la presenza dell'alto casertano. Ma in effetti sull'alto casertano c'è stata sempre una presenza dell'Udici. Oggi tendiamo di migliorarla integrando i nuovi di questa componente che più vicino a me che sul diciamo sul comprensorio si avvia a integrarsi con il vecchio che ha rappresentato lo Dicci sul territorio per dare una svolta, una svolta nelle idee, una svolta nella gestione, perché noi per Antonio Masia siamo un poco definiti come quelli che hanno capacità amministrative, con questo vogliamo dare una svolta e questo per fare in modo, per creare anche consenzi per lo stesso Dicci. Uno dei punti critici in questo momento a livello provinciale e legato dalla gestione del ciclo integrato dei rifiuti, lei si può considerare uno dei massimi esperti in quanto pioniere nella gestione dei rifiuti e presidente di un consorzio, il vecchio C1 che è stato Fiori Allocchiello per Tandiane della provincia di Caserta. in questo momento in cui iniziamo a intitolare dove, e su questo anche Gizi, la Presidente di Gizi la pensiamo in un stesso modo, individuare dove fare gli impianti, perché è il punto terminale della raccolta differenziale, perché gli impianti consentono di portare a termine quel ciclo che effettivamente non è mai decollato al di là della raccolta differenziata che ha aggiunto anche picchi massimi del 30% o 35% sul nostro territorio anche avendo comuni del nostro vecchio bacino che hanno avuto dei premi al premio riciclone a Rimini o in altre manifestazioni dai consorti di Filira però abbiamo avuto sempre difficoltà nel martire sia l'umito che il rifiuto è non differenziato. Questo è un problema serio, perché il rifiuto è non differenziato e il umido vanno a danneggiare qualsiasi percentuale. La provigia di Casetta se non risolve questo problema, oggi vede in difficoltà 1.200-1.300, dipendendo ma pure di più rispetto a se consideriamo anche quelle di Napoli, è solo esclusivamente colpa di una riforma che non ha portato ai risultati che doveva portare, quello come la soppressione dei bacini territoriali. I bacini territoriali consentono ad avere un rapporto più umano con i comuni, perché uno dei problemi principali è la distanza non politica, ma la distanza La distanza abbastanza notevole è quella che riguarda i sindaci con le bestituzioni in campanica e si occupano dei rifiuti. Questo consente che i comuni non si sentono coinvolte sia perché non sono garantiti al 100% con un servizio funzionante e sia perché non c'è capacità decisionale da parte dei sindaci non essendoci più un'assemplere dei sindaci che detenere per il politico dei bacini questa distanza far sì che i comuni non pagano più le rispettive, diciamo, quote e in più i servizi proprio in basillare. L'ardove c'è anche un altro problema, i cittadini pagano regolarmente la tassa sui rifiuti. Questa tassa non viene pagata al consorzio unico e di conseguenze ci troviamo che la tassa non è regione deve sopperire o il governo centrale Roma deve sopperire agli stipendi. Servizi vengono fatti in malo modo e comuni continuano a non pagare. Se non c'è questo avvicinarsi delle parti dopo terminato il processo degli impiandi noi non avremo nessun risultato e avremo solo un problema serio che riguarda il personale che al di là del consorcio su questo possiamo anche parlare ore e ore per chi possiamo dire dove sta le subbero e dove ci è stata la incapacità di amministrare quindi facendo assunzioni scelerate, dove c'è stata buona amministrazione dove c'era bisogno di personale e non è stato possibile più farlo come caserta 1 che era un po' che fiora l'occhio come giustamente hai detto. Queste difficoltà oggi ne fa carico la provincia ma con sforzo sicuramente presidente penso che risolva il problema ma ho dei seri dubbi sul futuro del personale fin quando i comuni continuano a non pagare noi avremo sempre un servizio non perfetto. Grazie a Gianluigi Santillo un saluto a tutti i visitatori di Caserta Focus Montonetta. Grazie a voi.","From Luigi Santillo, after a phase of separation and separation from politics, he returns to the UDC.

This new way of doing the UTC policy, also having the electoral competition of the next year's politicians, which we will surely be protagonists with a left-wing alliance, The meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, the meeting will be held tomorrow, with its entrance to the Lodici with a historic limit the presence of the high-class but in fact there has always been a presence of the Lodici today we tend to improve it by integrating the new components that are closer to me than on the let's say on the comprehensive we have to integrate with the old man who represented the decision on the territory to give a turn, a turn in ideas, a turn in management because we, for Antonomasia, we are a little defined as those who have administrative capacity, with this we want to give a turn and this to make the way to create also consensus for the same decision. One of the critical points at this time, at the provincial level, is linked to the management of the cycle of refuges. Can you consider yourself one of the most experienced, as a pioneer in the management of refuges and president of an old C1 consortium, which was Fiori Allocchiello for Tandiana of the province of Caserta? The beginning of the Casserta can be taken away from the moment we start to identify where, and on this point, the president and the president of the Gizzi, we have to identify where to plant them, because the terminal point of the harvest of the fruits, the differential harvest, because the plants allow to bring to the end that cycle, and it is not ever taken away from the side of the different collections that have also reached maximum peaks of 30% or 35% on our territory, also having common ones of our old basin that have won awards, the RIMI RICICLONE award or other exhibitions of the Filiro consortium, but we have always had difficulties in the hammer, both in the mud that the refueling has not been differentiated. This is a serious problem because the refueling has not been differentiated. It is a problem that damages any percentage. The province of Casetta, if it does not solve this problem, today you see in difficulty 1,200, 1,300, depending on the most than we consider the ones in Naples, It was exclusively the fault of a reform that did not bring the results that I had to bring, as was the suppression of territorial bans. The territorial bans allow for a more human relationship with the communes, because one of the main problems is the non-political distance, The distance is quite noticeable, regarding the syndicates with the best institutions in the countryside that occupy the river. This means that the municipalities do not feel involved, both because they are not guaranteed 100% with a functioning service and because there is no decision-making capacity from the syndicates, they are no longer a sample of the syndicates that are the government, the programmatic and political direction of the banks, this distance makes the communists no longer pay the respective quotes and the services of the Baselian people. Where there is another problem, the citizens regularly pay the tax on the refugees. This tax is not paid to the sole consortium and consequently we find that The government of the central region must support the independence of the country. The services must be done in a bad way and the municipalities must continue to pay. If there is no such thing as approaching the parts after the process of the invasions, we will not have any results and we will only have a serious problem regarding the personnel. We can talk about where the sub-mero is and where we can manage it, making excellent assumptions, where we can manage it, where we still need to be personal and we can't do it anymore, like Caserta 1, which was a bit like Fiorello Chiello, as you said. it is charged with the province but with effort certainly president I think that solves the problem but I have serious doubts about the future of the staff until the municipalities continue to pay us we will always have a not perfect service. Perfect, thank you already Luigi Santillo a greeting to all the visitors of the certain focus. Thank you."

And I kept putting it off, you know, because I'm hungry. I don't want a fast. Anybody here want a fast? I mean, you can't wait to not have food. No, no, no, one of us. I like to eat. I'm from the south. I'm asking Tammy while we're eating breakfast what we're having for lunch. And just on the way to sit down for lunch, what do we do? for dinner. And later I'm saying, what are we doing for tomorrow for breakfast? I mean, I guess food is good. I like to eat. So this fasting thing, let's find somebody, the real spiritual people, put them in a room and let them fast. And then we get the results. No, fasting is for every believer. And I believe, I believe I've heard from God. I believe that God is calling our church to a 21 day fast starting August the first. This coming Wednesday. 21 days. The first 21 days. of the month of August. August is the eighth month of the year. Eight is the number of new beginnings in the Bible. I believe it's a prophetic statement. Usher, can we pass out those prayer and fasting cards really quickly? I believe that we are on the precipice of new beginnings. Would you like to have a new beginning, a fresh touch of God, a fresh spark in your heart for your spouse? Better than that, would you like to have a fresh spark in your heart with passion? for God. The dullness of Bible and prayer and worship and things is going to come back to life again. It's going to be sharp and it's going to be powerful. It's going to be life changing. God's about to come supernaturally and touch us and radically change our lives. And I'm saying this is a moment when God's going to move powerfully. We're going to push through the prayer bubble and get into the prayer breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthroughs coming because we're going to seek him. We're going to, and listen by the way, when you get this card, I'm going to go ahead and talk about it while you're getting it. On the front, it's just a little note from me, then it says, what will you fast? Can I talk to you about it for a second? Everybody look at me. What will you fast? It names some things here. You can do a Daniel fast, which we just mentioned in the book of Daniel. It says that Daniel ate no pleasant food. Modern terms will be like, okay, I'm gonna give up coffee for 21 days. I'm gonna give up sweet things. I'm gonna give up breads. I'm gonna eat limited. Some days I'll just have juice all day. I'm gonna mix it up. But a Daniel fast would be really easy. easily workable for all of us. You can do an entertainment fast. I think we all should do this. Yes, I am going to watch some of the Olympics, yes. But I mean, we're going to be careful. We're not going to be consumed by movies and Facebook. And a lot of time we give normally an entertainment, we're going to pull that back. And you'll feel the withdrawal. It's almost as strong as a food withdrawal. Because we're so given entertainment. We're going to say no to it just for a while so we can sharpen, sharpen our spirit. We can all do. Thirdly, you can do a partial day fast, maybe you miss one or two meals in one day. Or you can do a complete fast. The last part of this, you can teach your children to fast. Parents, of course, feed your children. But you can teach your kids. In the evening, maybe let's say it's dinner time and you're used to having dessert. You say, hey kids, come over. We're not gonna have dessert today. Here it is, we're gonna put this off. Why? I want that. Well, because we're sacrificing for God. Does God want to eat it? He's not going to eat it, but we're going to put it aside because if we put God first and not have the dessert, we take some time and pray God's going to bless our community. Take a moment, teach the children, have them walk through this journey. It's for the whole church, every single person. On the back it has a calendar, the 21 days, by the way, there's a little bit of a mistake. The days of the week across the top of wrong. The first is actually Wednesday. So just keep making sure you're alert. starts on Wednesday the first, goes for 21 days. Normally in past days we would proclaim a fast for a week or 10 days or something and I'd say, hey choose a day, do what you can. This time, are you with me? Look at me. This time, I'm asking if this is your church home, if he's even close to being your church home, I'm asking you to fast for 21 days. I'm not saying you can't eat, I'm saying 21 days of focus, diligent, seeking of God and give up some entertainment You'll know it. I'm going to turn that off for a few minutes. I'm going to have less today. Fasting is sacrificing. It's getting for 21, not one day. Do one you can. Everybody in the church, we're fasting for 21 days. And like Daniel, I believe that, yeah, we're maybe going to encounter some resistance, some agitation from hell, but we're going to get some answers from heaven. We're going to pray and we're going to get heaven to touch our earth. It's going to radically change how we do life. I'm telling you answers are coming. We're going to do it for 21 days. On the back it says, when will you pray? When will you pray? I would suggest you write in. Maybe it's going to be in the morning before work, or maybe you have a changing schedule and you can do it, you can fast. I mean, you can pray a certain morning when you're going to work later. You can do it at lunch break or in the evening with your spouse or your children or some friends. The key here is we're not just fasting, we're fasting and praying. Fasting and not praying we're just going on a diet There are dietary benefits many doctors prescribe fasting it actually make you healthy It'll be good for you to cleanse the system But it's going to cleanse the spirit to gonna cleanse the soul And I'm asking all of us mark down when will you pray? We're gonna pray in connect groups. We're gonna ask all the connect groups to have a very specific prayer focus during the month of August One last thing we're proclaiming Saturday nights for the next number of weeks Saturday everybody say Saturday night Saturday night from seven o'clock to eight o'clock in the evening PM We're gonna meet here and we're gonna pray for an hour one hour We used to do this many years ago. We're gonna start it up again. I'm telling you we're gonna come on Saturday night Everybody, please join me starting next Saturday. We'll notify you again remind you Saturday night prayer for the next few weeks. We are gonna seek God and we're gonna find God One last thing what will you pray for? One of the greatest problems of this type of an event is that we weren't careful. Individually, we won't get focused. What are you praying for? Write it out. That's what this card is for. We've given you eight spaces because eight is the number of new beginnings. What eight things? Family, be personal, some financial thing. Name specifically what is begin to pray and intercede. And when you're praying daily, you say, Lord, I'm fasting. Lord, I'm praying. I'm seeking you. And I ask you in heaven to come touch my earth and then name it. those things and you watch in the next couple of months as miracles begin to take place in this house and your life in our lives together as we take time to seek God. Come on somebody say amen. I'm in.","I've been telling our church, maybe you don't remember, I've talked about this maybe a few times in the last few months, that I want to call our church to a 21 day fast.

Having a good time. I gotta say this game is awesome Yet it does have some drawbacks and I'm gonna get into that a little bit later What I give you guys my overall review of the game Maybe save you guys some money or maybe in Tisha to buy it. We'll see so let's start with the graphics I like the way the graphics look it's self-shaded I understand it's a bit cartoony, but you know what it's a different world than what we're used to seeing with first-person shooter military shooters, you know, it gets a little old I like the I like the overall style. I like how everything is highlighted or Has a stroke basically I know it's from if you ever use Photoshop, but it's got this like black stroke around Beast mode you could you could hear bullets like whiz and past you the monsters sound great You knew when the characters were coming the music in the game is like certain points is like rock music, which is kind of cool and then at the same time it's got Just this nice music that goes along with the game well it just the overall like the story is convoluted yet the same time with the sound and the graphics it all kind of makes sense in a weird way and I just like the overall look and feel of the game itself I I would definitely say it's a world that I like being in and if you do already if you like the graphics to sound and the gameplay mechanics, which we'll get into in a second You're gonna like this game. You're gonna have a good time if you don't if you think that if you don't like the graphics then you're not gonna like this game because you're gonna be in this world a lot So let's talk about overall like the gameplay. There's four different four different classes that you can use and it's commando siren uh i believe gun zirker and assassin now i was the gun zirker and basically what you can do is you can eventually upgrade and your first point you uh you purchase you can um dual wield your weapons at a certain point in time and it just allows you like go into this like beast mode type type of setting and it's really helpful for your uh for your team obviously every class is helpful for your team overall But it's just done in a way where you feel like you're just totally transforming your character and being like just straight up beast and I really like that about That class and I want to experiment with some of the other classes But I just I knew that was the one that I wanted to be anyway, so I saw the commercials and stuff so The combat itself is just like Call of Duty in a sense. Actually the button layout is just like default button button layout for cod and what's nice is you can customize all the buttons to whatever you want. the story really is about. I wasn't really paying attention at all. But it doesn't really matter. That's what the game's about. They advertised it's like a bazillion different guns and they're not kidding. There's so many guns that I've already picked up and experimented with. It's just nuts. And I highly recommend War of the Lasting was telling me this too. You wanna kinda go with the, if you can, if you can pick up a gun that also deals out like fire with your ammo that's a really good idea because we were doing that later on in the game we were beasting some of the characters it was awesome but that's what it is there really is all there is to this game and it's four player co-op which is awesome and I highly recommend like actually playing with some of your peeps or finance and people online that you can play with because the game itself like playing solo is fun I was playing solo with the I'll maybe call this a part one of my review but at the same time the fork in the road really is Are you going to like it and I'm not sure I can see why a lot of people are disappointed with this game There's a lot of people on one side saying well well CP. It's just the same thing as the first one Well or just more of the same. I understand that but why complain about that? I feel like they have made some improvements with the equipment and the way you level up and the fact that the enemies don't respawn at all. I mean they don't seem to really respawn as much as they used to. Or at all, which is nice. I didn't like that about the first one. And I also see why some people don't like the cartoony graphics. And there isn't anything else to the game guys. There's that's... I hate to say it but I'm addicted to it because I'm thinking right now like, alright how am I going to upgrade you know my class or what assassin class be better for this level I mean just all those different types of possibilities make you really start thinking like hmm you know and when a game does that it's got its hooks into you I always say it always like if you're ever thinking about a game when you're when you're away from it it that's really like that means the game's good so I gotta say overall I get this like a 9.5 so far but it doesn't have any kind of like multiplayer which I don't even know how they would do that but doesn't have any like Call of Duty multiplayer there's no like team deathmatch or capture the flag but I would definitely say if you're waiting for Call of Duty or Black Ops and you want a diversion this would definitely you know wet your appetite for a little bit until those games come out so or or not you know if you're not into those games I definitely say get this game because you could play this game forever and experiment with different guns, different classes, and just have a good time with friends. So that's my overall review. Never eat sawing waffles. I love you guys. Take care. Be good or be good at it. And I am out. Peace.","Monster you guys what is up in a CP the one and only monster gamer playing with war everlasting and Grover who did my outro so? Having a good time.

I love when you shoot people, there's just points flying everywhere, and that's how the first one was too. That's what made the first one awesome. And the sound.

Me diga inglês porque eu entendo português. Obrigado muito. Mas, como vocês podem ver, o rapaz está malhado, está sarado, para as meninas de Tambacuri, por exemplo, que quando chegar aí vai dar trabalho demais, as mulheres de Tambacuri. Mas, estamos aqui, Deus vai deixar na palhinha aí, do que ele acha da América, qual a sensação de estar na América, qual são os planos dele, o futuro, a palavra está com você dele. é muito grande demais. Saudade dos familiares, dos velhos amigos. É isso aí. Em busca do futuro melhor, estamos sofrendo de correr atrás. Mulher não tem não, né? Mulher não tem não. É só que, ó, internet mesmo. Aqui é tudo assim... É tudo baseado aqui em dinheiro. E essa vida que a gente leva aqui. Quer ver mulher aqui, só por internet, mesmo em soceca mesmo. Falando sério. Quer vir? e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e... e Eu vou acabar de apresentar vocês no meu quarto.

I live here in this room alone, as you can see, it's a marriage bed. My brother is here today, he is giving me this visit today, for those who don't know, it's Leo, my brother, he will talk to you, give a hi to you. My brother, I go for my house now. Talk to me in English because I understand Portuguese. Thank you so much. But as you can see, the boy is sick, he's sick, for the girls of Tambacuri, for example, because when he arrives there it will be too much trouble for the girls of Tambacuri. But we are here, God will leave the stick there, what he thinks of America, what is the feeling of being in America, what are his plans for the future, the word is with you there. That's it guys, the first thing we do here is to make friends, who come together with the city people and such, with the little button because the solution is It's a great thing. The family, the old friends... That's it. In search of a better future, we're suffering from running behind. There's no woman. There's no woman. It's just the internet. Everything is based on money. And this life we take here. Want to see women who are only on the internet? Women are only dry. Seriously. Want to come? I can't say the same thing, because I always have contacts, I always get so nice, I always get so nice in Brazil, I always run back and I always have the same experiences in America, I always have the same relationships with people who haven't had it for a long time, but I learned a lot from this too. And I leave it to you, that life, Our lives, our lives in itself, are not based on this, not on money, not on everything in life. It's something more important than everything, it's our family. People who really love us, and friends too, you forgot about friends. Let me tell you that we are here in search of a better future, simply because, fortunately, in Brazil, we don't have this opportunity to have this life, in a dignified, honest life. I know some of the difficulties that my parents have, but I want to give a hug to all the people who directly, today I'm directly calling my person, to the people who don't know me, I wish you all the best, God can help each one of you, and we will see, with the people who know me, we will see, soon, soon, we will be there to enjoy all, to take a walk, and that's what I have to say. I'll introduce you to my room. That's it guys. With the cut, everything you said. But if you want to be a woman, just follow me. It's strong. I'm not like that. You have to be too much. The event organizer, America. Wether Protochus. For those who don't know, I met Wether Protochus here in the USA. It's the fair. We have some contacts, we take friends to the party, to the ballad. In Brazil, I was like that. What's the difference? This one... It's there, it's there. It will change, it will change. It has to be Janas. I know it. I know it. I know it. I know it. I know it.

Am I now completely confused to be an actor when I get gifts? Just like these cards. Who's sending me something like that? What if I can't? Do I have to prove it?

No, and no one says chants, bars, chants and that kind of thing. A lot of people say that. It's hip and slang. No, that's not it. Okay, okay. I just wanted to make you happy because you got no cards. Oh, okay. Well, I'm convinced that I don't have to lose anyone. And most women probably know that I don't like cards, so that's why. Yeah, I didn't know that. But yeah, I have to go.

Los siglos 16 y 17 en España le atraen de alguna forma. Sí, sin duda. ¿Y ese rostro que se ve ahí? No sé, no tengo idea. Eso es un autoretrato de Velázquez. También una interpretación mía bastante moderna. Era el primer cuadro que quiso de pintar de la serie de Velázquez. Hay mucho parenteco en Velázquez con Salmucas de Barrameda. Sí, hay, a través de su muestro. Aquí tenemos el Conde Duque de Olivares. Un cuadro que en el original es bastante oscuro, bastante dramático, y yo quiso de quitar un poquito la dramática y pone en primer plan el caballo andaluz que a mí me fascina bastante también. Hay mucha presencia del caballo en su obra. Sí, sí, sí. El caballo siempre ha sido el animal número uno. Aquí tenemos a Pat Checo, el maestro de Veláquez, que es San Luqueño, o era San Luqueño, incluso pautizado en la Iglesia de la U. Un puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro puro pu y a parte de eso está hablando de la confrontación entre un joven y una vieja. ¿Y ahí encontramos? un capricho me ocurrió porque yo estoy y todavía estoy con la idea de algún día empezar a hacer una serie que hace posible llevar el cuadro entre comillas a la calle y por eso tengo que pintar la ropa así tenemos manera de encendiar el arte que tenemos en casa me parece muy interesante Esa es otra imagen de una exposición en Suiza, en Zurich, donde estoy explicando exactamente a los cuatro que he pintado aquí, que parecía a esa gente también un poquito demasiado colorido, muy alegro, muy loco para esa gente, era mucho colorido. Pero como he traído también vino de aquí, se tranquilizaron un poquito. El vino siempre templa. Sí, sí, sí. Y de una forma muy elegante. Lo hemos pasado bien todos. ¿No ha perdido nadie la bombotura? No, no. Me da la impresión de que usted no renunciaría de ninguna forma a irse de estos andurriales de este sur de España y sin perdiendo el tapeo, los atardeceres, los amaneceres. Me arrepiento solamente de no haber venido mucho antes. No, no. Estoy muy feliz aquí y ha sido una de las decisiones o la decisión más importante y más justa en mi vida. ¿Ustedes amanecian o chese con el parque nacional de Doñana por delante? Sí, sí. Eso llama tanto la atención y aunque más para una persona como yo que no. Yo no sabía que es el mar. Para muchos años, primeros años de mi vida eso influye muchísimo. Lo que no conocemos como niño nunca nos parece no amar. Es decir, lo que como adulto se aprende, como adulto se ve por primera vez, siempre es impresionante y nunca va a hacer algo normal, algo corriente. Y lo que conocemos de niños es lo normal. Y por eso esa tierra para mí es un... como digo, un espectáculo continuando. Porque nunca me parece normal. Siempre me parece muy interesante, me parece muevo, me parece... me parece digno de pintarlo cada vez de nuevo de otra manera así que lo tengo mejor. Al principio me da usted la sensación de un personaje enigmático, enigmático, sin embargo, me da sensación de un personaje bastante alegre, bastante adentrado en nuestra sociedad con mucha ganadería de ser con la gente, de realmente estar con la gente. ¿A qué horas trabaja usted? Porque con tanta capacidad para pintarle, que no puedo decir que no puedo venir porque a esa hora siempre pinto. esa hora es para eso y esa hora es para eso. Yo nunca he sido así. A lo mejor tiene que ver con mi profesión, con la sensibilidad, porque no cada hora es la misma cada día. Hay tardes estupendos para pintar y hay tardes que ni pienso tocar un pincel. Por eso lo que manda más que nada es si yo quiero pintar, pinto. el tiempo que no puedo pintar, dedico a otras cosas y aparte de eso me encanta estar en la calle, estar entre la gente, entre esas personas que forman parte de mi nueva tierra, así que ahora no hay. Y muchas veces incluso, aunque la luz es fantástica, pinto de noche con un foco eléctrico. cuando le vienen ya, no. Eso pasa.","He knows a lot and he also knows a lot, it's a charge that is seen in the posture of the person. The 16th and 17th centuries in Spain they bring him in some way? Yes, yes, without a doubt. And that face that you see? I don't know, I have no idea. That is another portrait of Velázquez, also a very modern interpretation of me. It was the first painting that I wanted to paint in Velázquez's series. There are many relatives of Velázquez with Salmucas de Barrameda. Yes, through that master. Here we have the Condi Duque of Olivares. A painting that is quite dark and dramatic in the original. I wanted to remove the dramatic part a bit. and I put in the foreground the Andalusian horse that fascinates me a lot. There is a lot of presence of the horse in his work. Yes, yes, yes. The horse has always been the number one animal. Here we have Pat Checo, the master of the Beláquees, who is Saint Luqueño, or is it Saint Luqueño? Even baptized in the Church of the U. Here we have the old frying eggs, which is also a very typical 4-year-old. It fascinates me the 5th and 6th century, exactly because of the painting that was there. A very direct painting, a very realistic painting. And we found a jacket painted. I'm still thinking about starting a series that makes it possible to take the four of us to the street. That's why I have to wear the clothes. We have a way of turning on the art we have at home. It seems very interesting to me. That's another image of an exhibition in Switzerland, in Zurich, where I'm explaining exactly the four paintings I've painted here that seemed a bit too colorful for those people. I was very happy and very crazy for those people. It was very colorful. But as I brought wine from here, they calmed down a little. The wine always has a plan. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And in a very elegant way. We have had a good time. You have not lost any passion, have you? No, no. I feel that you would not give up in any way to leave these andurrials of this south of Spain and without losing the tapioca, I regret not having come much earlier. I'm very happy here and it has been one of the most important and most fair decisions in my life. Did you go to Manesilla at night with the national park of Doña por Delante? Yes. That's what draws so much attention, and even more for a person like me who doesn't. I didn't know what the sea is. For many years, for many years of my life, that influences me a lot. And what we don't know as a child, it never seems to us to love. That is, what as an adult, you learn what as an adult, it's always impressive to see it for the first time and it never makes something normal, something current. And what we know about children is normal. And that's why that land for me is like a show continuing because it never seems normal to me. It always seems very interesting to me, it seems like a game, it seems like I think it's worthy of painting it every time in a different way. So I have it better. At first I was feeling enigmatic, enigmatic. I was feeling a very happy character, very well-informed in our society. With a lot of desire to relate it to people. Yes, that's what I really feel and that's how I want to be. And if it seems a little closed, it has not been my intention and it has been a valid idea because it really is not. What do you work on now? Because with so much capacity to paint, I imagine you won't have hours. I said it in the morning and in the afternoon. No, there are no hours. Not only because I can't always say I stay at home from that hour to that hour and I paint because there are many times a little thing like that for the morning, enjoying an interview here in Chipión, that I can't say I can't come because I always paint at that hour. I'm not a very strict person like many Germans are. Very quadratic, this That's why I've never been like this. Maybe it has to do with my profession, with sensitivity. Not every work is the same every day. There are late students to paint, and there are late students who don't even think about painting. That's why what I love most is if I want to paint, I paint. I can't paint other things, and I love that. It's on the street. It's between people, between those people who are part of my new land. So there's no work. And many times, even though the light is fantastic, I paint at night with an electric light. That happens."

Y esto es los materiales. Cinta de teflón y grifo termostático. La primero que hacemos es cerrar la llave de paso. Así verificamos que no salga agua por el grifo. Antes de hacer esto desenroscamos con la mano el flexo de la ducha. Desenroscamos con la llave fija las tuercas que sujetan el grifo antiguo. También lo podemos hacer con una llave inglesa, pero con la llave fija es más improbable que cerrar el grifo. En cualquier caso siempre es es muy importante ya que nos permite quitar las impurezas y así evitar rayones en el cartucho cerámico del grifo termostático. Para ello taponamos la toma de agua con el tapón y abrimos el paso de agua para que salga por la otra. Hacemos la operación al inversa. Antes de colocar el grifo, medimos la distancia de la estación de la estación de agua. entre agujero y agujero que sea de 15 centímetros. En este caso lo es. Si no fuera la medida 15 centímetros utilizaríamos estas piezas que se llaman excéntricas. Estas nos ayudarán a conseguir la distancia deseada. Cubrimos las roscas con teflón bien apretado. Será suficiente con realizar dos vueltas en sentido de la aguja del reloj. A continuación colocamos los embellezadores del grifo nuevo. Tendremos cuidado con los filtros y las darandelas que van dentro de las tuercas del nuevo grifo porque podrían caerse. el cuerpo de la grifería a las tomas. Enroscamos las tuercas con una llave fija. Para colocar el tubo flexible primero lo apretamos con la mano. Si no quedaría fijo nos ayudaríamos con unos alicates. Una vez colocado el grifo termostato procedemos a abrir la llave de paso y verificar el funcionamiento. Suele venir ajustado a 38 grados, si este no fuera el caso ajustaríamos el termostato.

It regulates the temperature by mixing cold water and hot water, so it saves water and energy. Another advantage is that it avoids the changes in temperature when another griffin is opened in the apartment. These are the tools we are going to use. English or fixed? Metro. Level. Alicates. Water thermometer. and a cloth to clean the tub and these are the materials It is very important to clean the tubers, as it helps to avoid the impurities in the ceramic cartridge. We tap the water bottle with the tap and open the water bottle to get out. We do the opposite. Before placing the bottle, we measure the distance between the bottle and the bottle. We cover the threads with a tight teflon, it will be enough to make two laps in the sense of the watch needle. Next, we place the new griffin. We will be careful with the filters and the rinds that go inside the nuts of the new griffin because they could fall. We adjust the screws to the new griffin. We tighten the body of the engraving to the screws. We thread the nuts with a fixed key. To place the flexible tube, first we tighten it with our hand. If it would not be fixed, we would help with some pliers. Once the thermostat is placed, we proceed to open the step key and verify the operation. It usually comes adjusted to 38 degrees. If this was not the case, we would adjust the thermostat. To do this, we remove the embezzer from the regulator handle of the temperature. We have access to the prisoner. We turn it clockwise to get more hot water and check the temperature with the thermometer. If it is correct, we put the thermometer again and tighten it with a screwdriver. Another option to adjust the temperature of the thermostat without having to disassemble it is to regulate it by using the cutting keys, giving more hot water and remaining pressure to the waffle. you can learn much more in the demonstration class."

My contribution to this book is very modest because of my ill health. I have not been able to write too much. It comprised mainly of the statements which I made when I was in prison in 1972 after nine years of the Constitution. As you know, I was detained in a food stall operation in February 2nd, 1993. It was the last one to come out from that batch of the news. So we say we must see something to show the pen times. Otherwise we probably will lose face. and health and ransom to export statements of repentance and compensation. So the whole thing worked out to having to issue a statement of repentance, which I refuse. Subsequently, I was detained for another over 10 years after the screening of the society. So a total of 19 years and eight months longer than my life sentence. The victims will be released after 30 years after the initial, one-year initial. With no charge, I was detained for longer than a lifetime. A lot of the verbal rules have been set recently on the right of the court detainees to appeal to a device reward. I want to tell you my experience of this device reward. After about one year of detention, I was asked to go to the prison the main day. I was given a notice to see that I had to appear before the person who was the next day. I was given a full, full-stabbed paper of so-called trash sheets. I said, I want to keep this sheet of paper so I can pack all my mixed coins. I said, no, you come up to the table, just read it. And he took it. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer. I said, no, you can have my license, call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call my lawyer, because I cannot. I said, I'm going to call So this morning I was called to the high court with hand-hand clouds and all that. And I appeared before the Christy God from Christy God of three persons. I was called to that in his room, two other persons. One was an accident in Elias, and the other was a lawyer, and the whole family came to him. And he was being a thing of the mind. So from this so-called touch, what are blank spaces? The first touch is what are blank spaces? In my 30 years in prison, I was in practically all the prisons in Singapore except of course the female prison. And then the Dutch says, no, no, let the doctor have this seat. There's no question of comparing the court. So I gave a three hours stay in there. We bound all the so-called targets. One of the targets was in fact a false charge. It was charged for the one of the eight plunder of humans to protect all this tradition. As a matter of fact, I didn't have the privilege to be one of the eight. In fact, I was too excited to be one of the eight. And then I was not one of the eight. So why should I be so excited? I actually was one of the eight. The least eight were the quicker, the tough, the pace being poor, and the quicker and the harder, by the money itself was now beginning. So recently we have heard already so-called rule of law. Now there is a detention without trial and ISA, a law which makes a mockery of the concept of rule of law. The rule is a law that is outside the rule of law. Once you are detained under the ISA, you have no legal defence whatsoever. I tried the heaviest copers, twice. One question I succeeded for a technical error on the court. of the government. We did not sign my intervention. We were supposed to sign by our minister. But it was very difficult to see the service. So from that account, the court has to release us from a technical point. So when I was released, there was a special time waiting for me outside the police office. I was being arrested while I was in the jail. It was a mock release. And for that, previous courtiers, our Spanish, was being sent to jail. the most hideous of all detention centers, the Central Police Station pickpockets. There was a place, a small street, to pick human beings, or with anyone, that allowed human beings. The streets were so dark, so steeply, and so ill-regulated that you cannot stand inside the human being's powers. But I was brought in there for 34 hours a day. And the whole place was infested with ducks. I had a lot of ducks for company. the light was so dim that I could hardly see the crease on my hand. So immediately the fire of us went on hunger strike."

He's a former bank robber on the East Coast who got a sweetheart deal with the FIB and managed to retire to Los Santos. However, his wife spent most of his money and he is forced to go back to crime in order reclaim his fortune.  Michael's story will center around how the breakdown of his bought idyllic life pushes a man to breaking point. He is described as a man with everything and nothing to lose both at the same time, and his seemingly blisful existence in San Andreas will be changed forever by the events of GTA V.  In IGN's Meet the Cast article, series creator Dan Houser of Rockstar Games outlined more information about Michael's character.  ""Michael, to me, is... Who is he? I know who he is, I'm just trying to... He's the person who is trying to ignore some rather large mistakes that they have made. The person who's trying to forget about certain practical but still selfish decisions that they took. He's a man, also, obsessed by images and by appearances and who, when the world doesn't live up to those images and appearances, doesn't know what to do. He just retreats into his head. What he also is, when we started out... What he kind of evolved into as we began thinking about him and developing him... He was the first character we came up with. He began as the idea of, what happens to a regular GTA protagonist after they retire? Then you think, what would make him retire?

We made sure that our honest decisions and our commitment to the same goal were also reflected in the meeting. I don't want to change my mind, Mr. President. I don't want to continue standing and making it clear. I want to continue talking and we are in constant contact with these issues. I don't want to continue to be concerned with the issues we have been facing. There are issues of discrimination, the democratization, the lack of respect for the people, and all of this is possible. We are sure that there are conditions for the hearing of the president and the car, we will consider it as an consideration, but we are sure that he is on the same page with Ibn-Allah Ta'ala. and the Iraqi government and the rest of the country. What is the topic? Who are the moving parties? This is a well-known topic, unfortunately, in the international parties, in Iran, the Iraqi political scene is being displayed, and at least, the media is being displayed. I don't know why, I didn't leave the country from Iran, I left the country from Haris, and only two standards, the same as the refugee and the refugee, this is the first and the second is the one that is not included in the internal affairs. This is a matter that we are not aware of, neither before Iran nor from other Iran. We have been working on the issue of the Iranian government. The issue of my administration as an Iraqi president is a difficult one, not a correct one. The number of news media has been rising. And it is at a very low level of intelligence. This is on the side. On the other hand, we are Iraqi, we believe in the democratic work and the joint work. I think that there is no permanent person. If the Iraqi government takes this decision, it will make sure that it will not be able to do so. and this unfortunately, it has targeted me personally. This is not new to us, as it is known that Iran has a red line for all Iraqis and it has personally been in the last elections and it has been in the past. And it is in my opinion that Iran is wrong. In this context, we are wrong and a big mistake and we are wrong. I have been given the information about the establishment of a new constitution that is based on the actions of some of the groups that exist to cover Iran with false information. For example, I have been given the information that I have banned the extradition of Iran and the Sultanate. I have not been given the information to the Sultanate, to the Prime Minister, to the family of the family. Unfortunately, there are some sides in Iran that accept this as a fact. But we always talk about Iran and not Iran. When you interfere in the affairs of the Arab world, whether in Iran or other countries, the situation will be reversed. It is true that maybe in the years of the past two decades, it will be the same as the long-term. But in the final stage, this issue will be reversed in the countries that interfere in the Arab world. I am going to speak to Iran and the Iranian government that we were the most concerned about the building of the region and its protection and its dignity. We are both the same, not Iran, but the right to the people to the people of the country."

U ovom periodu definitivno je taj deo završen, ostavio samo trotori koji su sa leve i sa desne strane i oni će biti rešeni s tim da se imoviske pravni odnosi reše. Širi na ulici je 6,5 metara, kao što vidite jedna od važnih sobrećanica koja spaja Erdeš sa Centrom Gada i u naravnom periodu ja se nadam da ćemo uraditi drugi deo kišne kanalizacije koji je takođe nekde oko 1000 metara.

It is located 900 meters long, and is the most beautiful canalization. And then there is a well, where thousands of tons of asphalt are used. The leader of the public community of the municipality of Radov will finish these days the sidewalks, where the local legal relations are allowed, as well as the horizontal signalization. The value of the investment is 82.50 million, So, in this period, the final part remains only the trotters left on the right and right, and they will be solved by the fact that the imovic law is solved. The width of the street is 6.5 meters. As you can see, one of the important units that is connected to the center of the city. And in the next period, I hope that we will do another part of the rain channelization, which is also somewhere around 1000 meters. In the next year, the village of Erdeč will continue with the reconstruction of the neighborhood. In the upper part of the street, the partisan courier, who leads to the elementary school of the city of Bradović, will be connected to this village with the Baljkovic, which will be built on the river canalization and the asphalt, and the environment will be developed from the city budget."

Allora quelle pietre sono nel convento francescano di San Salvatore al Monte Alle Croci, Piazzale Michelangelo, posto meraviglioso da cui si vede tutta Firenze. Perché avete messo quell'altare lì sul Piazzale Michelangelo, Don Lorenzo? diciamo che il culmine è un po' dei nostri progetti, i progetti per la pace intera Santa in modo particolare nei territori occupati tramite Doreed e quindi una testimonianza di pace. Innanzitutto ricordando un personaggio che è stato un grande personaggio a Firenze che è Giorgio Lapira, Sindaco ma anche uno degli iniziatori di dialogo della pace in Medio Oriente. E quindi questo altare con queste pietre è San Salvador e Si parla anche del progetto Hollerland Radio comunque, eccolo qui. praticamente a causa della neve l'unico superstite è il Simone. Perché questi giovani attorno a te adesso? Perché il progetto è partito tutto il progetto dal 2000 fino a oggi è partito con i giovani con la scuola. Prima siamo partiti con l'Istitutotecchio Agrario e abbiamo lavorato 7-8 anni come progetto l'Istitutotecchio Agrario di Firenze. Poi ci siamo consigli di un'associazione perché i progetti con la scuola durano E' così. Vediamo di dare la nostra esperienza anche a loro. Qui si vede il laboratorio delle candele e poi tutti i vari laboratori.","And this is the altar of the peace we have just seen, practically made on... In fact, those two are two stones of 12 tons that come from Taiba. And where have you put these stones? And why? Those stones are in the Francescan Convent of San Salvador and the Monta Le Croce, the Michelangelo square, wonderful place from which you can see all Florence. Why did you put that altar there on the Michelangelo square, in Lorenzo? Let's say that the Coulmin is a bit of our projects. The projects for interesting peace, in particular in occupied territories through the Doread, and therefore a testimony of peace. First of all, remembering a character who was a great character in Florence, who is Giorgio Lapira, Sindaco, but also one of the initiators of the dialogue of the Middle East peace. And therefore this altar with these stones is San Salvador The first time we saw the Montelecroce because there was the commissioner of Terra Santa, the brother we collaborated with. The Altare is the culmination of our work, we saw the Torraet interview from the front to the Altare della Pace. Now there is a present and then a future, the one we saw from the escape. We are talking about the Holeyland Radio project. Holeyland Radio is a project that is moving forward, very interested in radio-vaticana. We see there a responsible Palermo, I think, of radio-vaticana. Only now should a boy from Italy come, who should become the director of the radio and then start for the broadcasts. Why are these young people around you now? Because the project has been going on since 2000, until today, with the young people. With the school. We started with the agrarian studio, and we worked on the project of the agrarian studio in Florence for 7-8 years. Then we gave them an association because the projects with the school It's not that hard. Since there were many projects, we had to give them a continuity. The work that has been done so far has been more than enough. The other is the Middle East. We already have contact with Father Isaac, whom you will talk about. From Lebanon.

The face of hunger is our neighbors, coworkers, friends and families. It is our children and our seniors. Across the Central Valley, more and more families are experiencing food insecurity and hunger as they struggle against unemployment, low paying jobs and rising food prices. Every day families are forced to make gut-wrenching between buying food and paying the rent, utilities, for gas to get to work, and for medicine. Each month, thousands of families in Fresno, Madera, and King's counties cannot afford well-balanced, nutritious meals. The implications are especially serious for children. Malnutrition can hinder a child's physical development and affect their ability to learn in school. We live in an era where some families must feed themselves on a diet. With the advent of fast food dollar menus and the skyrocketing costs of fresh fruits and vegetables at the grocery store, healthy food choices are a luxury that many families can no longer reach without the assistance of emergency food programs. Since 1992, Community Food Bank has been hard at work building and supporting partnerships to create a hunger-free Central Valley by working with over 130 partner agencies. we are able to efficiently acquire, store, and distribute food to nearly 90,000 people a week, delivering more than 30 million pounds of food per year. These partner agencies include food pantries, residential shelters, community kitchens, adult and child daycare centers, and many more. Community Food Bank is by far the single most important source of food for local nonprofit agencies. Many of these agencies would struggle to continue operating without the support of Community Food Bank. Community Food Bank also provides many much needed services for our region by managing various programs to help feed, educate and support those in need. These include the Food Bank Pantry Program, which acquires and distributes food to the hungry, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which distributes USDA provided commodities. The Nutritional Education Program, which provides information about healthy eating and lifestyles. The SNAP Outreach Program, which assists eligible individuals in obtaining consistent access to supplemental food. The Backpack Program, which sends kids home from school on the weekends with healthy and nutritious food for themselves and their families. And now, the Nutrition On Wheels Program. This special truck is equipped the stove, oven, refrigerator, and a nutritionist on board. Our mobile kitchen allows us to not only talk about eating healthy, but to also show people how to cook healthy and sample the food as it's prepared. Participants are given the recipes and ingredients in order to practice at home what they just learned through this fun presentation. Through community food banks, unique relationships, and vast network of food growers, distributors, and retailers, A $1 donation buys $8 worth of food or seven meals to be served to hungry families. Plus a full 96% of donations go directly to individuals and families in need. Community Food Bank is also a proud member of Feeding America, the nation's largest network of food banks. The organization provides rigorous standards and accountability for food handling, safety and product tracking, so you can be sure that your donations are being distributed safely and efficiently. The Central Valley is one of the most abundant agricultural regions in the world, producing a wealth of nutritious fruits and vegetables. Yet thousands of people are going hungry right here at our doorstep. As members of this community, we have a shared responsibility to address this serious problem. Community Food Bank needs individuals and organizations get involved and to support and expand its efforts to serve those in need. We have both corporate and community volunteer programs. Share your talents and skills by volunteering at our office, at the distribution center, or at one of our many events held throughout the year. Help Community Food Bank feed those in need by donating food. As individuals and businesses, you can host a food drive. If you're in the food industry, strongly consider that are donating your overstocked or short-dated food. You or your company can donate funds or sponsor a neighborhood market to help us continue distributing fresh produce to clients in need. You can also donate funds to help our nutrition education program continue delivering much needed food to children and seniors. Help raise awareness by spreading the word. Let people know that Community Food Bank is educating and involving the community to end hunger and alleviate malnutrition.

Feed hope because hunger is an everyday disaster.","The face of hunger is no longer just the homeless person standing on the corner or the working poor. The face of hunger is our neighbors, coworkers, friends and families. It is our children and our seniors. Across the Central Valley, more and more families are experiencing food insecurity and hunger as they struggle against unemployment, low-paying jobs and rising food prices. Every day families are forced to make gut-wrenching between buying food and paying the rent, utilities, for gas to get to work, and for medicine. Each month, thousands of families in Fresno, Madera, and King's counties cannot afford well-balanced nutritious meals. The implications are especially serious for children. Malnutrition can hinder a child's physical development and affect their ability to learn in school. We live in an era where some families must feed themselves on a daily basis. With the advent of fast food dollar menus and the skyrocketing costs of fresh fruits and vegetables at the grocery store, healthy food choices are a luxury that many families can no longer reach without the assistance of emergency food programs. Since 1992, Community Food Bank has been hard at work building and supporting partnerships to create a hunger-free Central Valley. By working with over 130 partner agencies, we are able to efficiently acquire, store, and distribute food to nearly 90,000 people a week, delivering more than 30 million pounds of food per year. These partner agencies include food pantries, residential shelters, community kitchens, adult and child daycare centers, and many more. Community Food Bank is by far the single most important source of food for local nonprofit agencies. Many of these agencies would struggle to continue operating without the support of Community Food Bank. Community Food Bank also provides many much needed services for our region by managing various programs to help feed, educate and support those in need. These include the Food Bank Pantry Program, which acquires and distributes food to the hungry, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which distributes USDA provided commodities. The Nutritional Education Program, which provides information about healthy eating and lifestyles. The SNAP Outreach Program, which assists eligible individuals in obtaining consistent access to supplemental food. The Backpack Program, which sends kids home from school on the weekends with healthy and nutritious food for themselves and their families. And now, the Nutrition On Wheels Program. This special truck is equipped the stove, oven, refrigerator, and a nutritionist on board. Our mobile kitchen allows us to not only talk about eating healthy, but to also show people how to cook healthy and sample the food as it's prepared. Participants are given the recipes and ingredients in order to practice at home what they just learned through this fun presentation. Through community food banks, unique relationships, and vast network of food growers, distributors, and retailers, A $1 donation buys $8 worth of food or seven meals to be served to hungry families. Plus a full 96% of donations go directly to individuals and families in need. Community Food Bank is also a proud member of Feeding America, the nation's largest network of food banks. The organization provides rigorous standards and accountability for food handling, safety and product tracking. so you can be sure that your donations are being distributed safely and efficiently. The Central Valley is one of the most abundant agricultural regions in the world, producing a wealth of nutritious fruits and vegetables. Yet thousands of people are going hungry right here at our doorstep. As members of this community, we have a shared responsibility to address this serious problem. Community Food Bank needs individuals and organizations get involved and to support and expand its efforts to serve those in need. We have both corporate and community volunteer programs. Share your talents and skills by volunteering at our office, at the distribution center, or at one of our many events held throughout the year. Help Community Food Bank feed those in need by donating food. As individuals and businesses, you can host a food drive. If you're in the food industry, strongly consider that are donating your overstocked or short-dated food. You or your company can donate funds or sponsor a neighborhood market to help us continue distributing fresh produce to clients in need. You can also donate funds to help our nutrition education program continue delivering much needed food to children and seniors. Help raise awareness by spreading the word. Let people know that Community Food Bank is educating and involving the community. to end hunger and alleviate malnutrition.

Em Amiciênes, eu vi que ali a comunicação era tudo que eu queria. Porque ia se encaixar Eu sempre tinha gostado da área de jornalismo, enfim, a área da comunicação sempre tinha curtido, mas não achava nada que se encaixasse muito com a área que eu trabalhava, que era desenvolvimento software. Descobrindo o curso de comunicação digital, eu vi que tudo passou a fazer mais sentido. Eu comecei a trabalhar várias outras áreas da comunicação. O curso também me abriu várias portas, eu comecei a desenvolver projetos meus e hoje estão enrodando. Mudei diária, mudei da Desvolnação de Software para comunicação e para o desenvolvimento web. Acho que a comunicação, para mim, foi essencial nesse ponto de dar um direcionamento profissional para uma coisa que eu gostasse mais de fazer.

Because it would fit I've always liked journalism, communication, but I didn't find it to fit the area I worked on, which was software development. Discovering the digital communication course, I saw that everything started to make more sense. I started working on several other areas of communication. The course also opened many doors for me. I started developing my projects, I'm now running around, I've changed my area, I've changed my software development to communicate and to the L development. I think communication was essential to me at that point, to give me a professional direction, for something that I would like to do more.

Entonces, cuando nosotros vimos esta información, también platicamos de eligito de Sergio, que lo regañaron aligito de Sergio o algo así, y que lo mandaron a trabajar a una carpintería. Entonces, nosotros tenemos, bueno, hay un chiste interno en el de cuando cada vez que hay helados o lo que sea, hay muchos vendedores en muchos lugares que dicen, nieves, nieves, nieves, nieves. Entonces, yo hice ese comentario nunca con el afán de corazón, lo digo, de ofender al hijo de Lupita, porque clasificó que no, si hay niños que han sufrido y que le han pasado mal en la vida son esos niños y lo único que hemos hecho es defendirlos, apapacharlos a todos. Hemos comentado siempre cosas lindas de ellos y que a pesar de todo son niños que han salido adelante y que han sabido responder de una manera positiva en la vida. Claro, pero para entender un poco más lo que está pasando porque yo tampoco lo vi y mucha gente tal vez tampoco lo vio. Vamos a ver qué fue lo que dijo la señora de Alessio el día de ayer en la oreja. yo, visto como te burlas y hablo de muchas artistas que te burlas de muchos de ellos también garilea que se burlas de muchas artistas con la oca, o sea quiero decir con palabras esta ocasión me pasó a mi hace poquito que también la oreja lo sacó pero la oreja de diferente manera bueno la oreja un poquito Yo me voy a Mexicali y me están hablando de mi gordura. Cuando mi gordura me dejó una enfermedad de la hipófisis, me dejó como 12 o 15 kilos arriba que no los he podido bajar desgraciadamente porque bueno el metabolismo ya cambia, ya es más difícil dieta que hagas, bajas muy poco. O sea yo lo que tengo que llegar a hacer es la hipoescultura, pero no quiero hablar de eso. Estoy hablando de que burlona esa niña tan bonita que era. Es otra persona completamente como de aligerar la situación y a parte de la verdad que lo tomes de esa manera porque no va por ahí y siempre te hemos respetado a pesar de todo de todo siempre te hemos respetado y te hemos echado por hemos tratado de apoyarla en todo y y Lupita nada más para dejarlo muy claro también a la oreja nosotros no somos un programa de chismes este es un programa de revista familiar trabajamos como ustedes lo pueden ver para toda la familia y nosotros en ningún momento tratamos de poner a la y que la asima Lupita y lo que sí, André me gustaría si podemos pasarle lo que nosotros dijimos.","We have it. Well, let's see. Do you think? Oh, no, we don't have it yet. So we're going to tell you that yesterday in the program Loreja there was a call by Mrs. Lupita D'Alessio, where she greets us, both Andrea and I, in the sense that, look, you know what I think? And the truth is, it's very sad to say it like that. I do feel very sad, I feel very ugly listening to talk. I think this is like a decomposed phone. Because really, she must have told something else. I'm not sure if it's true, but it's a joke that his son is working selling ice cream. When we saw this information, we talked about Sergio's choice, and they sent him to work on the carpentry. We have an internal joke, every time there are ice cream, there are many vendors in many places who say, snow, snow, snow, snow. I never said that in the comments, but I say it with the heart of my heart, to offend Lupita's son, Of course not. If there are children who have suffered and have had a bad time in life, they are those children. And the only thing we have done is to defend them, to encourage them, to everyone. We have always commented on beautiful things from them. And that despite everything, they are children who have come forward and who have been able to respond positively in life. Of course, but to understand a little more what is happening, because I did not see it either, and many people maybe did not see it either. Let's see what the lady of Alessio said yesterday in the ear. I'm going to address Andrea de Garetta. Andrea, I respect you and my family. I respect my children. I don't get involved with your children. And I'm much less a guerrilla because you don't have them. So you can talk to them. I was sitting there with a microphone. Andrea, don't get the right to get bored of my son who's working, rarely, for 18 years because I don't get involved with yours. You're sitting there, but you can't do anything else. I see how you get bored, and I talk about many artists, that get bored of many of them, also in Galilea, that get bored of many artists with the oka. I mean, with words, this occasion happened to me a little while ago, that the oka also took it out, but the oka in a different way, well, the oka a little. No, not much. Shut up. Shut up. So, I'm with a robot, I'm with a robot, I'm going to Mexico City and they're talking about my fatness. When my fatness, I got a disease of the hippo, and it left me like 12 or 15 kilos above, which I couldn't lower. Unfortunately, because the metabolism changes, it's harder, diet you do, you lower very little. I have to get to know the culture, but I don't want to talk about that. I'm talking about how dumb that pretty girl was. She's a completely different person. I'm asking you not to come back and get in my kids' shoes. I'll get your eyes off of you, Andrea. You too, Mr. Mayor. I think you should get back to work right now. I've sold ice cream and Galilea once told me, Andrea, my mom and my sister took a picture with you when you sold ice cream in a shopping mall. I sold clothes in a shopping mall in a shopping mall in the north of Mexico City. I've never felt like a person who has a child. On the contrary, I think it's very dignified and very nice. Here's a way to express my gratitude. I don't think it's true. I think it's very serious. The fact that I was threatened at a national level, I was surrounded by a 3 and a half year old girl, a year old girl and 8 months old girl, I was surrounded by my husband, my mother, my brother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, It's the audience's fault. It's a shame that a woman with a beautiful trajectory is wrong. They've made her fall into something that wasn't even right. Later on, we have the video of what we said yesterday in Oiseanora so you can judge if we agreed or not. But let's dance!"

En una investigación especial de la primera emisión de Noticias MVS, se señaló que el ""tráfico de influencias"" se puede observar en la rapidez con la que jueces del Distrito Federal -con los que Góngora Pimentel tendría una amistad- resolvieron encarcelar a la señora, quien previamente lo había denunciado por no otorgar una pensión alimenticia a sus hijos.  Los hijos del ministro, David y Ulises, padecen autismo, por lo que Orozco solicitó una pensión para ambos, lo cual inició un conflicto legal.  De acuerdo con el reportero de MVS, Juan Omar Fierro, Góngora Pimentel es de los jubilados mejor pagados, con un pago superior a 350 mil pesos mensuales. Sin embargo, al inicio ""le daba lo que quería"" a su expareja para los gastos de los niños, denunció el abogado.  Inicialmente, se había establecido una pensión de 35 por ciento del salario del exministro pero, según el abogado de la expareja, eso jamás se ejecutó porque Góngora apeló de inmediato; finalmente, se redujo la cantidad de pensión a 50 mil pesos mensuales.  En la denuncia de hechos, por lo que fue encarcelada la señora Orozco Castillo, se le imputa ""fraude genérico"" por no haber puesto a nombre de los niños una casa que pagó Góngora en Xochimilco. La madre de los pequeños indicó que lo hizo porque se trata de menores de edad.  Una jueza del DF ordenó la aprehensión de Ana María en mayo 2012; el 7 de junio fue ingresada a la cárcel de Santa Martha Acatitla.  Góngora Pimentel no accedió a dar su versión de los hechos.

In the case of this case, there are irregularities such as the seven days that he took to the criminal judge of the D.F. Nelly and Bon Cortez to order the arrest of Anamaria. There are also evidence that the minister in retirement has resorted to two employees who pay the maximum court of the country to fight against his ex-boyfriend. Thus, the contender of the Orozco Mary in demand for food pension, the accusation of penalty for fraud, the trial for custody of the minorities and the pre-abrogation for family violence is his ex-boyfriend and father of his children, Genaro Gongora Pimentel. and that same year they started an intimate relationship. Two years later, Ana María went to work at the Supreme Court directly in the office of Góngora, her partner. According to Article 47 of the Federal Law of Public Service Responsibilities, there is an express prohibition for employees to hire a agent with whom they have a personal or family relationship. Ana María took three positions, administrative secretary, and professional operation without performing any professional evaluation and with just one year of the licenciatura in plastic arts in May 2009 I was very worried about the behavior of his children so he went to the mental health center if you know me of the federal health secretary for his review after several months of study both were diagnosed with autism problems the grandmother of the minorities Margarita Castillo Baldovin, she says that her daughter Ana Maria, she came to the world above and gave up the court to have her children. Bongora opposed it, so there was a break in the couple. When she gives up, she talks to him to tell him that she has to give up, because they diagnosed, first they diagnosed the big one with autism, the other little one was born and they diagnosed him too. The big one has moderate autism. and the child has severe autism. It also has a kidney in the brain. They have done a lot of studies. They have seen them, they see them there, psychologists, psychiatrists. The youngest one also sees it in the child's psychiatric system, which is in the hospital area.

In December 2009, he handed her a check for the amount of two million three hundred the the district federal the amount of pension. and in the national university where he is a cathedrals that 35% never executed because immediately appealed to that self-administration and immediately went to one of the rooms of the Tribunal of Justice of the Federal District that car was revoked and the pension of the 35% pension of all its assets to a certain amount of 50,000 monthly pesos. The family maintains that the magician Juan Luis González has a deep friendship relationship with Gongora, so they assume a possible influence traffic. Brother Ana María Carlos Vasquez Castillo, assures that she herself concerted the dates between both lawyers. The problems for Ana María were recorded. On December 7, 2011, Góngora made a complaint against her ex-boyfriend for a fraud case in the purchase of the house she acquired two years ago. According to the capital search, she accused her children's mother of profit by naming her husband. of the incumplification of a more or less a crime contract. That is to say that it would be competent to know of that incumplification a civil judge, but not a criminal judge who has privacy and freedom. Carlos Vázquez Castillo adds that a sample of the partiality with which this trial is carried out are the differences that the judge Anelio Cortés and his staff have shown to the minister in retirement.

I'm making the final video it looks like to be the final video in my series analyzing the passion of of Jesus anything after this point is post resurrection appearances and Many people have written different works on analyzing the post resurrection Appearances and things like that. So Maybe in the future. I'll make videos on it. But for now since I promised to only deal with the passion I'll put the link in the description section to the video that comes before this. If you're just tuning in, I encourage you to watch all the way back to the first video in order so you can see what's going on here. We ended with Jesus being taken off of the cross in a previous video. Then, basically, the burial rites being done by Joseph of Armythia in the Gospel of John were told that Nicodemus as well was there to do this. the tomb. The thing is that Jesus was properly buried. I've heard some Christians argue that the women went there to give him a more proper burial. The thing is is that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus and all intents and purposes they gave him the They wrapped him up and they put him in the tomb. He was thus buried. The thing is that according to Jewish culture You're not supposed to go and dig someone up or go open up someone's grave after they've been in there for For already two or three days. That's not something that's done in Jewish culture The also according to Jewish culture. It's it's unheard of it's actually considered sinful for women in general to actually handle the bodies of the deceased but in Jewish culture you do not have people going in and Messing with people's bodies after they are actually dead so having established that the idea that they would go in there. In fact, I don't know of any culture the ones you're six feet under or in the case of Jesus in a plot in a tomb that you go in and start messing with their body and to anoint his dead body with oils is actually it's overkill and no pun intended because as we know earlier in the narrative Jesus when the unnamed woman anoints him he says that she has anointed him for his burial. So according to Jesus He says it himself, a woman had already anointed his body, but that's just something to consider. However, the thing is, is there anything in Jewish culture that we can point to that from the Talmud that tells us what these women were doing? What was their motive? If we go to Talmud and I'll post a link to my blog where I have replicated the article written by my Orthodox Jewish friend Mateo who wrote the article, props to him. We can find that according to the Jewish culture as outlined in the Talmud, we are told that it was customary to send out people into the cemeteries to see if someone was still alive. Because according to Jewish culture, there have been a number of cases where people were assumed to have been dead and then they were buried and then they ended up being alive. So it was Jewish practice to send people out into the cemeteries or to the graveyards to a grave and see if someone was still alive. And this is as close as we can get to actual real historical and cultural data here with which the Gospels are talking about. So the motive of these people was to go out and see if he was alive, implying that they didn't actually think that he was clinically dead when they did this. Just wanted to double check and make sure. According to Jewish culture as well, the idea, the fact remains that you were not considered clinically dead until the fourth day. The reason for this is that according to the Talmud, and again please see my references, according to the Talmud, days one, two, and three, your soul had a chance to reunite with the body. The soul was sitting next to the body and had a chance. It did not realize that it was separated quite yet and would attempt to get in, make these attempts to get back in, and thus someone could be alive. So it wasn't until the fourth day That you were considered clinically dead up until that point you were considered sleeping merely sleeping or in a metaphorical sense you were considered dead But you were not clinically dead as in you were not going to come back ever And so the idea is that you know for those of you out there who are still doubting the authenticity of the Talmud The question then remains is there anything in the New Testament to back up what I just said that the fourth day was considered That's it. You're not coming back. In fact there is if you go to chapter 11 of the gospel of John You'll see this is the the resurrection of Lazarus and we know that up until the point of starting around verse 9 through 16 you have Jesus telling his disciples that our friend Lazarus is asleep and They are viewing it just as Jews would be okay. Well, you know if he's asleep you can revive him can't you but then he has Jesus is saying after several the days have gone by our friend Lazarus is dead He's died indicating that no actually Lazarus is dead when they get to Martha Martha Verse 39 of chapter 11 says Jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him who is deceased said to him Lord, but now he smells for it is the fourth day that he is there so again an emphasis on the fourth day So again you have this idea that why is he messing with this that people are skeptical and may the people again invoke this idea you have this pattern of repeating the fourth day and as we know as I said according to Jewish culture that the fact remains that you are not clinically dead until the fourth day. Now Lazarus had been in there for four days. He was clinically dead, hence the skepticism. But yet the miracle was that Jesus still was able to bring him out. Bring him back from the dead, excuse me. So having established that, this is something you find in Scripture, we know also according to the Talmud, it invokes Hosea chapter 6 verse 2 where it says he will revive us after two days. He will raise this up on the third day that we may live before him. So in other words, you have this idea of again invoking scripture that insinuates that God and also others may have the power to bring you back even though you have only been in there for two or three days, going with the understanding according to Jewish culture, not clinically dead until the fourth. So having said all of that, the fact remains is this. Jesus Christ, according to the Gospels, was only in the grave for three days. So he did not even reach the fourth day where Jews would have, according to their culture and their theology would have considered him clinically dead. Hence that it is necessary to point out that his, that they never considered him to be clinically dead until if he had reached the fourth day. Hence people going out to his grave to see if he was still alive. Also, this makes perfect sense. sense why there's an absence in the book of Acts regarding putting a theological emphasis on Jesus's death and resurrection. The idea that this has some sort of theological connotation is virtually missing from the preaching of the Acts of the Apostles. It's mentioned. They say that you killed him and that God brought him back and things like this, but there's no emphasis on atonement for sin or things like this. There's no theological emphasis on this at all. It's almost like it's just a matter of fact. Paul of course emphasizes this but that's a totally different conversation but it's important to note that in the earliest writings that are allegedly put to the apostles we have the theological absence for his death and resurrection. According to the gospels of the Hebrews, Ebonites and such, the Jewish Christian sources that are dated at the first century, the brother of Jesus, James the just, is in an episode, is the first person to see the resurrected Jesus and Jesus says, Brother, I have returned from the land of those who are sleeping. Again, connotating the idea that before the fourth day you are merely sleeping, you are not actually clinically dead. So ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this series. I hope you enjoyed it to see the analysis of the passion, to see some of the interesting cultural and historical things that are sort of mishmashed in there. So thank you everyone for watching. Peace. Be with you all.","Hello everyone, this is Colin once again.

Here's what I've been working on here last week or so These walls 3d models obviously not the 2d. I'm used to doing They have bump mapping I hand painted them in Photoshop with my trusty way calm tablet and I think it turned out pretty good. I haven't really had any Texture scene problems with them or anything like that. So that's nice and here is the second wall type which goes to this tile set and it's more it's kind of like more of a pillar it has a specular map and a bump map also for it the you can sort of see some of the specular on some of the corners there the lights actually oriented above the player dummy there so it's not actually bouncing off the face of that dark band there also So these floor tiles I've been experimenting with 3D floor tiles. I don't know if that's the way to go yet or not. I mean these are the textures I want to use but depending on where the light source is sometimes you see noticeable seams. I mean even though the textures are lined up right, like you know like standing right here it doesn't look that like you can't see any. Except for this chunk here but that's because I've just seen what a big piece would look like. I don't know if a better bet would be to use a terrain object in Unity. tiles like these for a long damn time so Now I think I'm going to take it over to Photoshop and just show you the texture work by itself Textures yeah, okay. Here's the the first wall type This is an ounce of range on the final I actually paint them double the size of you know what they're supposed to be there's just be 512 by 512 So what 1024? Yeah, I think that's right man. Anyways, you know, I had a rough drawing which has been on the blog, concept art type deal. I modeled first and I of course take pictures of the models from the different sides or whatever and slap them down and start painting on top of them. Do the outline first. Then I start with the base color, which, there we go. I started putting highlights in the shadows and whatnot. I had even more highlights with not as sharp edges on more soft. I think I added in four just to give it a little more back texture to it so it wasn't as flat looking. Okay, here's the second wall type. I think I did a better job on this one since I kind of got back into the groove of it I guess. Oh yeah, here we go, this is cool. There's what I took from the 3D program. kind of a diagonal grain to it and then I copied that layer and I put some blur effects on it and made sure I deleted those from the sides there wouldn't be seams and all that stuff but there's a top part inside. Okay here's the floor tiles I'm working on. Floor tiles are a bitch at least for me I'm sure there's other people out there who can whip them up and lick and split whatever but It's a lot different when you're working with small graphics. There's not as many pixels yet to worry about when you're painting these big suckers like this You got a lot of room for things to go wrong Anyways what I first did was work out what kind of just Back around texture I wanted to have something that was tileable that would match up, you know if I turned it anyway, whatever That was the final one I think That was one I had before, but it left pretty bad real noticeable seams because when you're doing this for a game, you have to bring your coordinates inwards some because you have MIP maps and those are just incrementally smaller versions to save memory when you go through different distances. It tends to blur and you can lose your flow very quickly. very easily. fill in the rest of these blank spaces here. Which reminds me, I got a little blank space on the final versions of these two too, and I suppose we'll use them for any kind of rock debris brick-a-brack that would be present in the tile set. And the mine tile set, this goes to the mines. I think that's it with the Photoshop part. I may do some 3D bits here, Okay, just one last thing really quick I just wanted to show you the high poly versus the low poly version of this wall model the original I made was around 500 and some Polygon is really way too much. It's you know, it's kind of a tile item I mean Just way too much Jay pointed it out to me And give me some pointers on how to cut it down, you know swiftly and easily with this little hassle and with good results. But at the very least this helped me hash out the details for the actual texture. And I want to stop it here. Thanks for sitting through this. If you did, good grief. This is the longest one I've done. And I've been working on videos all day and I'm getting tired of these shits right now. So have a good weekend and I guess I'll probably do it again next weekend I suppose. Bye bye.","Yes, it's Friday time for some bull crap. Here's what I've been working on here last week or so these walls 3d models obviously not the 2d. I'm used to doing They have bump mapping I hand painted them in Photoshop with my trusty way calm tablet and I think it turned out pretty good. I haven't really had any Texture scene problems with them or anything like that. So that's nice and here is the second wall type which goes to this tile set and it's more it's kind of like more of a pillar it has a specular map and a bump map also for it the you can sort of see some of the specular on some of the corners there the lights actually oriented above the player dummy there so it's not actually bouncing off the face of that dark band there also So these floor tiles I've been experimenting with 3D floor tiles. I don't know if that's the way to go yet or not. I mean these are the textures I want to use. But depending on where the light source is, sometimes you see noticeable seams. I mean even though the textures are lined up right, like you know like standing right here it doesn't look that, like you can't see any. Except for this chunk here, but that's because I've just seen what a big piece would look like. I Tiles like these for a long damn time. So Now I think I'm going to take it over to Photoshop and just show you the texture work By itself Textures. Yeah, okay. Here's the the first wall type This is an ounce of range on the final I actually paint them double the size of you know what they're supposed to be there's just be 512 by 512 So what 1024? Yeah, I think that's right man. Anyways, you know, I first, well I had a rough drawing which has been on the blog, concept art type deal. And I modeled first and I, of course, take pictures of the models from the different sides or whatever and slap them down and start painting on top of them. Do the outline first. Then I start with the base color, which, there we go. Yeah, start with the base color down here. I started putting highlights in shadows and what not. I had even more highlights with not as sharp edges on more soft. I added in 4 just to give it a little more back texture to it so it wasn't flat looking. Here's the second wall type. I think I did a better job on this one since I got back into the groove of it. kind of a diagonal grain to it and then I copied that layer and I put some blur effects on it and made sure I deleted those from the sides there wouldn't be seams and all that stuff but there's a top part inside. Okay here's the floor tiles I'm working on. Floor tiles are a bitch at least for me I'm sure there's other people out there who can whip them up and lick and split whatever but It's a lot different when you're working with small graphics. There's not as many pixels yet to worry about when you're painting these big suckers like this You got a lot of room for things to go wrong Anyways what I first did was work out what kind of just Back around texture I wanted to have something that was tileable that would match up, you know if I turned it anyway, whatever That was the final one. I think That was one I had before but it left pretty bad real noticeable seams because when you're doing this for a game you have to bring your coordinates inwards some because you have MIP maps and those are just incrementally smaller versions to save memory when you go through different distances and it tends to blur and you can lose your flow very very fill in the rest of these blank spaces here. Which reminds me, I got a little blank space on the final versions of these two too, and I suppose we'll use them for any kind of rock debris brick-a-brack that would be present in the tile set. And the mine tile set, this goes to the mines. I think that's it with the Photoshop part. I may do some 3D bits here, Okay, just one last thing really quick I just wanted to show you the high poly versus the low poly version of this wall model the original I made was around 500 and some Polygon is really way too much. It's you know, it's kind of a tile item I mean Just way too much Jay pointed it out to me And give me some pointers on how to cut it down, you know swiftly and easily with this little hassle and with good results. I'm not sure what the difference is. But at the very least, this helped me hash out the details for the actual texture. And I want to stop it here. Thanks for sitting through this. If you did, good grief. This is the longest one I've done. And I've been working on videos all day and I'm getting tired of these shits right now. So have a good weekend. And I guess I'll probably do it again next weekend, I suppose. Bye-bye."

Este es el vídeo de las operaciones ejecutadas por parte de los equipos de posición propia para el trading room. La primera hipótesis se presenta por parte del team 7 en GLD, una formación en P en el marco de 10 minutos. El marco diario era un dubigap. Se opera esta primera formación en P con una entrada por los lados del 3981 y un stop en el 3965. La segunda hipótese se presenta por parte del team 12 en HD en el marco de 5 minutos. El precio en el marco diario es ubicado por debajo de boxes, boxes comprimidos en la parte superior y en el marco semanal se encontraba en zona de fluidez con posibilidades de ir a buscar. Primero, la parte superior del box anterior y una vez lo superé la zona de alto volumen a precio. Su vasta vendedor es igualmente en el marco de 60 minutos por debajo del punto de control. Er estaba algo extendido en movimiento algo profundo de ese retroceso para ese primer mínimo mayor se ejecuta por los lados del 33.65 con un stop por los lados del 33.58. En el comienzo se empieza a desarrollar bien la posición, aparecen nuevos boxes, el precio no se puede ubicar por encima del punto de control permanece siempre controlado por los vendedores hace un retroceso, rompe parte inferior del box y nos saca negativos de la posición. La siguiente hipótesis se plantea por parte del team 11 de nuevo un G y LD en el marco de cinco minutos se plantea una entrada al rompimiento de la parte inferior del box con un estrofo rodado del 40 16 se desarrolla bien el tray, era un tray algo agresivo, rompe parte inferior del box, aparece en nuevos boxes se ubica por debajo del punto de control del box que aparece se empieza a hacer una agerencia del total del lote con un tray el trailing esto finalmente el trailing esto se lleva por los lados del 3988 donde el equipo decide liquidar el 100% de la operación le iba a que aparece una vela en comparación a las anteriores era una vela de rango amplio luego de movimientos ya algo extendido en velas y es un trail que sale con el 100% del lote positivo la siguiente operación es planteada por parte del TIN 12 en orsl 5 minutos más formación en P, el precio se ubica por encima de Boxes, formación en P que se activa por los lados del 31.62 con un stop por los lados del 31.55 y en marco diario venía algo extendido, funciona muy bien el trade, llega un primer objetivo donde se liquida el 30% de la posición, en el segundo objetivo se liquida el 20% de la posición y se lleva un stop a este pivot por debajo de la parte inferior del box posteriormente el precio nos niega este movimiento y nos saca de la posición con el 50% restante. La siguiente hipótesis por parte del TIN 10 en F, 5 minutos, plantean una entrada a la estructura del punto de control con un stop por los lados del 12.96 en diario, ya el movimiento algo extendido mostrándonos más gente, se activa la entrada por los lados del 13.02 en el primer objetivo se liquida el 40% de la posición, llegamos a un objetivo se liquida el 40% restante de la posición con un trailing stop por acá por los lados de la parte superior de este box, el precio se devuelve y nos saca de la posición con el 20% restante. Bueno este fue el vídeo del trailing room con las operaciones ejecutadas por los equipos de posición propia, les habló Andrés Bermudez, nos vemos mañana.","Good afternoon, today is the 13th of June 2011, this is the video of the operations executed by the own position teams for the trading room The first hypothesis is presented by Team 7 in GLD, a formation in P in the 10 minutes mark. The daily mark was a dubigap, this first formation in P is operated with an entry from the 39 81 and the stop in the 39 65 The second hypothesis is presented by the team 12 in HD, 5 minutes mark The price in the daily brand is located below the boxes, boxes with first in the upper part and in the weekly brand was in the fluid zone with possibilities to go to look for first the upper part of the previous box and once it exceeds the high volume area at price, its sale rate is equally in the 60 minute brand below the control point. It was something extended in movement, something deep that process for The first major minibus is executed on the side of the 33.65 with a stop on the side of the 33.58. In the beginning the position begins to develop well, new boxes appear, the price cannot be located above the control point, always remains controlled by the sellers, makes a process, breaks lower part of the box and brings us negative from the position. The team 11 again G and LD in the 5 minute mark is placed at the bottom of the box with a stop on the sides of the 4016 the trade is developed, it is something aggressive break the bottom of the box, new boxes appear located below the control point of the box that appears The trailing stop is carried by 39.88 where the team decides to liquidate the 100% of the operation. A candle appears, in comparison to the previous ones, it was a wide range candle, then some movement, something extended in candles and it is a trail that comes out with 100% positive lot. The next operation is planned by the TIN12 in O.R.SL 5 minutes P-Formation, the price is located above Boxes, P-Formation that is activated by the side of the 31.62 with a stop by the side of the 31.55 and the daily mark has been extended, the trade works very well, it reaches a first objective where the 30% of the position is liquidated, in the second objective it is liquidated at 20% of the position and a stop is taken to this pivot below the bottom of the box, The price denies this movement and takes us out of the position with the remaining 50% The next hypothesis is by the TIN10 in F 5 minutes, they give a input the structure of the control point with a stop on the sides of 12.96 in the daily, already the movement extended showing more people, the input is activated on the sides of 13.02 in the first objective is liquid 40% of the position We have a goal, the remaining 40% of the position with a trailing stop on the top of this box, the price returns and we get the remaining 20% of the position. Well, this was the video of the trailing room with the operations executed by the own position teams, Andrés Bermudez, see you tomorrow."

During season, I guess I can say I prepare myself better by actually doing more strength type workouts. And I mean, it paid off, it helped a lot. I mean, I'm probably, I'm stronger than I ever been ever this season than I was last season. I know, especially since I dedicate myself more, you know, during the summertime. But besides that, I do a whole lot, a whole lot of work. of training on specific type muscles such as I mean of course my legs and shoulder work and stuff like that and that helped my bench go up which gave me more explosion and I mean besides that it's pretty much it. I feel like I'm in better condition shaping how I was this season than I was last year. Well have you been surprised by you know your first meet you won a couple of first place events and you've done well have you been surprised by the the hot start? Oh not really I was kind of disappointed because I mean last year I ended up last year pretty strong, especially in the shot put, but this year I want to actually try to get at least three feet further than what I do last year. I kind of got out to a cold start, in my opinion, because I know how strong I am and technique wise I've gotten better. But overall I feel good about the weight. I mean last year I ended in the weight at like 15 meters, but this year I PR maybe four feet, five feet better. So I would say that I'm satisfied with that, but I still got lot of work to do before championship.","All right, Lee talk to me a little bit about everything that we just talked about your workout and how it's helped you get off to such a good start Pretty much I just dedicated myself over the summer to get stronger and not not much is on mass But that's the end during system because with the throws a lot of a lot of what we do has to do with our legs being in shape So I basically took the time out to actually run more and actually do more do more workouts that I had more reps in it compared to a lot of mass and a lot of weight like I normally do.

For example, let's talk about a good one. For example, the new generation. We don't talk about other words. The new generation of the new generation. What does it mean? In fact, ancient people are very good. The first one is the wood. The second one is the axe. The new one is the axe. The axe is like this. Put it well. So what is the heart? It's always changing. It's called the heart. So we talk about the bride, that's wrong. How can I change it all the time? So the bride is always changing. So what is the heart? It's always changing. And we are not talking about the warm-hearted heart. Actually, this is all the same as what you know. I asked the student, also in your side, also a doctor, don't mention his name. He said, when we were warm-hearted, we used to save things. There will be new impressions or new gifts. I said, did you know that? Yes or no? You have new impressions every day. Then you, then you are, right? Isn't warm-hearted heart taught like this? You have to read it a few times every day, it's really good. If you read it again, it's different. Who dares to read it? This one looks like a Gui Shi Tang. Tomorrow, we'll see the Yellow-Horizon soup. Then, we'll see the White-Horizon soup. I said, this is the meaning. It's not. But we've been like this for decades. You haven't asked. I mean, this is the meaning. The meaning is like this. Put it in the chest, it's called warm. Put it here. Warm. Why do you want it to be warm? If you don't change anything, you won't be afraid. You will forget what you have saved. You won't be able to deal with what you have saved. You can't be a scholar. You won't be able to use your 300-year-old. You won't be able to use what you have saved. We have read a theory, and we will know it. I won't care about the future. I have saved and I won't forget. I can use this set of words. Otherwise, you will have to learn new things every day. So, you are wrong in our daily life. If you don't know the word, it's troublesome. What do you think of the word? The word of wisdom. There is a word in the I23 that we recently learned. This is the meaning of the word. The word is the word. I mean, the wisdom of Chinese people is like this. Why do we need wisdom? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need? What do we need?

So, I'm going to tell you about Chinese food. I hope you have a chance. When you're cooking noodles, you don't believe it. You take it out. You don't know it. You don't know it even once. There's a dish in Shanghai. Do you know what it is? What do you do? This dish doesn't even bother him. It doesn't. What does it do? It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb.

It's a bomb. It's a This is called the word, you can't understand it. This is the word, it's the same as the word of the soup. This is not the word. The word means fast and short. For example, if you do homework, you have to write this word. You can't write that homework. You can't do homework except for the three days you've done. You can do this homework. Because you have to write the word, you have to write the word. So you can't blame our teacher. Our teacher's teacher and our teacher's teacher's teacher. And our teacher's teacher's teacher's teacher's teacher. He said he didn't know. So you have to do this for a long time. So what kind of person are you? You can't just do that. What kind of person are you? You're going to die tomorrow. And the homework is below. Because it's not. The homework is below. No, no, no. It's not long. So the Chinese word is like this.

But those words that I mentioned, one of my first remarks about the committee and its final report saying it's time for the Bureau to get down to looking at espionage and terrorism and stop thinking about subversion and political ideas, that was very good for the Bureau and very good for the country. people even realize today and the kind of thing that couldn't continue to happen. Recently they got into KGB files and they found a file on Martin Luther King. They hated him because they thought Martin Luther King was a moderate who was diverting black America away from the Communist Revolution that they wanted them to.

And I think it shows that there were a lot of unwise use of those powers. I have one last question. Two things that drove our intelligence committee in those days was the red scare, anything that Russia did, we weren't accounting. And the other was the local unrest that was brought about principally at that time I guess by the Vietnam War. And these agencies were spying on the young people or anybody who would stand up and object to those wars. And those two things were very, very much involved. And to me, neither one of them had a whole lot to do with the security of this country. I never felt that there was really a red scare. I knew we were two powerful countries, two most powerful countries in the world. We had different philosophies. that the idea that we were going to fight each other, I don't think that was ever a possibility. I used to think, you know, if Russia and the United States would form a mutual defense pact, it'd kill ever Katniali. Nobody could attack either one of us forever.

Manifestazione di protesta contro le infiltrazioni della 'ndrangheta nel Magentino e per chiedere le dimissioni del sindaco  Alfredo Celeste agli arresti domiciliari con l'accusa di corruzione. Dalle intercettazioni risulta che il sindaco avrebbe cercato di favorire l'apertura di uno spazio commerciale all'imprenditore presunto boss della 'ndrangheta Eugenio Costantino, concesso in cambio di voti ricevuti o da ricevere. Celeste aveva inoltre invitato Eugenio Costantino, arrestato nell'operazione  della Procura di Milano, a una manifestazione da lui organizzata con la presenza di Nicole Minetti come madrina.  Il sindaco Celeste, ricostruiscono i pm nella richiesta di arresto, pregava Costantino di portare con sé un certo numero di persone per poter far fronte a eventuali contestatori, tenuto conto della ben nota vicenda che poco tempo prima aveva visto coinvolta la medesima Minetti. La cronista del settimanale Altomilanese Ester Castano spiega : Quella sera a maggio 2011 un centinaio di cittadini ha protestato contro la presenza della Minetti. Tra loro anche una suora e una maestra, strattonate da Marco Scalambra ( marito di Maria Stella Fagnani, consigliere comunale di Sedriano ) che ha obbligato la religiosa a salire sul palco per dare una parvenza cristiana all'evento su richiesta del sindaco Celeste.","'ndrangheta lombardia, nicole minetti, padania, sindaco sedriano, berlusconi, domenico zambetti, movimento giovani padani, corruzione, eugenio costantino, maria stella fagnani, alfredo celeste, silvio berlusconi, roberto maroni, maroni, lega, umberto bossi, ruby, marco scalambra, ester castano, lega nord, bossi, ndrangheta lombardia",2578,8,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/D87Q19WVT98.mp3,"Un piccolo corteo turba, l'apparente pace della festa del patrono di Sedriano, cintura milanese.

E in consiglio comunale ci sono anche i parenti dei due amici.

Everyone knows what they're talking about when talking about emissions. The Sindaco Alfredo Celeste is the housekeeper for having accepted financial support and votes in the electoral campaign of two friends arrested for a drangata. And in the council there are also the parents of the two friends. The wife of the friend Marco Scalambro, a powerful notable of the area Ora in Carcere, and the daughter of the friend Eugenio Costantino, the hairdresser of the Andrine, Ora in Carcere. Here the girl is presented to the 2009 communals, unless the Zambetti's assistant now in jail, in favor of the Eugenio's father on the ground. This is the video of the female serat of the religious sin of Celeste with the presence of Nicol Minetti, already inquisited by the Rubi case. The priest asks for help, intercepted by Constantino. Tomorrow I need your presence, he says, you know that Minetti is coming down and asks to bring friends, because the contest is waiting, but it ends equally badly. A Suora and a teacher are complaining about aggression. Esther Castano is a young journalist who, first, spoke in the high Milanese weekly of these men and for this she was threatened by Querelle and even challenged to approach the mayor. and the protesters. The mayor promised, according to the judges, that he would give him money and votes, without anyone hearing the smell of the Ndrangheta that emanated. It's too easy to suspect a strange person, maybe with a dome. I would suspect a person who smiles and gives him many hands."

They're probably trying to find me before I find them. But I got news for you. I will find them first. They're probably in disguise. They disguise as celebrities all the time. That's why you can never trust celebrities. Ever! That's why I never do. For example, one time one of them was disguised as Adam Lambert. That, that, you may all think is Adam. But it is not. I tell you it is not. It is one of them. They disguise themselves all the time. You can never be too careful when dealing with people like these. They can be anywhere. Any time at all. They disappear out of flashes. They're invisible. I mean, how can you ever deal with something like that? Maybe it's this teddy bear. This. This Tom bear. This isn't even mine, it's my sister's. Now, it is obvious that someone like me is very careful with this stuff. At the spy, I hide. I find what I need to know. I calculate information. I have a computer located on my wristband. I have CDs with plenty of secret information on them. CD with information. See? I go to all sorts of places all over the world trying to find them. I've been to Paris, Germany, Japan, France.

I hope you're well. In today's readings, firstly Exodus, we see Moses and Aaron, they go and they speak to Pharaoh. Pharaoh doesn't listen and so they try doing these signs that God had told them to do, to use, to try and convince him. That doesn't work. Pharaoh's magicians go out and they find ways to copy it, to do the same things. I don't quite know how. But that says to me that sometimes we can focus so much on how and why things happen and we find ways to do everything. As a human race, we like to think we're incredibly clever and there's nothing we can't do and that man can kind of conquer everything. Sometimes we can focus so much on trying to do that that we lose, if you like, the sense of wonder or we lose just the understanding that God is in control of everything. There's so much of it, it's freely available. You don't need to think much about water. And so then God takes that away. And they then either have to choose between drinking blood or dying. Sometimes if we take things for granted that are from God and we try and take God out of the picture and just assume that we can sort it ourselves, don't be surprised if that then gets taken away. Then we see a plague of frogs, not lions, not bears, not birds of prey, not anything big, not anything impressive or dangerous, but frogs. Note in this one that God can use the smallest things to punish. Nobody could get away from the frogs. They'd be in their beds, they'd be in their cupboards, wherever they went, when they went to sit in a corner, there would be frogs there. There was no way that was safe, if you like. There was no way that anyone could go to hide or to get away from the frogs. The priests were in trouble, they had to ensure that no vermin or anything like that was around or amongst them. The priests and their rules were under attack. This time the magicians couldn't copy it, they couldn't come up with their own version of this one. sooner or later, however hard we try, all of us have to admit that God is God and we can't match him or beat him. On into Matthew and today Jesus is talking about dead religion in the different parts of the passage today. And so firstly we see him having it out with the money changers and turning over the tables. And I think that's a warning that sometimes churches today can be more like businesses and churches. There can be so much going on in terms of selling merchandise and things like that. And a lot of churches look like they're just out to make money rather than to be a place of worship. We need to be careful about that. And then Jesus goes on and He heals the blind and the lame and there's children shouting praise. And the priests that were there didn't like it. It was against their tradition, it was against the regulations, it just wasn't the done thing. And again, there's a lot of that we see today as well. People aren't happy as soon as we step outside the box or we do things that aren't the done thing. People aren't happy. And yet there's a danger that if we just stay in the box, if we just stick to what's done because it's always been done, that we miss out on some of the purposes of God. And then we see Jesus walking along and he's hungry and he comes to a fig tree. Now picture or put yourself in the That's an area you're hungry, you're walking along and there's a fruit tree. And so you're looking forward to getting to the tree and finding fruit on it. That's exactly what Jesus wanted. And yet all he found when he got to this fruit tree was leaves. And in the same way, Israel was seen, if you like, as a vine or a vine was a symbol of Israel. And so if you like, Jesus has come to look for fruit in Israel and all his family his leaves. All he finds is rituals and just dead, dead religion, legalism. And then what we see is he destroys the tree. He doesn't find any fruit on it and so he puts his hand to it, he destroys it and the tree withers up completely. What he's saying is that there is no place in the kingdom of God for dead religion. Friends, enjoy your day and I'll see you tomorrow. God bless."

And its mission is to bring up global leaders in science and technology for humanity. We emphasize science technology, but we also emphasize humanity aspect in science and engineering education. We promote technology transfer to benefit the society. in terms of contributions by its graduates in industry. For example, at Samsung Electronic Company, 25% of its technical force are college graduates. Interdiscipline research in science and technology is of utmost importance. So we value interdisciplinary research very much at the college. One example is through the college institute on our campus. The institute is founded about six years ago to foster interdisciplinary research among the faculty members within KAIST and also outside members who are collaborators. By doing so, we can contribute to KAIST becoming more visible in the world-leading research. And the vision we have is OICU-RC Square, which is often innovation, interdisciplinary and integrated research, and creation through resilience. The institutes are very broad. However, I can focus on basically five key areas in the form of institutes within the KAIST Institute. These are the sort of key areas KAIST Institute are focusing on. But of course it involves open innovation. So a lot of more new fusion type research is coming in. KAIST students are very much engaged in these activities of KAIST Institute, not only as their thesis topic research, but also say for the formation of new venture companies out of this fusion research. They are creating very exciting education tool which will benefit many students. They are exploring their technology to overseas such as Mongolia and Arab nations. The first institution to develop human robots is the human lab. Human robot itself is kind of a big system. The system involves many different kind of aspects like its mechanical engineering and computer science and micro-programming and micro-processes. That kind of task is very, very important work for the engineering student because they learn practiced by practice in the college, but usually they do not have an experience of how it works together at the same time. The Hubo is a perfect example of such kind of big system. Industry in Korea benefits greatly from KAIST through its education and training of KAIST graduate students. KAIST is doing research on semiconductor devices. We do research on both the near-term solution for the needs of current semiconductor industries in Korea and also for future electronic devices which can overcome the limitation of current CMOS technology. From the early stage of KAIST, there has been very strong research groups for semiconductor devices. In fact, many Korean chin makers are kites to graduate, including current leaders of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Our students have a lot of experimental experience, and they have a lot of hand-on experience for the top-level research tools and production tools. So that's why they are very successful when they work in the industry. As a graded student, I have many chances to work with industries, especially those famous electronic industries. So it is a very good opportunity for me to work with them actually before going into the company. This nanofab center has many multi-million dollars equipment to fabricate devices that are really small and very skilled down to the utmost state-of-the-art technology. and also do lab work. So the courses you take, you will actually be able to see the stuff right in your lab the day after, maybe. So that's a really great opportunity. knowledge for the benefits of humankind and I think that's what the case is for."

I will break down your full forecast including your weekend forecast coming up again at six o'clock Pat. Alright that's right Paul and Pat. Take a look at this video that we just shot a little bit ago of Victorville in the street flooding that you can see. The flooding is about two to four inches from reports right now from the National Weather Service. As far as the amount of rain that came down in about an hour so far estimates at least one inch of rain from this very strong and powerful thunderstorms. So but is now moved off to the east and it is weakening so you can see it right there. Apple Valley, the whole area still dealing with some light shower activity, but the heaviest cell again continues to move off to the east. And this is been the pattern throughout the last few days.

So we do have flash flood watches in effect, not only in San Bernardino and Riverside, but also in the into the Antelope Valley and mountains of LA County until eight o'clock tonight. We also have another cell developing here. You can see right along the 79 to south of Beaumont and up into the Cabazon area. You can see another cell headed their way. I'll have more on this and the rest of that weekend forecast coming up. That's right, Rick. I was watching that very strong cell that was moving through the Victorville area.

Tiene la ampolla en cuartos y dentro posee un gas inercial, como lo es en que os. Para elegir adecuadamente la bombillería de su motocicleta, tengan cuenta los siguientes aspectos. Utilizemos el manual del usuario, el cual nos va a decir si nuestra bombillería es de 12 voltios, de 6 voltios, si el bombillero de faro es de 35 de 25 vatios, si la dirección al es de 10 de 5 vatios y con eso cada que lo reemplacemos vamos a poner el adecuado. Tratemos de comprar bombillería de buena calidad para evitar estar reemplazando los bombillos. Tenemos dos bombillos, uno de 35 vatios original y tenemos 1 de 35 vatios corriendo. Vamos a mirar la diferencia en consumo. El original consume 2 amperios. Veamos cuánto consume el genérico. Los consume 2.3, los pueden sobrecargar la instalación debido a que no tiene lo que especifica el fabricante. Hola amigos de Publimotor, estas son mis recomendaciones para hoy. En caso de que se parte algún protector de la bombilla, reemplacémoslo para evitar que el que se dañe por el contrato con el agua. Utilice el batillaje especificado por el fabricante, ese lo encontramos en el manual del propietario. Antes de salir en su motocicleta verifique que los dispositivos luminosos funcionen adecuadamente, evite este comparecimiento. En caso de daño excesivo en la bombillería, acuda a servicio técnico de confianza. por maca temotos poder a tu alcance","Technical advice arrives to you thanks to AKT. The pump can be classified in two ways Normal pump Which has bottles of Bible and does not have inner gas And allot of pump It has the pump in four and inside it has a gas and a gas as it is in the other To choose properly the pump of its motorcycle, take into account the following aspects We use the user manual, which will tell us if our 12 volt, 6 volt, 35 or 25 watt light bulb, if the address is 10, 5 watt and with that, each time we replace it, we will put the right one. We try to buy good quality bulb to avoid replacing the bulbs. We have two bulbs, one of 35 original, and we have one of 35 batteries running. We are going to look at the consumption difference. The original consumes two amps. Let's see how much the generic consumes. The consumption of 2.3 can overload the installation due to the fact that it does not have what the manufacturer specifies. that is damaged by contact with water. Use the batting specified by the manufacturer. We found it in the owner manual. Before leaving the motorcycle check that the luminous devices work properly. Avoid comparison. In case of excessive damage in the fire department, help the technical service of trust. All the inquiries that have please write to our email. Any inquiries we will solve.

We covered the C and the A. Our next letter is G. Again, we're deriving it from our open-focus G chord. Now this one, left-hand wise, is a little bit more demanding because it's quite stretched out. Your index finger would bar to the left of the nut. Your root is always on the sixth string with your third finger. If we need a C chord with that, we would go up to the eighth fret of the sixth string and this would be our C chord but with a G form. you would just see a G chord fingering. All right? Here's the C form. I'm going to link these together for you. Here's your C with a C form, the first letter of the word caged. Here's a C with the A form, the second letter of the word caged. Here's a C with the G form, the third letter of the word caged. Now I'm going to kind of cut to the chase here. You understand the format. You're going to have the charts. Anytime you have this D chord, you're going to have the G form chord, you can play various voicings out of that. I doubt if you're going to use this one too much. It's a bit demanding. That's a great thing to know in case you forget your capo and you're on a country gig. But anyway, here you have the arpeggio in this positional full range. One, three, five, one, three, five, one. We add the two and the six to that, we get major pentatonic. Six, one, two, three, five, six, one, two, three, five, six, one. That would be the six string root pentatonic. The six string Root Penetronic scale will always reside on top of your G form chord. I'd like to play over the C jam track then I'll change keys, I'll holler out what I'm doing. And I'm going to at this point start changing some positions to show you how after you've spent some time in one area, you're ready to move somewhere else. Because you know, if you don't slip and slide up the neck it starts to sound like a typewriter. There's my C chord. Now coming with little fills. I restrict myself just to the roots, thirds and fifths. Now I include the pentatonic scale. Now I gotta stress this right now. Most people learn pentatonic scale very, very early on in their career being a guitar player. And the problem with that is that you're not really starting on the ground on the foundation. That's why I'm a big advocate of you spending time and restricting yourself for several days or several weeks, whatever it takes. to just the roots, thirds and fifths. You'll be more melodic. You'll have strong punctuation points or periods at the ends of your phrases and you'll just sound better. You know, don't get caught up playing and not listening to what you're doing. If I'm playing over this C chord and I want some other areas, I have three areas now. I'll demonstrate. I just did the six string root pentatonic, which is oriented over this G form. Immediately to the left, of that I will always have the fifth string root A form with the third string root pentatonic. That way if I want to link those together that was a double pentatonic so. It's one way of visualizing what I'm doing. I've got two pentatonic back to back. They share a common border at straight line and the fifth fret and I have more fingerboard. I don't have tunnel vision where I'm just and four frets. The next pentatonic down the neck to the left would be the fifth ring root pentatonic which is oriented over the C chord. I've actually gone backwards in the word cage. I went G, A, C. Let's go forwards. Here's C, the A form and the G form. Let's change keys and see all that information in the key of E. I'll demonstrate it before I play along with the track. Here is an E chord with the C form. Here's an E chord with the A form, here's an E chord with the G form. So you see how we're covering a pretty good range of the fingerboard right here, the fourth through the 12th frets. Everything I just played came out of those three block forms and their associated pentatonic scale forms. Let's do it over G. G with a C form, G with the A form and G with a G form. Now since we're up at the 12th fret, it cycles around, so I'm back down here. g-corp with the g-form turns out I'm in open position, you see? So there's going to be a point where it will wrap around. It will depend what key you're in. In the next segment we'll finish off the remaining two letters of our caged system.","We've covered two of the letters of the word caged. We covered the C and the A. Our next letter is G. Again, we're deriving it from our open-focus G chord. Now this one, left-hand wise, is a little bit more demanding because it's quite stretched out. Your index finger would bar to the left of the nut. Your root is always on the sixth string with your third finger. If we need a C chord with that, we would go up to the eighth fret of the sixth string and this would be our C chord but with a G form. you would just see a G chord fingering. Alright? Here's the C form. I'm going to link these together for you. Here's your C with a C form, the first letter of the word caged. Here's a C with the A form, the second letter of the word caged. Here's a C with the G form, the third letter of the word caged. Now I'm going to kind of cut to the chase here. You understand the format. You're going to have the charts. Anytime you have this D chord, you're going to have the G form chord, you can play various voicings out of that. I doubt if you're going to use this one too much. It's a bit demanding. That's a great thing to know in case you forget your capo and you're on a country gig. But anyway, here you have the arpeggio in this positional full range. One, three, five, one, three, five, one. We add the two and the six to that. We get major pentatonic. Six, one, two, three, five, six, one, two, three, five, six, one. That would be the six string root pentatonic. The six string Root pentatonic scale will always reside on top of your G form chord. I'd like to play over the C jam track then I'll change keys, I'll holler out what I'm doing. And I'm going to at this point start changing some positions to show you how after you've spent some time in one area, you're ready to move somewhere else. Because you know, if you don't slip and slide up the neck it starts to sound like a typewriter. There's my C chord. Now coming with little fills. I restrict myself just to the roots, thirds and fifths. Now I include the pentatonic scale. Now I gotta stress this right now. Most people learn pentatonic scale very, very early on in their career being a guitar player. And the problem with that is that you're not really starting on the ground on the foundation. That's why I'm a big advocate of you spending time and restricting yourself for several days or several weeks, whatever it takes. to just the roots, thirds and fifths. You'll be more melodic. You'll have strong punctuation points or periods at the ends of your phrases and you'll just sound better. You know, don't get caught up playing and not listening to what you're doing. If I'm playing over this C chord and I want some other areas, I have three areas now. I'll demonstrate. I just did the six string root pentatonic, which is oriented over this G form. Immediately to the left, of that I will always have the fifth string root A form with the third string root pentatonic. That way if I want to link those together that was a double pentatonic so. It's one way of visualizing what I'm doing. I've got two pentatonic back to back. They share a common border at straight line and the fifth fret and I have more fingerboard. I don't have tunnel vision where I'm just and four frets. The next pentatonic down the neck to the left would be the fifth ring root pentatonic which is oriented over the C chord. I've actually gone backwards in the word cage. I went G, A, C. Let's go forwards. Here's C, the A form and the G form. Let's change keys and see all that information in the key of E. I'll demonstrate it before I play along with the track. Here is an E chord with the C form. Here's an E chord with the A form, here's an E chord with the G form. So you see how we're covering a pretty good range of the fingerboard right here, the fourth through the 12th fret. Everything I just played came out of those three block forms and their associated pentatonic scale forms. Let's do it over G. G with the C form, G with the A form and G with the G form. Now since we're up at the 12th fret, it cycles around so I'm back down here. g-corp with the g-form turns out I'm in open position, you see? So there's going to be a point where it will wrap around.

On our way to our first destination, our tourist guide, Forest, entertained the passengers. Ayon kay Forest. Daya sa talaga na yung ang kanyang work, medyo matagal na rin siyang tourist guide dito sa sanya. At dahil sa ito ang pinakatimugang bahagi ng China, maraming turista ang nagpupunta dito upang makita ang maliliit na isla arang South China Sea. Ayon sa Chinese literature, nasulat na sa maraming tula ang nasabi na isla. lugar gaya ng I will follow you to Chan Ya Hai Zhao. Pero ngayon, hindi lang ito para sa mga newlyweds o mga honeymooners dahil marangwere di itong mga pamilya ang nagbabonding. Very fun, very fun. Exciting. Bonding, bonding. Exciting. So, ala pa tayo sa giant rocks. So, minung ating tourist guide na meron giant rocks. So, very story ka do, ito sa mga Chinese. Pag-ababa sa tram ay exploring on foot naman. Ang ganda ng haba ng coastline niya na talagang white sands at makikita mo ang linis-linis ng tubig. So sana marami time ganyan sa Pilipinas. kasama rin sa mga group of rocks ang Southern Heaven Rock isang boulder na malapit sa Rock of Sun and Moon na may tulani fan yung tea sa ibabaw nito at ang Chania Cliff na may nakaukit na sulat ni Cheng He isang Chinese author. There's more to see as we head out the steps out of the ends of the earth. Next stop, Sanya Crystal. Isa sa mga natural resources at tourist attractions ng Sanya ay ang crystals nito. May ochre, black, purple, think at clear crystals. May nakayambed pa sa rock at may rungding super polished crystals na set sa jewelry, eyeglasses, and sculptures. Maraming pwede ngawin sa sanya crystals gaya na lang ng beadwork jewelry. Itinuturing ang sanya na isang getaway para sa mga taga Hong Kong kaya naman it's no wonder na marami na rin mga establishments ang itinatayo dito upang masuportahan ng growing to reason gaya na lang na mga hotel chains at restaurants. After lunch, travel time ulit Pupuntahan naman namin ang highest point sa buong saanya ang Luhui II o ang the deer turns its head. Isang malaking stone statue sa taas ng saanya harbor. Ularito ay makikita ang halos buong saanya. Breath taking talaga. It's past 3 pm and we're heading to the last leg of our saanya trip. Isang lugar na nagsushocase ng isarin sa mga prime products ng saanya. Ang coconut. Sa pagpasok palang sa building ay puro coconut products na ang makikita. Pwede ang coca na biscuit nila, dun sa kabila rin mo kaya niin. Saksang nilang ginagawa. Finally kung may pampasalubong kayo ay pwede rin iwi ang ibad ibang coco products dahil meron din coco na supermarket. kaya lang. Saya at hindi kami nakapagpapalit into Chinese R&B or R&MINB kaya hindi kami nakabali ng Pampasalubong sa next stop over na lang.

Do you want to get away with fast-paced living? Let's go to the southernmost tip of China to experience Sanya. We ate breakfast overlooking Sanya. We also went to our southern-onged city tour in the Hainan province of China. Sanya is known not only for its tropical climate but also for its venue for international beauty pageants. We have traveled to the previous tour bus. After a while, the bus was already on its way. Our first stop is the ends of the earth or the so-called Chinese, the edges of the heaven, chorus of the sea, a popular resort in the Hainan province. On our way to our first destination, our tourist guide, Forest, entertained the passengers. I'm very glad to be here because I can have a good chance to meet a lot of friends from all over the world. But now, it's not only for newlyweds or honeymooners because many families are bonding. This is the way to go. I'm walking ahead. The southern heaven rock is also a group of rocks. A boulder near the rock of sun and moon that has a fan-yunt on its top. And the chenya cliff that has a letter written by cheng he is a chinese author. There's more to see as we head out the steps out of the ends of the earth. Next stop, sanya crystal. One of the natural resources at tourist attractions of sanya is crystals. There's also a rock embedded in it. And there's also super polished crystals set in jewelry, eyeglasses, and sculptures. You can make a lot of them in Sania Christos, just like the beadwork jewelry. The Sania is also designed for a getaway for the Hong Kong people. So it's no wonder that there's a lot of establishments here to support the growing tourism, just like hotel chains and restaurants. We will now go to the highest point of Buong Sanya, Luhui 2 or the Deer Turns Its Head, a big stone statue at the top of Sanya Harbor. This is where you can see almost entire Sanya. It's breathtaking. It's past 3 p.m. and we're heading to the last leg of our Sanya trip. This is a place where you can showcase one of the prime products of Sanya, the coconut. The entrance to the building is full of coconut products that you can see. They also have coconut biscuits in the side. They are made in one place. Finally, if you have a snack, you can also buy other cocoa products because there is also a coconut supermarket. Hello everyone, I have ordered a 9.50 box of coconut biscuits. I often buy coconut biscuits. The first factory in the market is making coconut biscuits. I have a lot of them. It's like a barquillos. That's why... We can't replace the one hall in the set up of the supermarket. We can't replace it with Chinese R&B or Renminbi, so we can't buy a new one. We'll just stop here. It's been a long day and we're also going back to our home away from home, the StarCruisness Super Virgo. Even though we don't have a new one, we have many memories that will be shared with our family and friends."

Very common in Europe or in the English colonies. You'll see key. The passion behind this is kind of get that feel of the Mediterranean, the blue ocean, the feel of it, right? Exactly. We want people to have a very smooth, excellent vodka that's made by a master cognac distiller. And there are actually two vodkas that are blended together and they're blended to taste. I would think that it's a vodka that was designed as a fine sipping spirit. We tried to price it in an affordable range right around $30, depending on what market you're in. $30 bucks.

Stem op jouw favoriete doelpunt en maak kans op een cadeaubom te besteden in PSV Fanworld.","Hutchinson. By the men at Bovenberg. Hutchinson can go on like this. Yes, 2-1 for PSV. That's going fast. Raji, on the ball. Nice hook ball from Nicita. She's being sent off the road again. Nicita with the forehand. And on the new pass, Nore scores. PSV scores a 2-0 lead. Amiou stays down, Lenspoeper goes on. He doesn't have to step out of the ball. And... ...he shoots the ball in. Germany Lenz scores against a club, while his opponent is pleased. But the free kick from Stefan Neyland is important, and he shoots in brilliant. Hard over the wall, in the roof of the goal, DuLan does a bizarre chance and the stand is equal again. And so they see it in the end of the love. Lenz, in the case, Marne Leff. This is a good baccalaureate on the pitch, the first goal of PSV. The home club is in the 9th minute after a calm down. Vote for your favourite goal and make a chance to win a present in PSV Fan World."

The taste is more modern. The taste is more difficult. The frequency is about 30%. The current taste is about 30%. How did you design the style of the house? The background of the style is very important. Because the world is big, you need to go out and travel. So he hopes to come back home. It's a very peace feeling. It's like going home and then going to the night market. Like the place where the seal is, the design is more smooth, more matte, or more smooth. So it's like you designed the space for it to really relax. It's what it wants to achieve. I think the point is that the design in your space can be a good choice for the outdoor scenery. Yes, because it has just been mentioned that it wants to have the wind and the sun. We also have a guest dining and kitchen in the interior space. We can connect the kitchen to each other.

La chronique d'aujourd'hui porte sur les axes de rotation. Stéphane, je te pose une question. Je vais te demander de me donner la définition d'une rotation. C'est le mouvement du corps autour d'un axe? Oui, exactement. Le mouvement d'un corps autour d'un axe. Si je te pose une autre question, je te dis, au golf, est-ce que toi, dans ton élan, t'effectues ton élan sur un axe de rotation? Moi, oui. Oui? Oui. Tu peux me le montrer? Certainement. On va le montrer à tous, OK? Pour être sûr que... OK? Si on regarde bien, donc, si je définis ton axe, ça serait probablement l'axe de ta tête. Tu vas d'accord avec moi? Oui. La tête, l'épaule. Si on... On voit que c'est le centre ici. Donc le centre, est-ce que ton bas de corps a un appui au centre de ton corps? Non du tout, pas vraiment. Tu en as de chaque côté. Vous êtes d'accord avec moi? Oui. Quelles axes, on va les définir, c'est assez simple. C'est l'axe des épaules en rapport avec notre jambe, de chaque côté. Donc comme ça, on va être capable de réaliser dans notre élan de golf les deux axes de rotation. OK? OK. On va faire un tour de la route. On va faire un axe de rotation, comme tu le pensais, comme tout le monde le pense. sur les deux jambes ou directement sur la jambe go? Ça pourrait arriver que ce soit en avant. Mais rarement il va être là parce que le haut de ton corps n'est pas venu tourner, n'est pas venu effectuer l'axe, sa rotation vis-à-vis cette jambe-là. Donc on expliquait le fait que lorsque on fait notre rotation vers l'arrière, si on la fait au bon endroit donc sur la jambe droite, le poids du corps va nécessairement migrer avec la rotation. Tu es d'accord? Oui, je te suis. En même temps, on a pu expliquer le transfert de poids qui est un élément au golfe où la plupart des gens vont avoir tendance à se casser la tête avec le transfert de poids. Je me fais souvent poser la question. Oui, mais Christian, est-ce que je dois faire un transfert de poids? On vient de voir que le transfert de poids, il fait partie implicite du mouvement de golfe. Pourquoi? Parce que en tournant de la bonne façon, ok, on est capable de voir que le poids va se transférer. au départ vers la jambe arrière. Puis là, on va bien le voir. Je vais le démontrer. On va bien regarder vers l'arrière. Donc ton poids est ici. On a arrêté le swing. On sait que c'est l'axe des jambes. Donc, au retour vers la balle, tu vas aller effectuer ta rotation sur la jambe gauche. Et ton bâton va naturellement continuer vers ta finition. mon poids de corps se déplace vers la jambe gauche? sur la rotation arrière, avec les mouvements de retour vers la balle, facilement, le poids du corps va migrer vers la jambe. OK, vers la jambe avant, qu'on va appeler la jambe gauche. Je vais te proposer un petit exercice. J'ai un instrument d'enseignement, OK, un éducatif assez simple qui nous permet de voir si tu exécutes bien l'axe de rotation, surtout l'axe arrière. Ça va nous donner une bonne idée. OK? le place au sol. Et d'un côté, on voit bien, il y a jaune de ce côté ici, rouge de ce côté ici. OK, comme ça. Donc lorsque tu vas t'installer sur la balle, on va voir que si je te demande quelle couleur tu vois. Moi, je vois le jaune. Parfait. Tu vois le jaune. Donc je vais te demander d'exécuter ton aile arrière sur l'axe de l'aile arrière. Quelle couleur tu vois, Stéphane? Notre petit... Là, je vois du rouge. Tu vois du rouge? Le jaune est complètement Donc c'est simple que tu migris vers ton axe de rotation arrière, ce qui est l'élément le plus important. Si on le faisait, exemple, sans migrer vers l'arrière, mais sur l'axe définie que tout le monde pense... Sur un axe seulement. Sur un axe. Quel couleur tu vois, Stéphane? Jaune. Tu vois encore juste du jaune. OK. Ça fait que c'est là, peut-être bien important, c'est que la tête ne reste pas sur la balle. Donc quand... de la belle. C'est vraiment une partie de ton corps important. Donc, à ce moment-là, il peut avoir certains problèmes lorsqu'il va revenir vers la barre. Donc, le seul élément fixe, c'est la vision. La tête est en mouvement dans la rotation de l'élan. Tu peux le refaire encore, Stéphane, par rapport à un élan dans l'ensemble. Si on fait l'élan dans l'ensemble. Dans l'ensemble, un élan sans arrêt. Je suis là, te demandant encore de regarder le jeu. et après ça, puis tu me diras après si tu as vu le rouge. Et voilà. Est-ce que tu as vu le rouge? Oui, j'ai vu le rouge rendu ici, là. Mais visions, on était dans le rouge. Donc on a été capables, en terminant, d'expliquer deux phénomènes. Ce qui amène le transfert du poids au golfe, c'est bien l'exécution de Léland sur deux axes de retesse. Alors, pratiquez ça.","Golf Academy, you are presented by the Golf Club of Albatross, for quality golf, everything is near you, and by signature Maurice Tanguay, so much difference and elegance. Today's topic is rotation axes. Stefan, I ask you a question. I will ask you to define a rotation. Well, it's the movement of the body around an axis. Yes, exactly, the movement of a body around an axis. Here, I ask you another question. I tell you, in the Gulf, do you, in your island, do your island on a rotation axis? Me, yes. Yes? Yes. Can you show me? Certainly. We will show it to everyone. Okay? To be sure that... Okay? If we look closely, so if I define your axis, it would probably be the axis of your head. Do you agree with me? Yes. The head, the shoulder. If we go along So the center, is your bottom of the body supported by the center of your body? No, not really. You have it on each side. Okay, with me. Yes. The axes, we will define them, it's quite simple. It's the shoulder axes in relation with our leg, on each side. So like that, we will be able to realize in our golf course the two rotation axes. Okay? Okay. We will do the rotation axes, The back axis. We'll see it. Good rotation. Look. Head, shoulder, leg. We see. So like this. What happens if I ask you an example? Where is the weight of your body? The floor. Okay, we repeat. We're going to do a rotation axis. As you thought it and as everyone thinks. The weight of your body and where? It's separated. or directly on the right leg. It could happen that it is before, but rarely it will be there because the top of your body has not come to turn, it has not come to perform the axis, its rotation, face to face, this leg. So we explained the fact that when we do our rotation backwards, if we do it in the right leg, so on the right leg, the weight of the body will necessarily migrate with the rotation. You agree? Yes, I follow you. At the same time, we could explain the transfer of weight, which is an element to the crazy goal. Most people tend to break their heads with the transfer of weight. I often get asked this question. Yes, Christian, do I have to do a transfer of weight? We just saw that the transfer of weight is part of the implicit movement of the goal. Why? Because by turning in the right direction, we are able to see that the weight is going to transfer. and then we will see it well. I will show it. We will look closely. We will look back. We will move back. So your weight is here. We will stop the swing. The axis, we know that it is the axis of the legs. So we go back to the ball. You will go to rotate on the left leg. And your bar will naturally continue to your finish. So like that, you will have a good feeling. My body is moving to the left. Yes. And it's there. And at the same time, it's all the body that is going to move to the left. Because it creates a lot of speed, like that. The fact that the concrete travels quickly and that the waves of the ice are hard. A very short time, a second, a second and a half. So the weight travels quickly. But the key, what is important to remember is that the key is the axis of rotation backwards. If we have a good axis of rotation, we have a good axis of rotation. with the movement of the back rotation, with the movement of the back rotation to the ball, the weight of the body will move to the leg. To the leg forward, we will call the leg left. I will propose you a little exercise. I have an instrument in the teaching, a very simple educational one, which allows us to see if you execute the rotation axis well, especially the rear axis. It will give us a good idea. So when you're going to install yourself on the ball, we'll see that if I ask you what color you see, I see the yellow. Perfect. You see the yellow, so I'm going to ask you to execute your back arrow on the axis of the back arrow. What color do you see, Stefan? Our little... I see the red. You see the red? The yellow is completely black. So it's that you migrate to your rear rotation axis, which is the most important element. If we do it for example, without moving backwards, but on the axis defined that everyone thinks... On an axis, only. On an axis. What color do you see, Stéphane? Yellow. You still see just the yellow. So what's important is that the head doesn't stay on the ball, but the eyes, which stay on the ball. Exactly. It's a good point, very confused by the majority of the golfers. The only static element is the vision. We have to look at the ball, that's for sure. But in all this, we are capable of slightly moving our head or letting it go with the movement of the body, which allows us to develop what we have said so far regarding ease and ease. If we want to be able to do it, If you do it together, you can do it without stopping. and then you'll tell me afterwards if you saw the red. And that's it. Because you saw the red? Yes, I saw the red, I went here, but here we were in the red. So we were able, by explaining two phenomena, which brings the transfer of weight to the golf course, it's good, the execution of the lats on two axes of rotation. So, practice that."

Online, TV and wherever possible, the print area. China's enormous potential for growth in various media branches is certainly the industry experts. At the same time, the country is setting standards for many media companies because of a challenge. China is always very strongly regulated. If you want to publish a newspaper, you still consider it very strong. The government is not allowed to be the only owner of a media company. We are not very involved in the professional sector. The sense of censorship is not as bad as in the political sector. But it is still the case that they are delivered to the press offices. I would say that for the media companies that have done their homework, which are already far away from developing digital offers, understanding of the end customers, collecting data and using it in the right way, only these companies that have done their homework will be successful at internationalisation. and the internationalisation in the media will continue to be a part of the journey.

Así es Lizzie y tenemos bueno otra vez al otro lado del estudio al profesor Ruben Abarro Vargas y al maestro Jorge González Arce que nos darán las conclusiones de este tema interesantísimo. Acompáñanos. Muy bien, muy bien pues el programa ha estado de maravilla realmente estamos muy entretenidos porque la diversión ante todo debe ser entretenimiento y diversión el tema pues es y estamos platicando antes de irnos a este corte musical con Leiden que realmente me ha sorprendido por esa frescura que tiene su voz y por su calidad pues de composición. Platicamos antes de irnos precisamente acerca del trabajo de Magú y Magú este monero cuya estética realmente me sorprende porque si bien la caricatura tiene esa cualidad de exagerar los rasgos de los de los personajes políticos o no políticos creo que Magú realmente exageró en esa situación, ¿No querés así Jorge González Arce? Bueno sí, este el estilo de Magú, este, diciéndolo de una manera elegante, podemos decir que es una estética feista, ¿No? Y bueno, de otra forma que que bueno, hay quien ve los dibujos dice pues, dibuja feo, ¿No? Son sus dibujos son feos, o sea, porque bueno su estética es así, ¿No? Hay quien decía también Moneros de broma que que a la mejor tenían problema en la vista, por eso dibujaba así, es un poco como los Daltonicos, que pueden hacer combinaciones de colores maravillosas, porque no están viendo los colores tal como los vemos todos, pero bueno, el mérito de Magú es que uno ve las caricaturas en especial de los personajes y les haya un tremendo parecido, esa cualidad, ver hacer con ese dibujo, la equivalencia, porque no es un retrato figurativo totalmente, sino que es equivalente y muchas veces es mucho más poderoso un dibujo así, equivalente con la fiandada hacia la realidad que uno muy estéticamente logrado. Pues esa cualidad estética no la había escuchado, feista, horripilante, pero no solamente debe ser bello, la estética no solamente de la estética. Debe de ser bella. Un amigo mío decía cuando le preguntábamos sobre la estética dice ah es el lugar donde se corta de pelo la gente ¿No? Ajá. Pero no, la estética tiene y puede ser fea, hermosa, horripilante, pues es una cualidad muy especial que tiene los dibujos de Magú, está, está a usted de acuerdo con nosotros en este momento que estamos pues pasando a algunos de sus eh pues principales eh manifestaciones que Magú es realmente muy especial. ¿Qué otra cosa podríamos destacar de este caricaturista maestro Jorge González Arce? Bueno, aparte de su estética pues los contenidos, que también es algo el humor que tiene, es muy especial, que también tiene esa virtud que tienen otros monedos políticos de saber este retratar y la realidad y de hacernos conciencia de lo que está pasando a nuestro alrededor. y bueno, este yo creo que hacía el trabajo de mago es es muy completo, no? Enfocarnos en el dibujo pues es lo más este lo lo que más alta la vista, ¿No? Pero todo lo demás es todo un complemento que lo hace ser un autorno y muy completo, ¿No? Este caricaturizo este monero de Jalisco de los altos de Jalisco justamente de este lugar que está pegadito a San Miguel, ¿No? Y que donde pues se dice yo no sé si usted que se conoce por allá que están las mujeres más hermosas de Jalisco, ¿tás de acuerdo? Sí. Sí. Claro. Hay que hay que ir ahí. Bueno, sin agraviar a todas las delcuad, porque también en el cuad están unas de las mujeres más hermosas de Jalisco, tienen nada más que venir a a verlas este e inteligentes también. Inteligentes, de hecho, ese es un autorio, ¿no? Este yo acabo de estar en el en el distrito federal y y moneros de allá me decían que Sí, algo que les gustaba de acá es que veían que para donde volteaban veían mujeres bonitas. Sí, es verdad. Y bueno, estaba uno con su novia y yo le digo, bueno, en México también hay mujeres muy bonitas. No sé, no sé, no sé, no sé, esto no es de aquí. Ah, bueno, entonces ellas son más bonitas. Sí, o sea, aquí pues esa, esa, esa, esa ventaja tenemos. Sí, y más en los altos de Jalisco. Bien, pues yo les recomiendo a todos ustedes que además de visitar los altos de Jalisco pues sabés visiten la feria internacional de Libro, una de las ferias más importantes de este continente y de bueno de todos los continentes de habla hispana. Hace rato que los alumnos te preguntaban con respecto a la parte intelectual de los dibujos. Yo creo que hay una característica muy especial que debe tener un monero, no sé si te vas de acuerdo conmigo, que es precisamente su capacidad de tener vivencias y esas vivencias que se forman después en anécdotas, que las puedan que están llevando y se intentan en sus dibujos. Una persona que no tiene vivencias, difícilmente podrá tener esa materia prima para poder expresar, al menos como lo hacen los monedos en México. Sí, tienen que tener vivencias, produce lo que vive, también tienen que tener mucha cultura, tienen que conocer mucho y estar al tanto de la realidad, no estar muy bien informado. de los moneros con los que convivió pues es gente como muy intelectual, no? Como que la feria del libro les queda muy bien. O sea, como que es gente que le gusta y con mucho sentido del humor también. El humor que no hay que olvidarnos. Los mexicanos tenemos un sentido del humor pero exacerbado y tenemos que estar permanentemente ejercitando, lo contando chistes, criticando de una manera cómica a los personajes, porque es parte de nuestra identidad como mexicanos, yo no entiendo al mexicano, a la mexicana si es muy serio, si es muy europeo, porque los mexicanos somos así abiertos, francos, reesueños. Sí, reírnos de todo y bueno, también de lo que nos duele, no es como la frase del fisco, no, que solo, solo me duele, solo me río cuando me duele, no. Porque, grosado de saberse, pues muchísimas gracias por estar aquí en Vivecuar. Gracias. Realmente queremos decirte que es uno de los maestros, de los académicos más activos y por eso este programa ha puesto sus ojos en ti, porque pues eres una de las personas que más orgullo nos da tener como compañeros en este centro universitario. Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias. Regresamos en Vivecuad, el centro universitario de arte, arquitectura y diseño.","And well, we are back here in this program, Vive Cuaz full of music and a lot of fun. That's right, Lizzie. And we have, well, again on the other side of the studio, Professor Rubén Abarro Vargas and Master Jorge González Arce, who will give us the conclusions of this very interesting topic. Join us. Very good, very good. Well, the program has been wonderful. We are really very entertained because the fun, first of all, must be entertainment and fun. The theme is interesting. We are talking about this musical court with Leiden, who has really surprised me by the freshness of his voice and his composition. We are talking about Magu's work. Magu is a coin whose aesthetic surprises me, because although the caricature has the quality of exaggerating the features of the people, political or non-political characters, I think that Magú really exaggerated in this situation, don't you think so, Jorge González Arce? Well, yes, the style of Magú, saying it in an elegant way, we can say that it is a feisty aesthetic. And well, in another way, there is someone who sees the drawings and says, well, he draws ugly, his drawings are ugly, well, his aesthetic is like that, there is someone who also said, also, money, joke, that that maybe they had a problem in their eyes, that's why they drew it like that. It's a bit like the Daltonicos, they can make wonderful combinations of colors, because they're not seeing the colors as we all see them. But the merit of Magoo is that you see the caricatures, especially the characters, and they have a tremendous resemblance. That quality, to do with that drawing the equivalence, because it is not a figurative portrait, but rather it is equivalent and many times it is much more powerful a drawing like that, equivalent to the reality that one very aesthetically achieved. Well, that aesthetic quality I had not heard it, very ugly or repellent, but not only it must be beautiful, the aesthetic not only It must be beautiful. A friend of mine said when we asked about aesthetics, he said, it's the place where the hair is cut, the hair is cut, but no, aesthetics can be ugly, beautiful, horrible. It's a very special quality that Magú's drawings have. It's in accordance with us. At this moment we are passing on some of his main manifestations, which Magú is really very special. What other things could we highlight from this cartoonist, teacher Jorge González Arce? Well, apart from his aesthetics, the contents, which is also something, the humor that has, the humor that has, it is very special, that it also has that virtue that other political monies have, of knowing this portrait and the reality and making us aware of what is happening, right? I think that the work of Magüez is very complete. Focus on the drawing is the highest thing in the world, but everything else is a compliment that makes him a very complete author. This caricaturist or this moneymaker of Jalisco, of the high-class of Jalisco, precisely in this place that is attached to San Miguel, where he says, I don't know if you know, I know that there are the most beautiful women in Jalisco, do you agree? Yes, of course. Well, without aggravating all those of El Cuat, because also in El Cuat are one of the most beautiful women in Jalisco, they just have to come to see them, and they are smart too. Intelligent, in fact, that's notorium, I just happened to be in the federal district and money, they already told me that. Yes, something that they liked about it is that they saw beautiful women wherever they went. Yes, that's true. And well, there was one with his girlfriend and I told her, well, in Mexico there are also very beautiful women, I don't know what they said. No, I don't know, they're not stupid here. Oh, well, then they are more beautiful. Yes, that advantage we have. And more in the highlands of Jalisco. Well, I recommend to all of you that, in addition to visiting the highlands of Jalisco, you know, visit the International Book Fair, one of the most important fairs in this continent, and of all the continents of the Spanish Abla. I have to make sure that the students ask you about the intellectual part of the drawings. I think there is a very special characteristic that a black-headed man should have, I do not know if you agree with me, which is precisely his ability to have experiences, and those experiences that are formed later in anecdotes that can and to try to get into their drawings. A person who doesn't have a living, it's hard to have that raw material to express at least how the money are made in Mexico. Yes, they do have to have living, they produce what they live, they also have to have a lot of culture, they have to know a lot, and to be aware of the reality, not to be very well informed. The humor that we must not forget, we Mexicans have a sense of humor but exacerbated and we must be constantly exercising, telling jokes, criticizing in a comic way the characters because it is part of the humor that we have to be able to express. I don't understand if Mexican is very serious, if it's very European, because Mexicans are like this, open, frank, dreamy. Yes, to laugh at everything and also what hurts us, it's like the phrase of the Fisbo, that it only hurts me when it hurts me. Jorge, thank you very much for being here in Vivecuar. Thank you very much. We really want to say that to be one of the most active teachers and academics, and that's why this program has put your eyes on you, because you are one of the people that makes us proud to have you as a partner in this Center Universitario. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We return to Vivecuar del Centro Universitario de Arte, Architecture and Design."

Ebben a részben az értelmezési tartományokkal fogunk foglákozni. Mi is az az értelmezési tartomány erőször ezt tisztazzuk? Elhez arra kell emlékezni, hogy mi az, hogy algebbraiki fejezés. Persze én itt most emlom a definícióra gondolok, hanem arra, hogy ez tulajdonképpen, hogy működik. Amikor ezt tanítják általában, mint egy gép szokták, vizuálizáni az algebbraiki fejezést. valamilyen számot ez a gép egy szabály szerint csinál valamit ezzel a számbal majd kidobj egy másik számat jelenesetben egy bedoptuk a 2-es kidobja az 5-est pedobunk egy másik számat a 3-es kidobj másik számat a 10-est pedobunk még egy 3-egyszámat a 4-est kidobj még egyet az a 17-es ezt a gépet matematikai jölagba kevetkező képen írják ez az x4z plusz egy algebbrai kifejezés matak nyelvén szóval A két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök a két tűnök hogy ha egébben a gépben a nulát dobjuk. Elkezd. Cserögni, kattogni, összevisszarezegnéz a gép, a próbálja az egyben nulát kiszámolni. Aztán szépen felszállnak az első fűsgómajogók, majd félrobban a gép. Miért is? Mert nulával nem lehet hozteni. Ha kép akár, hogy akarja kiszámolni, ez nem fog megni. Tehát, vannak olyan esetek, amikor a bizonyos számokkal az az algebbraig kifejezés, hogy művelet nem végezhetően. De kis lehetnek ezek. Ilyen esetek például a törták, hogy már itt is pedzegettünk, hogy a nulával nem lehet oztani. Ezért, hogyha egy olyan kifejezés látunk, ahol egy számláló, van szereplő algebbrai kifejezés van elosztva, egy nevezőben lévő algebbrai kifejezéssel, akkor azt kell mondani, hogy az, ami a nevezőben van, az nem lehet nulá. Mert nulával nem lehet oztani. Úgyanis négyzett gyöket nem lehet akármi ből vonni. Nézzük meg ezt. Tehogy itt kipróbáljuk, hogy az X-éve beérjük azt, hogy egy, akkor azt kapi, hogy egyből a kettő ami minus egy, már pedig a valószállamok között minus egynek nincsen négyzett gyöket. Az kell mondanunk, hogy itt az X-nek legalább kettőnek kell lenni, ahhoz, hogy ez a gép működjön és valami értelmes eredmény tagjon. Akkor nulánk kapunk, nulánapedik van gyök el, maga a nula. Ez persze akkor is úgy van, hogyha nem nézzed gyökről van szóha nem negyedik gyökről, hiszen pár rossz gyököt csak pozitív számokba lehet van. Tehát 6 esetén és 8 esetén is pár milyen pár rossz gyököt vonunk, ennek teljesülni kell ahhoz, hogy ez az idészőjeles gép egy értelmes eredményt adjam. Nézzük meg mi van pár atlan gyökökkel. Veldául a 3 négy gyök alatt x plus 6-an. az, hogy a harmlégyök hogyan működik. Van még tovább bőn esetek, ahol gond lehet az értelmezési tartomanyal ilyen például a logaritmus. Ha valahogy logaritmusos kifejezés, állapulogaritmus bém, akkor itt már sállós két szabályt is me kell jelzni, egyrészt az ára, hogy ő nagyobb legyen nulla, minnulla, és ne legyen egy, és a bírem is me kell jelzni, hogy a bé legyen nagyobb minnulla. Itt az egyelőségek nem megengedettek. Meglegerább két dolgra van szükség ahhoz, hogy összekeverhesse őket, sőt ez a kettő általban elég is ahhoz, hogy összekeverj őket. Ezértnek az embereknek van egy jó hírem. Ezt nem kell megtanulni. A következőt elegedé megtanulni. Ezt a számot. Már hogy ezen az oldalon ez mind-mind-mind levon írva a négyegyű fűgvén táblában. Szépen, hogy milyen lehet az X, milyen lehet az A. Éppen az az azot esetekben milyen értékeket velehet megföl. a gyökkonás esetén is elegedő ezt a számot megegyézni, mert hogy az enedik gyök nél is le van írva, hogy mikor milyen szám lehet, csak tudni kell a hóké keresni, és tudni kell megérteni, mi van le írva. Ezek az oldal számok erre a négyű függőintáblázatra működnek, természetesen a többi függtállabban is benne van, meg ezek csak esetleg más helyeken. És hát nézzétérjünk még vissza egy kicsit a felszoroláshoz, mert van még egy olyan terlet, ami kényes tud lenni a beveneti értégekre, ez a trigonometria, ezen belül is a tangása alfam, Ők egy kicsit mondhatni érzékeny egy gyomra, bármit nem vezben, hogy 90 foknál illetve ahhoz kétes minden 180 fokos eltortnál nem értelmeszető. Ez a kifejezés, hogy 90 fok plusz kászor 180, ha káos csupa egész szám, ezt tulajdonképpen azt is mondta, hogy a 90, a 270, a 450, a minus 90, a minus 250 és itt tartszol ezeknek a fokoknak az összafogalásra van, itt leíra. és pper2-skászor p, a akár csak is egész szám lehet. Tehát ezt kell tudunk az értelmezési tartományokról nagy volalokban, általánosan, hogy azt kell megvizsgálni az adott kifejezés, milyen számokat fogad el, vagy milyen számokat nem fogad el. Ezek a leggyakorint érzékeny kifejezések, amelyek nem fogadnak el bármit bemenetként. Köszönöm a figyelmet!","I welcome the science blogger viewers. In this part, we will discuss the understanding of the content. What is the understanding of content? This is clear. We must remember that what is algebraic expression. Of course, I am thinking of this definition, but not of how it works. When they learn this, they usually visualize algebraic expression as a machine. We put a machine in it, This is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number, this is a number We get 2 and 3 and we get 10. And we continue to look at a different machine. We add the 2 and we get the 1 and 2. We add the 3 and we get the 1 and 3. What can be done with mathematical formalism? This machine is the 1x. Mathematics is enough for the students. So if we put 0 in the machine, it starts to break, it gets stuck, it tries to calculate 0. Then the first rubber is stuck in the machine. Why? Because you can't compare it with 0. If you want to calculate the machine, it won't work. So there are such cases when certain numbers are not possible to calculate the algebraic expression or the function. What can these be? For example, the events that we have already discussed here, that you cannot compare with 0, so if we see a random algebraic expression, or a random expression in a noun, then we have to say that what is in the noun is not possible to compare with 0, because you cannot compare with 0. Let's continue. Another neuronal point is that there are We can't even get a 4-1 from the X-1. Let's try to get a 1 from the X-1, which is minus 1, and the real number is minus 1. We have to say that the X has to be at least 2, because the machine works, and I give it a meaningful amount. We get 0, so we get 0, and 0 is 0. This is because if we have 4, we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can get only positive numbers. So we can The third point is how it works. After a long test, we can say that the pair of the two pairs can also be eliminated from positive and negative numbers. Or here, no matter what number, we can only be positive, so here, no matter what number the X is. Who doesn't believe that after thinking that the minus number 7 is minus 3, we get minus 3 times the minus number 3. There are more examples where you can keep the logic of the word. If there is a logarithmic expression, the basic logarithmic B, then we have to write two words here. One is A, so it's bigger than 0, than 0, and it's not 1. And the B is bigger than 0. Here the equivalents didn't match. The most important thing is to combine them, and to combine them in these two cases. This is a good lesson for people. You don't have to learn it, you have to learn the next lesson. This is the number. Already in this lesson, this is all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, It has a little bit of a sense of volume, but it doesn't matter. Because it has 90 degrees and the output is 180 degrees, it's not worth it. This is the expression that 90 degrees plus ks 180, if k is the total, then it's probably the 90, the 270, the 450, the minus 90, the minus 250, and this is how these values are connected to each other. and we can write it down and P per 2 is equal to P, which can only be a whole number. So we have to know this in the sense that the number of calculations is large, so that we have to check the output of the data, what numbers are received or what numbers are not received. These are the most sensitive output numbers that are not received in any way. Thank you for your attention."

Algo que ha suavizado hoy mucho la relación de sus hijos con Alfonso 10. Así que el otro día escuchábamos incluso a Calletano que daba ese visto bueno a una relación, aunque eso sí, dice que él cree que no se deben casar. Y eso es lo que todo el mundo espera ahora. Habrá boda, no habrá boda, se habla de septiembre, se habla de octubre. Desde luego lo que no se sabe es el lugar lo que sí sabemos es que la duquesa de Alba ya está en Ibiza y nos deja esas imágenes probablemente las más cotizadas de este verano 2011.

It seems that this could be a prelude to honey, José. Well, you just said it, Mercedes, we are probably facing one of the most well-known images of this summer 2011 is the Alba Duqueza, the Alba Cayetana, which the Wednesday was stepping on and vice versa, the white island, and today Friday we have seen it take his first beach bath in Mediterranean waters and look at what unpaid images this visit of the Alba Duqueza leaves us again to show that unique personality that makes it so special and we have seen him look like despite his 85 years with that bikini stamped with which we see him take the sun and refresh himself in Cala Salada where we remember his family and even attended, as we are seeing, lovingly to all those curious, all those bathers who were surprised with such an illustrious visit to the beach, in which they were enjoying, for a while, of leisure and they wanted to take a picture or even share some words with her afterwards, and then they went to the beach, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised, and they were surprised We have also seen the beach abandoned with a model that little or nothing has to envy the one that many of the young people who spend these days on Ibiza, because with that wall, with that Pamela and with that cap of mire so fashionable that we will have seen practically all the beaches of our country throughout this summer. We said that the next Wednesday would arrive and the question is, and you pointed out something Mercedes, Alfonso Diaz, his partner, will be presented in the next days to whom Ibiza is what awaits us because although they tell us that he is working after spending with his beloved, with the duke of Alba, a few days in San Sebastian, what awaits is that he is planned here in Ibiza during the next days and let's remember an important detail because a month ago, July 4, the duke of Alba, almost by surprise, shared his between his six children something that has softened and much the relationship of his children with Alfonso 10 so the other day we heard even to Cayetano that he gave that good view to a relationship although that if he says that he thinks that he should not marry and that is what everyone is waiting for now there will be a wedding there will be no wedding it is said in September it is said in October then what is not known is the place what we do know is that the duke of Alba is already in Ibiza and leaves us those images probably the most quoted of this summer 2011 Mercedes and that they say that love rejuvenates so we put a love in our lives"

So I'm going to show you a really fast easy way to do it that I use in all of my family portraits. So we've first got the image open in Photoshop that we want to be underneath where we like the family but we want to switch out the little girl. And then we're going to bring over the layer, the picture of the little girl as a layer on top. We've just dragged the picture on. In CS5 you'll see this transformation box when you drag a picture over. Just hit enter to commit that transformation. Now you can see we've got two layers here. If you click the eyeball you'll be able to turn on and off this layer. Now you can see the picture is not lined up exactly right. It's best if you use a tripod with the family pictures where you know you're going to have to swap out a head. Sometimes you have little babies that won't look and you want to get the best smile from everyone in the family. So what we're going to do is make sure that this picture is lined up properly with the layer underneath. So if you turn on and off this picture, you can see that the picture on top is moved down into the right. So we're going to select the arrow tool. That way we can move the picture over. And we've got the background matched up properly now. So we know we'll be able to swap the head without having any problems in the background. So turn the layer above back on with the eyeball tool. So what we're going to do is create a mask here. So we've got this mask. By clicking the mask button here, if you mouse over it, it will say add new layer mask. So here's the mask and here's the layer. We're going to fill in the mask with black. What that does is it masks out this entire layer that's above our layer underneath so that none of it's showing. And the hot key is shift F5. fill in the mask with the foreground color, which is black, hit OK. And now you can see the entire layer above is not showing. If you click the eyeball, you'll see it doesn't do anything because we've hidden this layer with a black mask. So now if you want to bring back parts of the layer, all you have to do is change your brush to white, select your brush tool, and then we're going to paint over the little girl's face where we want to bring back this little layer that's on top. I'm just painting over her face and then we'll want to match up the shirt as much as we can. In some pictures you'll need to paint quite a bit to get everything to match up. Now I've recreated the face here by masking in the layer on top with a white brush and masking out the rest of this picture with the black fill. If you turn on and off this layer you can see the change you've made and that will help you see if there's any weird spots that need to be fixed. When the background lines up perfectly you don't get any problems back here so that's nice. And then if there's anything where you need to bring back the layer underneath then you'll just paint with a black brush on this mask which will hide the layer that you just brought back. So there we We have a quick and easy head swap just by using a layer and a mask. If you're not familiar with layers and masks, we do sell a Photoshop tutorial program that goes over layers and masks in detail and it will save you hundreds of hours. It's also nice to use layers because then you can just tone down the effect or delete layer altogether without ruining your main image and having to go farther back in the history than you can go back.

Yahoo has accused Facebook of willful patent infringement and demanded triple damages as a result. Yahoo is asking the court to triple the damage award from Facebook on account of the of Facebook's willful, deliberate infringement of Yahoo patents. There is a distinction when it comes to patent infringement between willful infringement and accidental infringement. The courts compensate the patent holder for accidental infringement, typically by an award of a reasonable royalty. But the courts punish the infringer for willful infringement. When the infringer it knew of the patent and infringed it anyway. Triple damages are the results. So if a reasonable royalty were to be calculated to be say $10 per unit for infringement to license the patents for selling a product, then if a triple damage award were to be given by the court, then the infringer would have to pay $30 per unit instead of 10. So the costs can really add up. This was an issue by the way in the case for the Blackberry, the RIM patents, which when RIM was found to be infringing patents by NTP and RIM was forced to pay triple damages and it made the actual payments that were settled with NTP to be somewhere in this area of $600 million. So Triple damages are an issue and they are triggered when there's evidence that the infringer is on notice of the patents. The infringer is infringing while they're aware of the patents. Now they could be formally placed on notice of course by a lawyer's letter or they could simply be placed on notice by someone sending the patent numbers to the company. This often happens in situations where someone's trying to sell patents, they send the patent numbers to a potential buyer. They don't realise the implications that this is placing the buyer on notice and starting the clock ticking on a potential willful damages claim. Often they, of course, they will send the patent numbers to the potential infringer in order to place them on notice. There really doesn't make much difference as to the reason behind sending the numbers as long as the company is unnoticed. Now, of course, the implications are that companies, especially large sophisticated corporations that are often the target of patent infringement lawsuits, do not want to receive patent numbers unsolicited. They certainly don't want any evidence of infringement to be sent to them, or evidence of their infringement to be sent to them. When sending patent numbers when you're selling patents, you will often find that the recipient lawyers you send the patents to get very upset if you just send them the patent numbers through an email or through some other form of correspondence. If there's a controversy over whether the company is infringing or not, then the company can file suit, the potential buyer can file suit against the patent holder for declaratory judgment. another video on this topic in this series that we just produced that you might want to look at because that's a related issue of triggering a declaratory judgment lawsuit by sending pattern numbers over to potential buyers. Now one of the results of this triple damages issue is that discussions between buyers and sellers are often clouded in secrecy. The talks are designed in such a way by the potential buyer, the potential infringer, to avoid a trail of evidence that they're on notice. Often the lawyers representing large companies that are often the target of lawsuits prefer phone calls, face-to-face meetings, off-the-record discussions in preference over emails, letters and other written forms of evidence. Now, Patent attorneys and patent agents have special concerns here. When they're filing new applications, patent attorneys and agents have a duty to disclose all the patents they're aware of that may have relevance in this new application to the patent examiners, to the USPTO in the United States. So, a patent attorney would often not want to be aware of a patent number because that creates a duty in the attorney to disclose that patent number if it has any relationship to a new patent application that the attorney is filing. So basically there's double trouble if you send patent numbers to patent attorneys that are representing large corporations. They don't want to see the patent numbers because it places them on notice and it creates a duty to them when filing new applications at the patent office to disclose those patents, they don't want to see them in general. So what do they do? Well, many large sophisticated companies create some forms of Chinese walls within the organization. The patent reviewers are isolated from the product teams and they are arguably able to review patents without placing the company on notice. So there are certain channels set up for the intake of patents and the review of patent numbers for acquisition that is isolated from the people that are designing products and the companies argue that this means that the product designers are not unnoticed of the patents, although some attorney may have reviewed the patents, the designers in the company are designing products without an awareness of these patents, therefore they're not willfully infringing. So this is something that we often see. And this, of course, is another legal minefield to be aware of. No one really wants to pay triple damages for patent infringement, although pan holders obviously love to collect triple damages because that's where the damages go to. They go to the pan holders in these disputes. Take care and take professional advice again before sending patent numbers to companies that are producing products and especially to patent attorneys.

If there's a controversy over whether the company is infringing or not then the company can file suit, the potential buyer can file suit against the patent holder for declaratory judgment. another video on this topic in this series that we just produced that you might want to look at because that's a related issue of triggering a declaratory judgment lawsuit by sending pattern numbers over to potential buyers. Now one of the results of this triple damages issue is that discussions between buyers and sellers are often clouded in secrecy. The talks are designed in such a way by the potential buyer, the potential infringer to avoid a trail of evidence that they're on notice. Often the lawyers representing large companies that are often the target of lawsuits prefer phone calls, face-to-face meetings, off the record discussions in preference over emails, letters and other written forms of evidence. Now Patent attorneys and patent agents have special concerns here. When they're filing new applications, patent attorneys and agents have a duty to disclose all the patents they're aware of that may have a relevance in this new application to the patent examiners, to the USPTO in the United States. So, a patent attorney would often not want to be aware of a patent number because that creates a duty in the attorney to disclose that patent number if it has any relationship to a new patent application that the attorney is filing. So basically there's double trouble if you send patent numbers to patent attorneys that are representing large corporations. They don't want to see the patent numbers because it places them on notice and it creates a duty to them when filing new applications at the patent office to disclose those patents, they don't want to see them in general. So what do they do? Well, many large sophisticated companies create some forms of Chinese walls within the organization. The patent reviewers are isolated from the product teams and they are arguably able to review patents without placing the company on notice. So there are certain channels set up for the intake of patents and the review of patent numbers for acquisition that is isolated from the people that are designing products and the companies argue that this means that the product designers are not unnoticed of the patents, although some attorney may have reviewed the patents, the designers in the company are designing products without an awareness of these patents, therefore they're not willfully infringing. So this is something that we often see. And this, of course, is another legal minefield to be aware of. No one really wants to pay triple damages for patent infringement. Although, pan holders obviously love to collect triple damages, because that's where the damages go to. They go to the pan holders in these disputes. Take care and take professional advice, again, before sending patent numbers to companies that are producing products, and especially to patent attorneys.

The circle representing the natural numbers is within the circle representing the whole numbers, showing that the natural numbers are all included in the whole numbers. If we pick any number, we can point to which category or categories it fits into by pointing somewhere on this diagram. For example, if I pick 18, then 18 is a natural number. So we can point here. But since that circle is inside of the whole number circle, we know that 18 is also a whole number. If we pick 0, however, we can only point to the whole number circle, not the natural number circle, since 0 is whole, but not natural. And if I pick a number like 16.5, well, that is not in either of these categories. So we would need to point outside of both of these circles. So you can see that we're building up this sort of world of numbers, and we're going to keep adding more to it.

Even if you stick it on well, you can't really shine on the objects. I'm thinking of the mirror while I'm talking. Of course, people say that the first place is the mirror. So, depending on the effort, there are people who say that they can re-sign it. Anyway, I'll look forward to the good results. See you in 4 weeks. I have more money now. I know what you are thinking.

Nämlich zu Let's Play Mood Nation Racers Road Trip. So heißt der Playstation Vita-Ableger des Fun-Racers Alamario Kart und Litabic Planet. Sehr gut nachempfunden und immer sehr spaßig. Können wir ja gleich mal das Spiel starten, Logos. Mutnation Races Road Trip Das wir uns über die Zeit retten. Ich mache mal den Ton ein bisschen lauter. So, hier seht ihr schon ein paar. Ein Mod, nämlich das Ratchet-Kostüm von Ratchet und Clank, was ich aufletzt played habe. Machen wir mal einen neuen Mod. Ich zeige euch erstmal die ganzen Optionen, die dieses Spiel zu bieten hat. Einmal Modstudio, wo ihr euren eigenen, eure eigene Personen erstellen könnt. Ein Cardstudio. Ein Markenschott. Markenschott ist der Karrierefrei. und auch von anderen Runterladen. Ein unglaublich mächtiger Streckeneditor ist hierauf vorhanden, der hat so viele Funktionen und ganz einfach zu bedienen, ganz klasse. Und Postkarten, damit kann man sein Kart und sein Player in einen Umfeld fotografieren und dann andere verschicken. Aber nun zu unserem neuen Mood. so nennen sie sich Outfarbe, ich nehme das hier, das sieht eigentlich ganz gut aus man kann natürlich alle Teile verändern ich mache ihn einfach mal blau so, das passt so bisschen heller vielleicht, so ein Tattoo mache ich oh, angst mal, sieht doch sehr hübsch aus, dann kommt sein, sein Augen warte, die sah noch ganz gut aus Die Menüs lassen sich natürlich alle per Touchscreen steuern und ich nehme ein Grinsemund. Das ist bei allen, das ist bei Menschen auch unnötig. Wie zum Beispiel bei einer Nase. Was ist das für eine? Zu groß. Die ist auch ganz gut. Ohren? Ich glaube ich nehme die hier. Oder? Ich glaube ich nehme überhaupt keine, die sehen mir einfach alle ein bisschen zu affig aus. Es gibt nämlich einfach keine normalen Uhren. Ach doch, ich nehme die hier einfach. Aber dazu muss man auf die Menüpunkte ganz schön raufkloppen. Ich habe hier auch viele verschiedene Stile. Das gefällt mir ganz gut. Ich denke ich mache Blonde Haare, ein Bad, stylisch ein Spitzbad vielleicht. Das mache ich ihm glaube ich nicht. Das würde man sein Gewicht nicht mehr so schön sehen. Nehm ich noch Kleidung natürlich. Die Hose fand ich schön. Ob die lasse ich sogar schwarz oder? Ne, ich mache die orange. Ne, das T-Shirt mache ich orange. Die Gürtel, die mache ich blau. Na ja, egal. Passt jetzt wie so toll, aber... Ein T-Shirt, ich glaube ich nehme so eins hier. Polo-Shirt kommt immer gut an. Orang, blauer Kragen und schwarzes... Keine Ahnung. Ach, untert sie T-Shirt. Doch, das sieht doch ganz schnell, ganz gut aus sogar. Zehn doch irgendwie was. Eine Jacke würde ich vielleicht drüberziehen, aber ich glaube die habe ich leider noch nicht alle freigeschaltet. Kranskrams kann man ihm nur so halt vorm in den Kopf packen. Irgendwie ein drittes Auge. Sonst ein Kram brauche ich aber nicht. Ich werde ihn so lassen und ich nenne ihn... Ja will ich. Ich nenne ihn den lustigen Fahrer. Den Figur hätte ich damit erstellt. Beim nächsten Part machen wir uns ans Auto ran. Bis zum nächsten Mal zu Moon Nation Racers Road. und trüben.","Welcome my friends to another PlayStation Vita Let's Play! Let's Play Mood Nation Racers Road Trip! This is the PlayStation Vita of the FanRacers of the Mario Kart and Little Big Planet. Very well found and always very fun! Let's start the game right away. I tested it before. A small disadvantage for you could be that you can't create a new profile. But I will still create a new person, a new car and also race from the beginning. The charging process takes a bit longer, but I will be able to do a lot of driving. I will show you the new mod. A market shop. You can buy new cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, It also includes the PS2 player, the upload and download. An incredibly powerful game editor is here. It has so many functions and easy to operate, very cool. And postcards. With this you can send your card and player to a field photo and to other players. But now to our new mood. I will use this color. It looks good. I will use blue. I will use orange. The color is really good. You can see there are many different options. I'm going to make the orange color again. Oh no no no. It looks really nice. The menus are all for touch screen. I'm going to use a grey lipstick. I like it a lot. I like blonde hair, beard, stylish, bit beard. I don't think I would like it. I like the dress. I like the pants. I don't like the black. I like the orange. I think I'll wear the belt blue. Well, whatever. It fits like that. But a t-shirt. I think I'll take this one. The polo shirt is always good. Orange, blue collar and black... I don't know. Oh, and the t-shirt. But it looks pretty good. Tell me something. I might put a jacket on it. But I think I haven't removed it all yet. I don't think I'm doing it, but I'm doing it first. I'm taking these with a snorkel. I'm taking an orange one. I'm missing the sticker. I always made one very nice. I'm taking a flame. I'm not getting it for money. I don't want it. I didn't press it. I don't want a star. I don't want a deer and a lamb. Or whatever it's called. It's a little bit fiddly, the menu. So no, so no. Extra with a star. Yes! I do it in the blue, but I'll make it a little bit bigger. But it looks good. I think I like my mood already very much. You can give him voice, but you never hear it anyway. But it fits very well. I will leave it like that and I will call him the funny driver. The figure would I have created with it? In the next part we will get on the car. Until next time. to it."

What did you make of that decision? The other one is to spar lending. We've also noticed that banks have reduced their lending rates and moved to the fixed income markets over the last year. And this is because we've been through a slowing economic period. So I think the government is also trying to see if lowering those rates will actually spar lending. The one thing that I'm not sure will happen is that banks will follow suit they haven't done so in the past. Where to from here then, because with banks so resistant to actually lowering their rates, surely greasing the wheels of this economy is going to be as much of a challenge with rates sitting at 7% even. Well, I think the thing is investors are still seeing a lot of safety in the bonds market without regard to the fact that that is quite the rate has gone lower. So we are not likely to see any shift out of the debt market for now. What I think is that we are going to see a flattening in terms of the lending over the next few months. But whichever bank will actually take the cue and lower their lending rates is going to gain a lot because that is where everybody is going to go to. And Kenyans are now much more aware of these lending rates seeing that we have various do you see banks using this as a competitive strategy? We've just seen a slew of banks come out with their earnings reports and all of them are reporting pretty flat growth compared to what we've been used to in the past. Do you see this as being used as a tool by Kenyan banks to actually entice consumers their way and win greater market? market share? the school of thought that's being put out there is that we could well be seeing retail investors selling out of other stocks and positioning themselves in SafariCom, especially once we hit five shillings and move beyond. Do you share that kind of thought at all, where some of the other stocks may suffer as a result of interest that's being shown in SafariCom? not on the local investor side. So we haven't seen local investors actually get out of Safaricom yet. So what we are seeing is this action is actually not local. And so we're still looking at what the local investor is going to do. If they do start to exit from Safaricom, then they may take positions in other stocks, but that is yet to happen. And we haven't seen it happen yet. So at the end of the day, Safaricom remains the highest trading stock on the market. and it's really being driven by the foreign investors. I was actually, Samuel, asking you the inverse of that. Do you see local retail investors pulling out of other stocks to participate in SafariCom? I don't think so. I think they would pull out of SafariCom, seeing that most of them did burn their fingers on SafariCom and they have an adverse look towards SafariCom. So a lot of investors who are actually holding SafariCom now have been waiting for SafariCom to get back into profit so that they can get out of Safaricom. What I can't really say is how much or how many of them will go and take their profits and get out because there is a lot of them who actually got in at very high prices. Eight shillings, I think, was where a lot of people who did not buy in the IPO got in.","A cut of 75 basis points being announced by the central bank of Kenya yesterday.

And I will never remember, never forget what they said. CEO said that closing that mine allowed him to rid the warts of the company that had grown on his company. Now he called my mother dead a ward if you will. We're not warts. We're what make companies and without us they can't run. We're going to show them in the future.

In 1988, Johnson Lockton took over and Likes took over Youngstown Cheating Tube. 1988, they closed that mine. That mine had 20 years of gold left in it. And I will never remember, never forget what they said. The CEO said that closing that mine allowed him to rid the warts of the company that had grown on his company. Now he called my mother dead a ward if you will. We're not warts. We're what make companies and without us they can't run. We're going to show them in the future.

Okay, so here's the first simple drum beat. I'm gonna show you. Okay, so for me, not for you, but okay, I'm gonna show you how to use your high hand, your snare and your bass drum. Yeah, so You need to just, if your stick's right hand counts four on the snare. So like one two three four. That's like no motion, no stop motions like continuously. One two three four, one two three four. Counting your head, always counting your head. And after that we're gonna apply on and three bass drum and on two and four the snare. So it's like, this is how it's like When I use only the hi-hat then I'm gonna put in the snare and after that I'm gonna put in the bass drum and so you'll hear how it sounds all together. So this is how it goes. Well first start it slow it's like might get boring so you can second bass drum a double bass drum like a double hit not like one but two so it's gonna be like one two two three four one two 4. Oh, it's the bass version 3 again. It's the same written pattern only. Not one bass drum hit, but two on the three. So it goes like this. So yeah, you continue this. So yeah, it's about how to separate your right hand from your left hand. It's coordination. So at the beginning most of the rumors like non-drummers or Anybody who sits at the drums, they just go like... I've seen that a lot and it's annoying. So yeah. To separate your hand from the left so it's not like this, but like... And your floor tongue. And what we're gonna do is gonna be... We're gonna use our right left hand but separately. So you start with your tongue, with your right hand on the left hand after that. Right hand, hit, follows a left hand, hit on the snare. After that is the second time with right hand and left hand goes up to the first time then the right hand goes to the fourth time and the other hand goes to the second time. After that the right hand goes to snare and the left goes to the fourth time. And this is a tricky part because your hands are crossed. So it's easy in going this like So yeah, that's how it goes. This part might get tricky for you but still continue doing that until you get it. And always count in your head which drum to hit because if you don't you'll probably mess up something like... Okay, now I'm not gonna think about which drum to hit, just reflexes. Using my reflexes is gonna be like... maybe I will mess up, maybe I won't. That's what's gonna happen when you don't work with your mind as well when you play. Just like going around. Practicing these basic steps when you're having some trouble with your right or left hand or your feet. So yeah, probably it for this video. I'm not a really good teacher so yeah, train hard, don't slack off. That's your worst enemy, So yeah, when you have the chance to play the drums, play as long as you can, do the basic stuff if you're a beginner.

With more on that, here's Dolphin County reporter Portia Johnson. Curiosity always has Mae Dooley looking for answers and right now she is looking for mold. of mold here. Duly is a scientist by trade and she says it's common to find green mold in your basement after a storm, especially if your basement is finished. And hurricane comes along and the water comes in and you have some witness at the bottom of the drywall or the paneling. Then you have to cut off that, open it up, dry it out and reconstruct. This is one reason why it's such an advantage to have an unfinished basement. But an unfinished basement doesn't mean you're molding. You follow the path of the water. Duly says the big sign that your basement could have mold growing is discolored spots on the wall or floor. Many people think that concrete wall is waterproof and it's not. It's porous. It lets moisture come through. Aside from moisture, Duly says a musty smell in the basement or severe headaches and respiratory issues could also be a sign of mold. How do you outsmart the mold? Well, one way is to protect surfaces. anything that's vulnerable such as a cardboard box I have put in a plastic bag to protect it from mold but even better put items in these plastic bins because mold doesn't like plastic, mold likes wood. So what do you do with the surfaces that are wood such as these steps? You put in a sealant on them. And if you follow those steps, she says the mold should leave your home alone.

Duly says the big sign that your basement could have mold growing is discolored spots on the wall or floor. Many people think that concrete wall is waterproof and it's not. It's porous. It lets moisture come through. Aside from moisture, Duly says a musty smell in the basement or severe headaches and respiratory issues could also be a sign of mold. How do you outsmart the mold? Well, one way is to protect surfaces. anything that's vulnerable such as a cardboard box I have put in a plastic bag to protect it from mold but even better put items in these plastic bins because mold doesn't like plastic, mold likes wood. So what do you do with the surfaces that are wood such as these steps? You put in a sealant on them. And if you follow those steps, she says the mold should leave your home alone. In Dolphin County, Portia Johnson News 8. And Julie tells us that most homeowner insurance policies do not cover mold removal. So catching it before grows is key."

Anyways, this is called scrap banking. And it's used because there's a lot of people out there who don't feel like reforging all their weapons themselves. So they all get scrap bankers, that is me, to just trade them. And usually it's just two weapons equals one scrap. That's pretty simple, isn't it?

I gave him one refined one reclaimed and four pieces of scraps Yeah, four pieces of scrap and the reason to why this is such a good trade for me is that?

The other guy here, he asked me if I had a lot of items and I mean, some of them I had, some of them I didn't have. He wanted to have a paint-train.

Amém? Diga a pessoa que está ao teu lado, se prepare. Porque o Senhor nesta noite continuará a falar ao nosso coração. Amém? Abra a tua Bíblia no livro, no Evangelho de São Marcos, no capítulo 1. Nós vamos falar nesta noite com certeza se eu parasse para fazer uma enquete dentro da igreja. e começasse a perguntar você está passando por luta irmão? você está passando por luta? se eu perguntasse que igreja quem está passando por luta eu tenho quase que certeza que a maioria da igreja levantaria a mão inclusive eu quem está passando por um deserto quem está passando por uma provação quem está passando por uma grande dor uma grande algo realmente que tem tirado muitas vezes a tua paz a tua alegria algumas vezes te tirado tentado Eu gostaria que nós lecimos de novo. e os anjos onde não há o sol de dia, ele é escaldante e a noite o frio é pra queimar. Como que eu posso dizer que pode ser um lugar de glória? Nós vamos ver nessa noite que o deserto na vida do cristão, o deserto na vida do homem da mulher de Deus, o deserto na vida daquele que teme ao Senhor, o deserto na vida daquele que adora vivo e acredita que vivo ele está, será lugar de glória. para nós será um lugar que nós vamos poder dizer senhor o senhor me levou para o deserto porque o senhor queria moldar o senhor queria fazer algo na minha vida e eu tenho certeza amados alguns casos eu conheço que é deserto com grande sequidão outros casos eu conheço mais a fundo que é deserto sem nenhuma brisa é deserto sem nenhum arvore para dar uma sombrinha é deserto puro mas nessa noite Eu te louvo por estar no deserto, porque lá no meio do deserto eu tenho aprendido a te servir. para estar à disposição da igreja, porque o servo é aquele que está sempre pronto, o servo é aquele que ele não tem identidade, ele não tem, não ele está sempre pronto a servir, ele está sempre pronto quando alguém precisa dele, o servo não importa se ele está no mais alto escalão e quando ele daeramente é servo, ele consegue descer ali embaixo e consegue servir também lavando um banheiro, consegue servir varrendo uma igreja, consegue servir de várias formas e Jesus Cristo nós podemos dizer que ele pode ser chamado de servo porque ele serviu e tem servido a igreja dele até o dia de hoje. Diga a pessoa que está ao trato, Jesus tem estado ao teu dispô, com certeza ele tem estado. Deserto é um lugar onde o Senhor tem levado a nossa vida, tem levado algumas famílias, tem levado homens e mulheres, levados jovens e até mesmo algumas crianças. Porque ali no deserto é lugar aonde Deus consegue formar um caráter na vida do homem. Consegue formar um caráter na vida do cristão. Quando nós somos levados para o deserto, o Senhor tem lugar para ministrar e para nosso coração. Moldar o nosso caráter que às vezes do meio da bênção. como hoje foi falado na escola bíblica, as vezes no meio de tanta maravilha, o senhor está falando, olha Mude isso, olha no Andy assim, olha Andy por ali, e nós acabamos precisando parar no deserto, para a nossa vida, para o nosso caráter, ser moldado com o caráter de santidade. No deserto também é um lugar onde nós aprendemos a louvar ao Senhor, mesmo que ainda que não seja um lugar que nós gostaríamos. estar mesmo que não seja um lugar que ninguém quer estar porque ninguém quer estar no deserto porque se quisesse estar o senhor teria levado desde genes até apocalipse muitos homens para o deserto e foram poucos homens que foram levado para o deserto por isso eu quero te dar uma notícia nessa noite se você está no deserto amado você é um privilegiado o senhor tem escolhido você o senhor tem te colocado no deserto porque ele tem","I want to greet each one with peace of the Lord. Amen. Tell the person who is by your side to get ready. Because the Lord tonight will continue to speak to our heart. Amen. Open your Bible in the book of the Gospel of St. Mark in chapter 1. We will talk about this night, for sure, if I stopped to make a poll in the church. and start asking yourself if you are going through a struggle, brother if I asked myself who is going through a struggle, who is going through a struggle I have almost certain that most of the church would raise their hands, including me who is going through a desert, who is going through a trial, who is going through a great pain, a great... something that has really taken your peace, your joy many times, sometimes taken from you, And then the Holy Spirit, the impenetrable for the desert. I would like us to read again Say to me, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, Where there is no sun, it is burning and at night the cold is to burn. How can I say that it can be a place of glory? We will see tonight that the desert in the life of the Christian, the desert in the life of the man and the woman of God, the desert in the life of the one who fears the Lord, the desert in the life of the one who loves the living and believes that he is living, will be the place of glory. I know that it is desert with great drought. In other cases I know more deeply that it is desert without any breeze. It is desert without any tree to give a shade. It is pure desert. But this night I know that it is desert without any trees to give a shade. It is desert without any trees to give a shade. It is desert without any trees to give a shade. It is desert without any trees to give a shade. It is desert without any trees to give a shade. I have learned to glorify you, in the middle of the desert, I have learned to serve you. In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus, He presents himself as a servant. Mark, all the time, we will see that He tells Jesus as a servant, as He came to serve. As He came to really serve. to be at the disposal of the church because the servant is the one who is always ready the servant is the one who does not have identity he does not have, he is always ready to serve he is always ready when someone needs him the servant does not matter if he is on the highest scale and when he is serving he can go down there and can serve also washing a bathroom He can serve, he can carry a church, he can serve in many ways. And Jesus Christ we can say that He can be called as a servant, because He served and has served His church until today. Tell the person who is on the side, Jesus has been at your disposal, for sure He has been. Desert is a place where the Lord has taken our life, has taken some families, has taken men and women, young people and even some children because there in the desert is the place where God can form a character in the life of man can form a character in the life of Christ when we are taken to the desert the Lord has a place to minister and to our heart to mold our character that sometimes in the middle of the blessing As we have said in the Bible school, sometimes in the midst of so much wonder, the Lord is saying, look at this, look at this, look at this, and we end up needing to stop in the desert, to our life, to our character, to be molded with a character of holiness. In the desert too, it is the place where we learn to praise the Lord, even if it is not a place that we like. Even if it is not a place that nobody wants to be, because nobody wants to be in the desert, because if they wanted to be, the Lord would have taken from Genesis to the Apocalypse many men to the desert and few men were taken to the desert. That's why I want to give you a news tonight. If you are in the desert, beloved, you are a privileged man. The Lord has chosen you. The Lord has put you in the desert."

But I want to show you how it shreds paper. So, you grab a piece of paper here. I want to show you this really cool feature now. Watch, watch. Okay, look. If you stick your finger in there, it's just going to stop. So this is called safe sense technology and you're never going to have a problem with safety. You're never going to shred any fingers. Oh, I don't even want to think about that. So it totally shuts the machine off. You're never going to have to worry about it, which I think is incredible. So I'm going to just let it do its thing, finish shredding. And I want to show you what these shreds look like. So I'm going to pull out this bin. No need for bags. look at this cross cut there. Now I want to show you the most important and most exciting feature about this machine. Okay? I don't know if you notice this indicator here, but this is IntelliShred. Okay? This machine can shred up to 17 sheets of paper. But who's counting? I'm certainly not. If you're busy and you have other important things to do, which most of us have more important things to do than shredding, we're not going to be counting our paper. So I want you to look at this over here, this indicator. I'm going to put the paper in and it up, we're at red. That means we have too much paper. So what we need to do is reduce down to 17 sheets and we should be good to go. But that indicator means that you'll never jam. These problems of the past, safety, jamming, they're all gone.

I see what? It's two big R's. They're in different formulas. What we're going to do right now is find a way to combine these formulas. So watch carefully how we're going to do this. We're going to make a little substitution. Instead of S equals R minus D, notice how D equals R times R. Are you with me on that right there? Instead of writing D, could I write that instead? If D is the same thing as R times little R, would you be okay that instead of R minus D, I wrote R minus R times R. Is that okay with you? You believe me that D was R times R, right? So instead of D, what else can I click? R times, that's the same D. Yes? Same D, I can write that instead of that, and that's exactly what I've done there. You still, how many people are with me so far? Okay, now, the key part that you're not too comfortable with, that's a substitution, you should be okay with substitution, did it on evaluation all the time. Here's the thing you're probably not coming with it. We're going to factor something. Factoring is the opposite of distribution. Whereas distribution you multiply, factor means you divide. So I'm going to do this for you. I want you to notice that it does work. If I factor what I'm going to get is 1 minus r times big r. Why? Hey, can you distribute this in? Can you distribute? Check out what you get. What's big r times 1? That's it. What's big R times little r? R. R is two different things. You'd have R times little r. That's right there. You guys see that this is the same thing. Are you sure? It is the same if you distribute you get the same thing. But using this, notice how we changed two formulas with two R's into one formula with one R. That's going to allow us to solve this problem. Let's identify some stuff. So if our sale price is equal to 1 minus little r times What's S? equals, one stays the same, minus what? Point 35. Point 35, very good, because 35% is point 35 times r. We've got two steps left. The first step is do, wear operations like you normally would. That means that you subtract one minus point 35, you're gonna get point 65. See where the point 65 is coming from. Do you want to calculate it? One minus point 35. Did you get point 65? Yes. This is .65 and we still have an R. This little piece is .65R. Look at the board here with me real quick. So what we've done, we've translated this formula into something that we just created. We plugged in the sale price, got it. Plugged in the discount rate, we got that. We did order of operations, that's .65. Now can you tell me how you get rid of this .65? Magic happen, I don't know, I wrote the wrong thing. Thank you, good call. How much? $2,300. to sell them what it is. If this had come out to be like, oh I don't know, $2,000, well it's not 35% off then, it's less. I don't get the one, the one with the one-mighty-four. Sure, we factor right here, we're factoring out the big R, if you factor it out, it's R divided by R is one, this divided by R is little R, if you distribute it will give you that back again, so that R is a product of this R right there, you're dividing R by R, that's the one.","Do you see two regular prices?

C'est la dernière confrontation en Sénégalais et Marocain. Ce que se passeait pour la fédération, c'est le morro qui a choisi le Sénégal. 14 le Célégal est un bon sparring partner et on sait que les relations entre le Célégal et le Maroc sont totalement huilées et du coup ça n'a pas du tout été difficile de trouver un sparring partner tel que le Maroc qui justement va jouer ce match à domicile à Marrakech après avoir battu le Célégal à domicilisé à la carte de 0 donc le match aura lieu","3-0, the score is gone, the score is unimaginable, there are 6-0. and still 7th and same points of speed, the score is set by Natacan, only close to the end. In the difficult context, at 5 months of a cal, the Lions were taken care of in the back, except for in the domicile 22-0. It was the last confrontation in Senegal and Morocco. I think the context is different, but I still have a head. And it's about mobilizing the troops to make effective review to entaminate the 2014 World Cup Elimination, whose biggest輸agony with the mentality of the winner, the mentality of those who missed the Lions. What happened to the federation in the last moment? the Senegalese party, seeing the distance from Dakar to Khartoum or even to Paris to Khartoum because often the players of the national team go back to Paris first and then they take a destination for the players in the game. It was without the discord group that ultimately led to this match, the best in Senegal and Egypt and therefore the Moroccans seized the Balorobot. They are also preparing the players of the Mecca. The Senegal is a good sparring partner and we know that the relations between the Senegal and Morocco are completely sealed and so it was not difficult to find a sparring partner such as Morocco, Morocco who will play this match in the midfield in Marrakech after having beaten the Senegal in the midfield and in the quarter of 0."

Just relax you're not ready yet. Now if you don't know what fight and flight is, it's a natural instinct that animals have when stressed, usually by the sight of a predator. And it's the instinct that in a split second makes the animal determine whether they need to fight or leave. Now I realize that naming these two sections fight and flight Wouldn't really be right Because no matter which one you take you're going to be fighting no matter what pretty much What it boils down to is in a zombie apocalypse Do you take a sedentary lifestyle or do you take a nomadic lifestyle? I am in favor of the sedentary lifestyle now That's not to say that I would not take a nomadic lifestyle if a sedentary lifestyle was not available or stopped being possible. So for the first section we're going to talk about building a stronghold and standing your ground. Today we're going to talk about resource gathering. Now in the introduction to the series I talked about the most important thing to possess in a zombie apocalypse is awareness. Now today we're going to talk about actual physical things, physical resources needed to survive a zombie apocalypse. A lot of people out there might think that the most important thing to have would be guns and ammunition. But you're making a huge mistake there. The most important thing to possess in a zombie apocalypse after perfect situational awareness would be fresh water. Let's not forget that the goal of a zombie apocalypse is to survive. Now, let's take a look at the rule of threes. The human being will survive 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food. We're assuming that the air is not toxic in these scenarios. So we don't have to worry about that. After air is free, we have plenty of air. The next thing we have to worry about is food or water. You're going to survive a lot longer without food than you are without water. water this is a weekly par level, is 8 gallons of water per person plus 100. So if you have a crew of 6 people, 8 times 6 is 48 plus 100 is 148, we'll round that up to 150. 150 gallons of water every week. Now, you might be wondering what the hell that extra bank of water is for. Well, let's say that finding water is a little difficult one. week. You have that extra 100 gallons put back for just such an occasion. Also, what makes water even more valuable in a Zompolylps is the fact that money is going to be useless and free water, free fresh water is going to be a commodity. It's going to become money, which you can trade for other goods and services if you trust other crews and or are desperate. that as I've argued, food, you can go a little while without food. It'll suck, but you need it. If you want to get really, really technical about it, I would contend that the appropriate amount of food on a daily basis to have would be 1500 calories per person. You need just enough to stay alive. After food, the next important thing you're looking for is medical supplies, bandages, painkillers, disinfectant, things of that nature. Non-zombie wounds are sure to happen in a zompochalypse. They're going to happen. Maybe you get a little carried away and shoot your buddy. Well, thank goodness you've got all those bandages disinfectant. And then after that, number four, the fourth most important resource to gather are your weapons. Guns, bullets, and melee weapons. The important thing about having a melee weapon on you at all times Now, don't get me wrong, I'd rather not get that close to a Z. But, if I have to, I'm glad I've got a hatchet. The other thing about melee weapons, your hatchets, your swords... I don't know what it is with these sword guys, always talking about how cool your swords are, but having a melee weapon is important because you don't have to reload a hatchet. Now, if we're talking guns, I recommend two per person. some kind of rifle and or shotgun and a sidearm. Now to make things even better your rifle and your sidearm should use the same caliber rounds. That way you only have to gather one kind of ammunition instead of two. Those are the four most important resources to gather for a Zompocalypse. In the description of this video I've included a longer list of other things. Your homework assignment is to arrange them in the order of priority that you think is most appropriate. I look forward to these answers. Until next time, folks, I've been Colonel Aldous Fowler. Stay alive.","Now then, because I am better and smarter than all of you pukes, I have determined that the best way to do this series is to divide it up into two sections. And to better explain what those two sections are about, I need to get a little bit into fight or flight. And I know what you're thinking. You know, you got hypersensitive awareness. Fight and flight. What are we going to talk about? Killin' zombies. Just relax. you're not ready yet. Now, if you don't know what fight and flight is, it's a natural instinct that animals have when stressed, usually by the sight of a predator. And it's the instinct that, in a split second, makes the animal determine whether they need to fight or leave. Now, I realize that naming these two sections fight and flight Wouldn't really be right Because no matter which one you take you're going to be fighting no matter what pretty much What it boils down to is in a zombie apocalypse Do you take a sedentary lifestyle or do you take a nomadic lifestyle? I am in favor of the sedentary lifestyle now That's not to say that I would not take a nomadic lifestyle if a sedentary lifestyle was not available or stopped being possible. So for the first section we're going to talk about building a stronghold and standing your ground. Today we're going to talk about resource gathering. Now in the introduction to the series I talked about the most important thing to possess in a zombie apocalypse is awareness. Now today we're going to talk about actual physical things, physical resources needed to survive a zombie apocalypse. A lot of people out there might think that the most important thing to have would be guns and ammunition. But you're making a huge mistake there. The most important thing to possess in a zombie apocalypse after perfect situational awareness would be fresh water. Let's not forget that the goal of a zombie apocalypse is to survive. Now, let's take a look at the rule of threes. The human being will survive 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food. Now water, sure it might suck, but you can go a little while without food. You need water more. Fresh water specifically. In a later video I'm going to argue that the perfect size for any startup crew would be six. And we'll talk about that later. But that's important for this math here. I contend that the appropriate amount of water to have stashed in your stronghold on a weekly basis this is a weekly par level, is 8 gallons of water per person plus 100. So if you have a crew of 6 people, 8 times 6 is 48 plus 100 is 148, we'll round that up to 150. 150 gallons of water every week. Now you might be wondering what the hell that extra bank of water is for. Well, let's say that finding water is a little difficult one. week.

Cum comentați acest lucru? Credeți că se tame că veți preluap și fia pedaleului? Cred că fiecare trebuie să își găsească locul în care poate să facă performanță pentru PDL, în interiorul PDL și cred că, în acest moment, pari democrat liberal, are nevoie în fronte a partidului de echipă conducă de un om energic, de un om cu forță, un om cu experiența luptei cu adversarii politici, un om care poate să se lupte credibil, să se bată credibil cu Victor Ponta cu Antonin Să face prezitul nostru a membru, o cea de restă, pot de timp cu anumite la convenții? Sper să nu se întâmple lucrurile acesta. Avem din țară semnale de la oameni care ne sustin în anumite organizații unde președinții de organizații și au exprima sustinerea față de Domnul Blaga că se încearcă scoatea lor de pe listele de delegații. la Bucharest. Dacă se va adeveri, atunci vom discuta cu colegii noștri și vom încerca să nu ajungem în situația să ne reproșăm astfel de lucruri. Oricine care crede că poate ridică în acest moment partidul și poate să ducă partidul la câștigare alegerilor în 2016 la guvernare ca principal partid de guvernare, oricine poate fi viitor alt viitor candidat. Dacă o femeia a putut să fie un ministru bun, dacă o femeia a putut să facă muncă de partid, dacă o femeia a putut să-și asume rezultatul unei echipe, să-și asume rezultatele personali, dacă a putut să ia de fiecare data în competiții electorale directe în care a intrat mai multe voturi decât mulți bărbați, cred că poate să conducăști partea democrat-liberală. De fapt, sunt un tânăr politician, la generația 40, timp pentru un astfel de proiect ar fi destul. Deocamdată cred că e foarte important dacă reușesc să fiu prima presedintă de partid, alnui partid important din România, alasă într-o competiție reală și extrem de grea. În cluz și să știți că am un admisator și un president de bol foarte bun și acum o competiție foarte dura acolo să știți pentru că e greu să-l bat amând nevedere că e face o trebă foarte bună cu asociație de proprietare așa că mie greu și să le-acchi e greu și bogate e greu și la toți din greu. așa încât domnul Adreva avea agrijă ca teade de presidentă și de un simplu membr al PDLE. O să vă susin în competiția cu admii cu șeful de presidențele de bloc. Ați văzut? Vedeți? Se mă echipă din orice punct de VDLE. Cred ca nu poate fi. Organizația să laj și modul în care Organizația să laj va vota la algegerilor la convenția națională din 23 martie. Sigur, sunt absolut convins că în viitorul apropiat, pentru că suntem la în prima zi de zbatere emoțiunii douăul PDLE, unul în România, sunt convins că în viitorul apropiat o să vedeți comunicători, o să vedeți oameni care vor discuta și vor da mesaje alături de damele în Audea, pe fiecare domeniu important, pe care noi îl considerăm important, nu atât pentru electoratul, nu atât pentru PDELE, cât pentru electoratul Partidului Democrat Liberal. Pentru că noi facem, din păcate, o greșală. Noi ne gândim foarte mult la electorat, la cei care ne votează la electoratul nostru, la membri de Partid, în primul și în primul rând, și cred că ar trebui să ne gândim din ce în ce mai mult la cei care dacă nu mai suna, nu mai vibraza, nu se maiude, nu mai are semnal. sau daca doar nu-s mai place fasa lui, inainte sa... nu stii ce? eu doua clade pe mânt ai pe la noi dar nu-i ingatuita pentru ca ne-am mutat visabili de check gsmland servi si telefone noi sau second hand gsmland acum nu alocație visabili de check, lunga magazinul Helen gsmland doctor specialist in telefone mobile","Vasile Blaga declared that Elena Udrear confounded the PDL with the PDU. How do you comment on this? I don't know what context he said, but it's hard to confuse the liberal democratic party because I am a party man who has beaten all the organizations that are talking about it, all together, with the base of the party that has had projects in all the countries as a minister and I visited all the parties and in this quality. I think that this party can rebuild itself and can win the elections again. Going towards the vision I'm going to achieve, it's hard for me to believe that I can't, I don't know which party I'm going to address and which party I'm going to be. Do you think you're afraid that you'll take the party and be the one to take it? This is the analysis I won't be able to do. I think every person should find a place where they can perform for the PDL, for the PDL. And I think that at this moment, the Liberal Democrat party needs, in front of the party, a team led by an energetic man, a man with strength, an experienced man with political adversaries, a man who can fight with his faith, to fight with Victor Ponta, I believe that this leader is me. I hope that this does not happen. We have from the country, the signs from the people who support us in the name of the organization where the presidents of the organization expressed their support for Mr. Blaga, that they are trying to get rid of their lists of delegates. If it goes right, then we will discuss with our colleagues and we will try not to get into this situation to get this far. Anyone who believes that this moment can be a part of the party and can go to the party to win the elections in 2016, as the main government party, anyone can be a candidate for the next election. If a woman can be a good minister, if she can do party work, if she can take the result of a team, the results of the staff, if she can take the result of every time, in the direct electoral competition she has entered, more votes than many men. I think she can also lead the liberal democracy. I think you will have a problem in the future, in case Elena Udrea will not be in the presidential election. So Mr. Udrava was in charge of the president's office and a simple member of the PD. You will be in competition with the head of the block president. You saw it, you saw it. It's a team from any point of view. The people here are not as good as those who are on the stage, so you have to... It's hard. If you have any other questions. Mr. Udra, you know that from the previous declarations, Mr. Riboc is going to be... A better example than what happened tonight, I think it can't be. I, because I organized my college, the Council of the Judicial Coronary here at Zalău, I will participate together with Mrs. Elena Udrea and other meetings at the Council of the Judicial Coronary from the Ardea Judicial Council, where I was invited, and of course, my main responsibility, if you want, will be related to and the way in which the Salaj organization will vote for the National Convention on 23 March. Of course, I am absolutely convinced that in the near future, because we are at the first day of the battle of the two PDL emotions, a new Romania, I am convinced that in the near future you will see, communicators, you will see people who will discuss and give messages to the elected representatives of the UN, We are not only considering the electoral system, but also the electoral system of the Liberal Democratic Party. We are making a mistake. We are thinking a lot about the electoral system, about the party members, and we think we should think about the people who are voting for us. We will thank you very much. Or if you just don't like him anymore, before you know what? I give you a hand! You have to do it again! But not next to the toilet because we have moved the visa to the check. GSM Land, service and mobile phones or second hand. GSM Land, now in the new visa to the check location next to Helen's store. GSM Land, specialist doctor in mobile phones."

Diejenigen, die im letzten Jahr als Vision eingereicht haben, haben heuer als real eingereicht. Das ist, glaube ich, wirklich genialer Strech dieses Preises. Es ist auch schön zu sehen, dass visionäre Dinge Realität werden können, beispielsweise Bühne Baden. Der Bus fährt jetzt im Süden von Wien, ist sichtbar, hat Kontakte. Das ist der Sinn dieses Awards. Einerseits kreativitätfreien Lauf zu lassen, einzugeben, reichen, wie man sich das vorstellt und in wenigen Monaten später sieht man das und die breite Öffentlichkeit kann das auch wahrnehmen. Das ist schon schön. Im wahrsten Sinne des Motto Jetzt kommt Bewegung rein, realisiert. Jetzt kommt Bewegung rein, die Geschichte ist öffentlich im öffentlichen Raum und viele Einreichungen, die heuer als Visionen drin sind, werden nächstes Jahr hoffentlich realisiert. Ihr beglebt es Riesenflächen. Unter anderem einen Railjet, nämlich den Jubiläums Railjet 175 Jahre Eisenbahn. Der war 210 Meter lang und man hört, ihr macht das in einer Zeit, wie das sonst niemand kann. Das Thema Sicherheit ist natürlich am Bahnhof entscheidend. Da haben wir auch kurz darüber diskutiert, was macht bei uns und was nicht. Aber so man somalrum ist es ja tolleschön. Wie war das ein Rechnungsniveau? Wo liegt denn so die Latte der Kreativität bei ihren Produkten? Auf jeden Fall, weil das die sind, die dann das Publikum überraschen und denen ein Lächeln auf den Lippen saubern und das braucht man immer öfter. Und der Andere wäre es da möglich, zum Beispiel ja natürlich Gemüse fahrend in ganz Österreich umherfahren lassen. Ist das eine Überlegung, wo Sie sich irgendwann noch mal sagen, als Chefin von ja natürlich wäre das für Sie eine Werbemaßnahme? Da gibt es unendliche Möglichkeiten, die ich bis dato noch gar nicht angedacht habe und insofern war diese Schirierung schon sehr inspirierend für die Zukunft. Wie lustig ist denn jetzt deine neue Funktion als Shuri Mitglied? Auch die Züge, die beglebt werden, das ist für die größerte Idee. Und ich finde es sehr glücklich, weil die Werbefläche liegt brach sonst. Erstens so viele Einreichungen wie noch nie, aber man kann durchaus sagen, es ist wirklich echt. Es wird da nicht geschummelt, es ist eine echte Schurri. Es ist eine echte Schurri. Ich glaube, dass es gerade bei Kreativpreisen notwendig ist, dass man auch transparent macht, nach welchen Kriterien bewertet wird. Zu denen stehen wir und ich glaube, die sind auch entsprechend transparent kommuniziert worden und so gesehen ist, dass Schurri sich alles erfordernd und transparent abgewickelt wurden. Ich glaube, dass es aber auch eine Botschaft an die Werowirtschaft ist nach diesen Kriterien, wo man sich vor dem Dialogfähigkeit und Wirkung Zielgruppe etwas überlegt, dass man wirklich das Optimum aus dem Medien rausholt.","Why do you do this? The people who have recently entered the vision have now entered the reality. I think that's really a great stretch of this price. It's nice to see that visionary things can be realized. For example, the stage of the Bade. The bus is now driving south of Vienna. It has visible contacts. This is the meaning of this award. To let one set of creativity run freely, to enter the Bade, and how to achieve that. And in a few months you will see that and the broad public can also perceive that. That's nice. What do you mean by the motto, now the movement comes in, realized? Now the movement comes in, the story is public in the public space and many enrichments that are more than visions are hopefully realized next year. You are a huge area. And the other one, a railjet, namely the Jubilee railjet, 175 years of railway. It was 210 meters long and you can hear it, it's not going to be easy. We have made all the resources available for this project and have tried to give us the results in the weekend, during the day and night work. I think we did it very well. The most important criteria and fast glueing is the advantage of our products. It is important to reduce the time of the vehicles because it costs a lot of money. That's why our products are always attracted to such large-scale glueing. Did something happen that was a bit too much? The issue of security is of course decided on the train. We have discussed briefly what can be done and what can't be done. How was the calculation level? Where is the creativity of their products? In any case, they are the ones who surprise the audience and laugh at them. And you always need that. And the other thing, if possible, for example, of course, let Jan Fahrendt drive around the whole of Austria. Is that a thought that you would say as a boss of Jan, of course, that would be a advertising measure for you? There are endless possibilities that I have not thought about until now. And in the end, this shirry is already very inspiring for the future. The interest in the direction of the advertising industry is also in the internationalized countries. The companies in the limited countries, including the limited countries, are also interested in the advertising industry. We have a part of our advertising that we like to take over. How funny is your new functional sherry with Glitt? It's not funny, it's really interesting what it is possible. I think it's great. The buses are very well-designed. I'm glad that the advertising area is still there. and transparently developed. I believe that it is also a message to the world economy, to these criteria where you can see yourself in the dialogue and the effect of the target group that you really think the optimum is from the medium."

Estamos en el Centro Cultural Moca, en el barrio de Barracas, en Buenos Aires, Argentina. Este Centro Cultural abrió el año pasado en noviembre. Estamos muy al sur del mundo, La ciudad de Buenos Aires está remontando la boca de Santa Helmo, pero barracas todavía no. Y moca se sitúa en barracas y a pesar de que no haya una movida que la esté conteniendo, hay otro emprendimiento que es el centro metropolitano de diseño que también está aquí, pero aquí está en la boca, estamos cerca, pero igual estábamos en los lados y sin embargo eso nunca impidió que viniera gente y vemos que la gente del barrio que pasa pero además viene gente de Recoleto y otros barrios que son alejados. CES MOCA es un centro cultural donde se muestran producciones de artistas que estén vivos tratando de mezclar siempre un contenido internacional y una parte argentina. Hay propuestas que pensamos nosotras que queremos llevar a cabo y hay muchas propuestas que escuchamos. Así que eso nos encanta recibir propuestas, pero hay que recibir una propuesta no totalmente donde vayan tirando. y después siempre buscar un contexto a cada cosa que quiera pasar acá. Así no es algo aislado, sino que tiene un criterio en todo del año y en la parte del trimestre. del que ya conoce.","In Buenos Aires, Argentina, there are always possibilities to get involved in culture. The neighborhoods traditionally linked to the exhibitions of art such as Palermo or Recoleta, gradually take a step to new exhibition centers located in other places in the city. We are in the Almoca Cultural Center, in the neighborhood of Barracas, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This cultural center opened last year in November. We are very far from the south of the city, The city of Buenos Aires is going back to the south, Santelmo, La Boca, but Baracas is still not there. And Moca is located in Baracas, and despite the fact that there is no movement that is containing it, there is another business that is the Metropolitan Design Center, which is also here, but here in La Boca we are close, but we were on the other side, and yet that never prevented people from coming and we see that the people of the neighborhood that passes but also people from Recoleto and other neighborhoods that are far away. CES MOCA is a cultural center where they show those productions of artists who are alive, trying to always mix international content and an Argentine part. There are proposals that we think we want to carry out and there are many proposals that we hear.

È un momento difficile nella nostra società. Oggi un giorno è tutto e poi il contrario di tutto. E la società all'aroveccia. Quale bussola? A cosa ci si può aggrappare? non bisogna battersi, basta anche una piccola cosa, una piccola vela da seguire, un amico che ha una bella idea, una ragazza che sotto e chi ti ama o ti vuol bene o spasi ma per te, anche quello è bellissimo oppure un lavoro anche se non è proprio il tuo, anche se non è quello che ti desideravi poi quello che desideri lo coltivi per obbio e il resto attenti di inserirti in una società e fare il meglio possibile col tuo lavoro, io sono ottimista il futuro e sui giovani tantissimo perché non si può andare peggio di così e i giovani sicuramente cambieranno molte cose. Certo, fomforà, Svia, quando uno magari anche pluri laureato e poi si vede mobbizzato in un'azienda. Se c'è anche di peggio, ci sono persone che vengono cacciate, persone che non hanno più lavoro, persone che da un giorno all'altro perdono la loro fabbrica. Non è soltanto pluri laureato che non riesce a lavorare, ma è magari un operario che ha lavorato la vita e che provvisivamente non sape come mantenere i figli, ma è una situazione purtroppo di emergenza di una società ormai catastroficamente involuta che è quella italiana. Forse l'abbiamo creata poco alla volta anche noi facendo che cosa sbagliando, spendendo troppo, dandoci troppo a cose inutili, non programmando bene economicamente le situazioni e anche un po' questo lo dico perché purtroppo ci credo ritrenendoci un po' troppo più importanti delle cose prendendoci troppo sul serio. posso far muovere le pietre? ma credo che sia una specie di sogno che è tipico di chi si sente, non deve darmi male, si sente artista, non lustogiosamente, esageratamente artista, ma quello che trova una soluzione con l'emozione alle cose. Quando l'emozione è prepotente, grandissima, ti vengono in mente anche i miracoli, io pensi di paterniciare. Sì, che è poi di ogni tipo d'arte perché sappiamo benissimo che l'arte non si deve sempre capire, a volte basta sentirla, sentirla emozionalmente. Se dovessimo capire l'arte, per esempio davanti a Picasso, davanti a Candinsky, non sapremo cosa dire, invece lì si sente, non si capisce Sì, che è poi di ogni tipo d' ogni tipo d'arte perché sappiamo benissimo che l'arte non si deve sempre capire che l'arte non si deve sempre capire, a volte basta sentirla, sentirla emozionalmente se dovesse capire l'arte, se dovesse capire l'arte, per esempio davanti a picassu' e candinsky, non sapremo cosa dire, invece si sente non si capisce Perché è una somma di tante cose, è una sfida grossa, è una sfida che è partita con la stazione di Isimà, questo dialogo con un Dio che io ormai faccio da anni, tentando di farlo in maniera non banale, in maniera seria. C'è un momento in cui si ricorda, è nato il dialogo con Dio, c'è sempre stato. No, no, no, io direi che c'è sempre stato per me, in qualche modo c'è sempre stato. Anche nei pensieri serali, nelle preglieri inventate, nelle frasi in cui mi rivolgo a lui, so che mi sta a sentire. che anche questa forse è un'illusione, anche questa è la ricerca di un miracolo, ma io ho questa fortuna, ho una fede d'osso e me la voglio tenere ben stretta. È una fede dubbiosissima, piena di dubbi, di incertezza e sicurezza perché nasco il luminista, so la materia quanto è importante, vedo gli errori del mondo, purtroppo le tragedie del mondo e molte cose non so spiegarmene, però la fede c'è. Quando vado a parlare nella rosa e blu che come sai non esistono, sono fiori inventanti, chiedo a Dio di salvare il mio figlio che ha una malattia grossa e per chiedere gli do in cambio non la vita che è facile perché basta si muore e finita ma tutto quello che si vive che è un'altra cosa perché quello che viviamo lo facciamo noi è proprio nostro non ci lo impone qualcuno quindi dare quello che vivi per la salute di tuo figlio è il massimo che puoi fare. una risposta arrivata si sentono questi momenti io sono voglio fare che voglio sembrare un pazzo scritteriato no? un mistico ma per esempio in questo caso abbiamo avuto di c'è stato un risultato perché mio figlio è guarito che malattia beva se ce lo può raccontare? ancora una malattia che non si può togliere una malattia che non si può eliminare però che può anche finire a un certo punto lentamente perché le medicine migliori non sono e la sclerose multipla sono 4-5 anni che il ragazzo sta bene e sta meglio e quindi io mi illudo che questa pregliera sia servita qualcosa e come le rose blu anche San Marcanda è una città immaginaria i miei lunni mi hanno chiesto di parole questa domanda mi hanno detto chiedi che posto aveva in testa quando ha scritto San Marcanda sì è vero perché non ci sono mai stato San Marcanda io non ho Qualsiasi città medio orientale, ho pensato, quella con i bazar, qualcuno sognò le geni in libri, perché poi si assomigliano tutte da Algeria, arrivare fino a San Marcan da, sono molto simili, perché volevo una grande confusione, una festa notturna molto forte, delle belle luci, delle belle stelle, ho pensato anche a una qualsiasi guerra, perché non c'era una specifica, è un momento di imensa gioia, perché la guerra è finita, pare che tutto sia tornato a posto, invece lì La cosa che oggi le fa più rabbia è cosa invece le dà speranza? e la stupedità è una colpa avanti hanno consegnato i reddità continue e che quindi va amato anche da solo e di per se stessi.","Roberto Vecchioni has always been the singer of the young people, he has always invited them to his dream. It is a difficult moment in our society. Today, one day it is all and then the opposite of everything. And the society is at the crossroads. What is the compass? What can we grasp? I say hello to you, to all the listeners of Radio in Blue. I think the compasses are very important. You don't have to fight. Just a little thing, a little veil to follow, a friend who has a good idea, a girl who loves you, loves you, loves you, or, even if it's not your own, even if it's not what you wanted, then what you wanted is for hobby. And the rest, be careful to insert yourself in a society and do the best you can with your work. I am optimistic. and the future of the young people. It's a lot because you can't go worse. Young people will change a lot. Of course, it's a bit of a waste when you work more and then you get involved in a company. If there are even worse people, there are people who are caught, people who don't have any more work, people who lose their factories in one day. It's not just working, but it's a work that has worked and that you don't know how to keep your children. But it's an emergency situation, a society that is now catastrophically involved, maybe we created it a few times too, making things wrong, spending too much, giving too much useless things, not programming the situation well economically. And also, I say this because I believe it, keeping things more important than anything else. Taking us too seriously. Italians have this habit of saying that there is no one like me, every Italian. A habit of humility wanted us. It would still be so, because no one is perfect, they need to help each other. Do you remember the moment when he said, perhaps from this word, or in poetry or music, Can I make the stones move? Yes, it happens to all those who write with a crazy emotion, thinking that you can move something. I made two or three songs with this intention. One says that I can move the diaries and make them cry. And one is the rose blue. I even say that I can move the destiny that God has foretold me. Instead I completely change it. I think it's a dream that is typical of those who feel bad, who feel artist, not exageratedly artist, but what I find a solution with emotion. When the emotion is very powerful and great, you feel like miracles. Yes, it's about every type of art, because we know very well that art should not always be understood, sometimes you just have to feel it emotionally. If we had to understand art, for example, in front of Picasso, in front of Candinsky, we don't know what to say, but instead you feel it, you don't understand it. The blues are a song here, it is particularly linked. Let's talk a little bit about the music. Why is it a sum of many things? It is a big challenge, a challenge that started with the Isimà station. This dialogue with God that I have been doing for years, trying to do it in a serious way. There is a moment in which the dialogue with God is recognized. There is always been. I would say that there has always been for me, in some way there has always been. Even in the evening thoughts of the invented prayers, in the phrases in which I am involved, I know that I am feeling. This is an illusion, a miracle. I have this fortune, I have a faith, I want it to be tight. It is a very dubious faith, full of doubts, uncertainties and security, because luminaries are born, I know the material, how important it is, I see the errors of the world, unfortunately the tragedies of the world, I don't know how to explain many things, but faith is there. When I go to talk about the blue roses, which, as you know, do not exist, they are invented flowers. I ask God to save my son, who is a big disease. And to ask him, I give him in exchange, not the life that is easy, because he just dies, it's over. But everything that lives, which is another thing, because what we live, we do it, it's our own, no one imposes it. So giving what you live for the health of your son is the best you can do. There is a moment in which he has heard that, on the other hand, of communication, I want to make it look like a written shit. No, it's a mystery. But for example in this case we had a result. Because my son is pregnant. What disease did he have if he can tell us? Still a disease that cannot be removed, a disease that cannot be eliminated, but which can also end. At some point slowly, because the doctors may not be able to tell us what it is. I'm a little bit older, I was a multiple skater. I'm 4 or 5 years old and the boy is fine, he's better. So I'm jealous that this prayer has served something. And like the pink and blue, also Samarkand, it's an imaginary city. My students asked me to answer this question. They told me, who was the one who was in the head when Samarkand wrote it? Yes, it's true, because I've never been to Samarkand. I thought that the one with the bazaar, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with the book, the one with The problem is born, because at that moment there is drama. The thing that makes them more angry today is what gives them hope? I get angry at the ignorance of people, the fact that people turn from the other side, they don't think of others, the egoism has taken over, the irresponsibility, the blame is always given to others but to themselves. All these things that are very Italian, I must say, they give me a lot of trouble, I have always given a lot of trouble. The stupidity is not the cultural ignorance, it is not the fault of a person. And they have an intelligence, even that is not the fault. But the stupidity wanted to be that is a fault. And what gives them more hope? The boys are very much. Very much because you just have to see them turn on their eyes, you start to understand what they say, you start to understand that the world has been slowly built by souls, by minds that loved it, that brought it to life. they have given the constant inheritance and that therefore it is loved only by himself."

Dazu gibt es eben verschiedene Hilfsmittel, wie die Augensteuerung, die der Team verwendet und der Diakonie im Powerment von verbunden, macht eine solche Kommunikation möglich. Dadurch wird nicht nur eine benachteiligten Gesellschaftsgruppe wieder zurück ins Leben und vielfach auch wieder auf den Arbeitsmarkt verholfen.

For one year, we have been working with the Diaconie, where we help people with disabilities or special needs to receive communication services. The jury is honored by this project, the close connection of the business with a socially highly relevant problem. The employees' and staff's involvement is also important. This is motivated to engage in a free-spirited basis for the affected people. Communication is a basic human rights. There are people, like the team, who need a little support to communicate with them. There are also various aid tools, such as eye control, which the team uses and the Diakonie empowerment fund, makes such communication possible. This will not only help a repatriated group back into life and help many times the labor market. The company itself, the employees and the employees, will also benefit from this empowerment project.

Let's go to Song Play mode. Many Korg arrangers, including the PA900, have the ability to not only play standard MIDI files, but to actually play two at the same time and crossfade from one to the other. In fact, Korg is the only company in the world with this unique patented technology. Plus, the PA900 is able to do this with not only standard MIDI files, but karaoke MIDI files and MP3 files as well. from the internal memory or from media inserted into the USB host port. As mentioned at the start of this video, if you want to follow along with this exercise, you'll need a USB flash drive with at least two MIDI files, a karaoke MIDI file, and one MP3 on it. Insert the flash drive here into the USB port on the top right of the PA900. Touch the player one area on the screen and the window opens to select a song you want. Currently the internal drive is displayed, so touch here to change it to the USB drive we inserted. Touch the name of one of the MIDI files. If there are several files, you can use the scroll bar to move up and down or touch one of the files and use the dial. Once the song you want is selected on the screen, touch Select. Make sure the crossfade slider is all the way to the left and then press Play on Player 1. The song is loading and playing at the same time, so it starts almost immediately. Now touch the Player 2 area. Then again. You can also use the Select button beside either of the transport controls. Select the USB drive and repeat the previous process of selecting the song you want for Player 2. Touch Select and then press Play on Player 2. Use the Crossfade slider to smoothly change from one song to the other. Crossfade back to Player 1. Press Stop on both players. Some MIDI files have lyrics embedded in them, for example a file with a .KAR extension. Let's select a .KAR song for Player 1. Press Play. To display the lyrics, press the lyrics button located to the right of the dial. The lyrics follow along. By the way, the PA900 can even display the plus-G graphical format as well as lyrics embedded in MP3s. If there are no lyrics embedded in MP3s, you have the option to have the lyrics in a text file and use pedals or switches to advance the pages of text. Pressing the score button displays a selected track's musical notation. Press exit and stop. As mentioned earlier, MP3 files can be played in song play mode as well. Select an MP3 file for player 1. Press play. Of course you can crossfade between any of the formats you play in song play mode, including MP3. But you can do much more. Playing an MP3 on the PA900 is very flexible. For example, you can transpose the song. By the way, pressing the two transpose buttons simultaneously resets the transpose to zero. You can also adjust the tempo. Hold down shift and use the dial to jump to tempo adjust. The volume of the lead vocal can be lowered so you can sing over the MP3. You can assign a foot switch or of the assignable switches to do this. Let's assign switch 3 to this function. Hold down shift and press assignable switch 3. Scroll over and set it to vocal remover on off. Press exit. Remember that only the vocal is lowered in volume, not the reverb of the vocal. So the less reverb there is on the lead vocal the more effective the removal is. This control of an mp3 allows you to take a song, a adjust the pitch to a key you can comfortably sing it in, remove the lead vocal, and sing following the lyrics displayed on the screen. You'll be able to perform almost any song. Incredible power. Press stop.","Song Play. Let's go to Song Play mode.

Let me briefly describe what the process was and how we picked are two winners just for a moment. The most important thing in many ways is to be able to demonstrate that what we are doing in science, in neuroscience, in genetics, in neuroimaging can be translated and applied to dealing with patients and the need for new treatment. And both our winners this evening demonstrate a commitment to that. For the researcher of the year, the criteria that we were using was a level of motivation, and I would say probably also passion. What we call, I guess, in the United States, out of the box thinking, thinking a little bit differently than most people. innovation that is very apparent of cost-scientific excellence and clearly outstanding achievements over time. And that is clearly, I think, represented in our first winner. For the outstanding research project, what the advisory group and the panel was looking for was originality of the project that challenged challenges, again, commonly thought assumptions and ideas. Clarity and clearly the scope of a project that could be done in the time that we have allotted for this award. Naturally none of us operate alone and part of the evaluation was the appropriateness of the team that is working with our winner. relevance of the project to the missions of fundamental, which you've already heard a bit about. Now, we had really, it was not an easy job, since we had a considerable number of very, very good applications. And frankly, I think the committee was saying, well, maybe we should give more awards each year. But I think at the end of the day, we were able really to select two wonderful people. And this international jury, which was really a committee composed of members of the International Advisory Group, which is a group of individuals from the United States and various European countries, felt very, very comfortable about the recommendations. And indeed, I would say the excitement, therefore, of these first set awards should I hope be obvious to all of you and we are really very, very pleased to present the first set of the SALT prizes. And hopefully they will establish a precedent for the importance of not simply the award, but what it stands for. And what it stands for is a commitment to excellence and a commitment to change and changing the way we think about mental illness and what we can do to change what happens, unfortunately, to many of our patients and many of our family members. And so let me really move very, very quickly to giving you an opportunity to hear brief presentations from both our winners. And we will first have the research project of the year that Stefan who's already been presented to you. And really what he will be talking about and the reason that his project was picked is that it proposed work that deals with genetic mutations and a family of genes and proteins that may help us understand the vulnerability of why individuals at a very young age develop bipolar disorder. And the project was particularly exciting to the international jury because it involved both working with patients but also working then with potential animal models which could validate what we've been learning from patients and then taking those validations back to doing future studies with patients in clinical populations. And so let me at this point present Stefan who will give you at least a brief overview of his project.","Good evening.

And one of them, our Miss Porto de Pedras, Daniele Ferro. Daniele, thank you very much for participating in the program Gestão a El. And I'm going to ask you a question. What is the expectation, how is it to participate in an event like Cusmice and Lagos, that probably It will represent Brazil, for sure. It will represent the waterfalls in Brazil. But how is the expectation and responsibility? How do you see a competition like this? It is a very big responsibility and it is a huge pleasure because our state has not only bad things, it has many good things, people in our state are very hospitable, very warm, so it is a great satisfaction. And participating in this event that represents beauty, One of the good sides of our state is the beauty of the Lagoana woman. So, it's a great satisfaction.

Taking this title, I'll show Brazil the beauty that the Lagoana has not only externally, but also internally, that the Lagoana woman is determined, she has strength, she is a fighter. So, many people don't know, right? Sometimes criticize the Northeast and I'm sure that if I go to the misalagoas, I'll show that the Lagoas has a good one. Daniela, who is a journalist, probably is a career projection, right Daniela? Being recognized as a beauty of Alagoas, going to Brazil, who knows the world, is she impulsing herself, helps to push the career? Help! If I say no help, I will be lying, help like this. The journalism opened many doors for fashion, for events, because communication helps a lot, right? We, as a communicator, They support me because they think the following is my happiness and their happiness. So if I'm doing something I like, they will be happy. So they always support me because they want to be happy. They are happy because they are happy. They are happy because they are happy.

So, the International Program for Girls 10, 14 to 18, and it is a program to help girls to recognize their dignity as models of the great designer. So it's a program of formation that culminates with, at the end of the eight months, a fashion show in the local area. So you serve just young women from the ages of 14 to 18? That is correct. And we also include their mothers in several of the 14 information monthly program features as well. Do you have any basic principles or foundations for the organization? Yes, we operate on six core principles and they're really virtues or human qualities and they are purity, authenticity, generosity, self-confidence, style and grace and we're really helping the girls to incorporate this into their lives. Okay. And the young girls that you serve How would they get started with your program? How did they get going and involved with you all? Well, as we launched the program here in the Triad this year, we went around and posted posters in many of the schools and churches and public places guiding the girls to the Pure Fashion website. And they could go and click on to Greensboro and get the information to submit their application. Great. What exactly would participants do once they got into the program? Once they fill out their application, those are reviewed, and then the girls are contacted with an acceptance letter, and then we begin the formation pieces, which are done once a month. The girls get together for different things, such as public speaking, etiquette, missions, so they have a heart to serve. We have a heart and soul weekend, where they really get to the heart and soul of who they are as children of the great designer. And we have a lot of fun in the process of it. Are many of these programs that the girls are involved in? Are they strictly just all the girls together involved in this? Are they usually the mothers and the daughters? Well, it depends. We just held our mother-daughter tea at the Weir Jordan House in Greensboro last Sunday, and we had a lot of fun. We had 93 participants. They were our models from Greensboro, our models from Raleigh. It also included supermodels, which are girls who have come through the program, and they are able to come back and actually serve as leaders in the following years. And their mothers joined us as well. It sounds like some great things that you all are doing. Yes, we've been very fortunate with the people who have been called to serve alongside of us in terms of the speakers that we have lined up to present to the girls. And I know that many young girls struggle with self-esteem issues and self-image issues. What do you all do to help counter some of these problems? Well, I think just having the speakers really speak to their heart, and I think for the girls to be in a room with other girls their age, these are girls that come from many schools. Some are homeschooled, some are in private school or Christian schools or the public schools and from different areas. And for them to come together and see the uniqueness that each one is in God's eyes and that they all have something to offer. And I heard you say you had 93 girls participate in the tea that you all had. Is this about the number of girls that you have participating in the program?

Der Digitalausgang von den beiden CD-Playern ist jeweils mit einem Digitaleingang vom Mischpult verbunden. Das heißt, hier gehen wir auf den Kanal 1, Kanal 1, hier gehen wir auf den Kanal 2, Kanal 2 und der CD-Player ist jeweils per USB mit dem Rechner verbunden. Einmal, zweimal. Es ist egal, ob ihr die CD-Player jetzt über das digitale mit dem Mischpult verbindet oder ob ihr ganz normal die Chin stecker nehmt. in diesem Video möchte ich euch erklären wie man mit zwei Pioneer CD-R 400 die Software Tractor steuern kann welche Einstellungen nötig sind um das folgende darzustellen. Als Setup haben wir zwei CD-R 400 im MIDI Modus. Wir haben ein externes Mischpult und wir haben ein Rechner mit der Software Tractor. In der Software finden wir das Deck A und das Deck B. Deck A sollen mit dem ersten CD-R 400 geschaffen mit dem zweiten gemixt werden soll über das externe Mischpult. Das Milimapping wurde soweit gemacht. Das heißt, drücke ich bei dem ersten CDJ 400 auf Play, starte das Deck A und am Mischpult liegt auf Kanal 1 ein Pegel an. Drücke ich auf Stop, stoppe die Software bzw. das Deck. Nun starte ich Deck B, drücke auf den Sinkbutton, sehe das Deck ist gestartet, und sehe, dass am Mischpult auf Kanal 2 ebenfalls ein Pegel anliegt. Deck B, Deck A. Eine Anstellung, die nötig sind, damit ich das Signal vom Deck A getrennt von dem Deck B ausgeben kann und ein externes Mischpult mit zwei Signalen versorgen kann. Das heißt, ein Signal von dem CDA 400. Eins und ein Signal von dem CDA 402. Wir haben anfänglich nämlich folgendes Problem. Unter Audio Setup habe ich die Möglichkeit zwischen den beiden den CDJ 400 zu wählen. Das hat aber zur Folge, dass ich unter Output Rooting lediglich ein Stereo-Kanal eines CDJ 400 habe, den ich einem Channel zuweisen kann. Das heißt, in diesem Fall habe ich jetzt einen CDJ 400 dem Channel B zugewiesen. Wenn ich nun beide Signale getrennt voneinander ausgeben möchte, müsste ich theoretisch dem Channel A ebenfalls ein oder den anderen CDJ 400 zuweisen. Das ist derzeit aber nicht möglich. Man löst das Problem nun folgendermaßen. Ich öffne das Programm Audio MIDI Setup, welches mit OSX mitkommt. Das heißt es ist keine externe Software. Und sehe jetzt mal unter Eigenschaften, dass ich derzeit sämtliche Geräte auswählen kann, die verfügbar sind. Das heißt ich habe das Mikrofon, den Eingang und den Ausgang von dem MacBook in diesem Fall und ich habe die beiden CDJ 400. Ich habe nun die Möglichkeit über Geräte Editor öffnen, ein neues Audio Gerät hinzuzufügen. Das mache ich folgendermaßen. Klick auf das Plus, gibt den neuen Gerät einen Namen, in diesem Fall sagen wir 2x CDJ 400 und kann nun diesem Gerät die Ein- und Ausgänge der derzeit verfügbaren Geräte zuweisen. Das heißt ich erstelle quasi ein virtuelles Gerät. Wir benötigen jetzt die beiden CDJ 400 und sehen jetzt unter Eigenschaften, dass das neue Gerät vorhanden ist und sehen hier unten, dass das neue Gerät 2 Stereokanäle hat. Ausgänge der CDJ400 in ein Gerät zusammengefasst. Wenn ich nun wieder in die Einstellung von Traktor gehe unter Audio Setup das neue Audio Device auswähle, 2x CDJ400 und dann unter Output Routing dem Channel A-Eingerätzuweise und dem Channel B-Eingerätzuweise habe ich das, was ich möchte und zwar die Möglichkeit beide Audio Signale getrennt voneinander auszugeben.","The digital output of the two CD players is connected to a digital input from the mix-pull. I want to explain how to control the software tractor with 2 Pioneer CDJ400. As setup we have 2 CDJ400 in the MIDI mode. We have an external mixpult and a computer with the software tractor. In the software we find the deck A and the deck B. Deck A should be connected to the first CDJ400. The mini-mapping is done. Press the CDJ400 on play and start the deck. Press stop to start the deck. Press the sync button. and see that the mixpult is connected to channel 2 also. But that has to do with the output routing of only one channel of a CDJ400. In this case I have a CDJ400 B. If I want to give out both signals separately, I have to show the channel A or the other CDJ400. That is not possible at the moment. You solve the problem as follows. I open the program Audio MIDI Setup which is available with OS X. That means it is not an external software. And now I see that I can choose all devices at the time that are available. That means I have the microphone, the input and output of the MacBook in this case and I have the two CDJ400. I now have the opportunity to open the device editor. To add a new audio device. I do that as follows. Click on the plus, give the new device a name, in this case we say 2 times cdj 400 and can now the access and access of the devices available at the time. That means I create a virtual device. We need the two cdj 400 and see now that the new device is available and see down here that the new device has two stereo channels. and the two outputs of the CDJ400 are connected to one device. If I go back to the settings of Tractor Gear under Audio Setup, I select the new Audio Device, 2x CDJ400 and then under Output Routing, I select Channel A and Channel B. That's what I want. And to separate both audio signals from each other."

I'm inside right now use this general area This is to make sure I have control of all the distractions Very beginning stages. I kind of want to see us a verse her first session today. I want to see where she's at. How much does she know? She has a solid sit I love that and it helps us accelerate some of her training already We don't get it down in and the next session or two I want to solid down, I want to solid down stay. So let's introduce today just to stay cue period. As you see in your homework, I have a leash dragon, I have a toy, I have all these things already ready. I'm gonna teach her a stay cue and at the same time I'm gonna teach her to anticipate the release, which is an okay cue. The release cue is very important when you train a stay because what good is a stay if your dog can get up when it wants. So we want the dog to get up when we say it's okay to get up. So therefore you train two cues in one, it's to stay and it's the okay. So it's two cues being communicated to the dog in these instances. So practices throughout the weekend, the next time I see her she should have a solid stay. use a toy to distract her a little bit. No matter what distractions going on, I ask you to stay. That means stay. So when she does get up, a light NOPE will help in developing no reward marker, meaning you missed the opportunity and gently put her right back in the same spot. Try it again. Now she keeps getting up on over and over again. She either has to potty, she's not motivated enough and stuff like that. I'm not sure if you can hear me or not. motion using that word nope nope so as you see it playing simply just like that nope put the dog right back in the same spot and we'll do it again okay so my goal today is about five to seven seconds maybe twirling the toy around a little bit so let's see what we get come on girl so notice when I click trade good girl so I see her coming in like that I back off a little bit sit Good, stay. Good, stay. Now notice I'm not moving anywhere. Good, stay. Okay, good girl. Okay, and I tossed the tree so over there so she has to get up. Therefore we try it again. Good girl. Stay. Okay, so I don't want that lay down. I don't want that. I want to sit, stay. Okay, so I drag it with my feet. I use my feet to drag the leash so she has to get up. Sit, good girl, stay, good girl, stay. Click treat right there, stay. Now I'm taking a mental count of the seconds. Three, two, one, good girl, okay. I don't want her to lay down. This is a sit stay. So in essence, we're not training a down stay yet, we're training a sit stay. When she's laying down, she's actually breaking the sit stay. Okay. Stay now I'm not moving anything good. Hey good girl. Okay good girl So what I'm using today is actually her kibble. This is what she gets a full bowl of twice a day But yet now we're learning. Okay Sit Good girl good job Stay Stay stay. Hey girl. Oh, so now the intro For the toy, so I'm swinging around a little slow like this nothing too fast To make it hard. I'm making it easy when I say stay that means come on come on girl. Good girl. Sit good job Stay and open it good girl. You that right in here. I'm waiting for her to look right back at me Good girl. Okay girl. Okay, since that's the stay cue I want you to practice someone throughout the weekend I want you to just use the toy and you'll see you can start moving it faster and faster She actually didn't get up at the one time I made her get up a couple of times because I didn't ask her to sit I want to ask her to sit And if we're get that behavior when she sits on her own like that It's not in it's not what I want Cool you get to you can sit that's cool. What about sit when I asked you to sit? What about sit stay when I asked you to do it? That is what we want a thorough sit stay cue and I think this will help out in some of her little issues as far as your nation I think confidence, it gives you something else to do.

My favorite clothing brand besides CLN probably had to be I want to say either Crooks and Cassies or 10 Deep One for me, what is your strategy for test taking at school? I don't really know I just I might answer a question on stupid I have no clue. Another one for me. What size shoe do you wear? I wear an 8 and a half. How often are you on Facebook or Twitter? I'm on Facebook or Facebook right now. I can speak. I'm usually on Facebook or Twitter. At least 6 hours per day. At least. I want Facebook probably 12 times a day. just like all day in my Facebook basically. And Twitter probably three times a week. My question for you. Well, if you're a girl I'll probably text you and if you give me some information I'll probably text you. So, if you give me some information I'll probably hit you up. It's another one for me. At Street Bomb 268 and Twitter. Jared you're such a fag. I saw you gay stealing it and it blew hard. I can do all those tricks first try and I'll beat you. Well first of all in the first place I'm not gonna care if your Twitter account name is Street Bomb 268. Since you're such a fag. First of all, probably jealous of our amazing team and probably some old fat guy in the count just to piss us off. So sick. You're gonna stop trolling. I hate you. I with if you skated any pro and why. I probably wouldn't skate with Tori Padwell because he's amazing. He's a cool student ever. And he just seems a really cool guy. I don't know how to skate with him. Teachers and stuff. The other text, that's about it. So I'm fronting it up. Here's your text. Hit us up on Twitter if you want to have more texts or Facebook or anything. And we'll respond to them on our next section. See ya later."

And he's had what to do was just to contact as many promoters that I could really find. My idea was to start off in New York State, that's where all the Irish Americans are. If nothing comes from there, go wider, go Boston. I've got a friend over there, go Boston. I had a load of really good feedback and stuff. New York initially was the first one that I got from a company called Uprising Promotions. They were the key, then they stopped talking to me. I had a team from Arizona. I had a team from Arizona. I was a big Irish community in Arizona, so I've been learning as I've been doing it and I've been learning as I go. There's a big community in Arizona, they call me Azirish, which is quite funny. And then they stopped talking to me and I just carried on. It's like I always do. Never say die, don't quit. You're fighting it's over basically. 39 year old, yeah I'm 14 September, I'm a big wistful kid. I've reached top of the mountain, someone said to me, you've sat at top of the mountain now, you're on a personal mountain. Now what are you going to do? Reach for the stars. It looks like it. It looks like it. It's my dreams with the Irish title. Being Irish champion has always been my dream. And the belt's my keeps now. And I've been fortunate to get it. It took me five goals, but I've been fortunate to get it. I think I've been fortunate, I work hard here, but I've been fortunate to get it. And then, you know, I want a little more, I want something else, I want to take some more boxes, you know, America's next, you know. So now August the 8th, upstate New York, baseball ground, open air, Hentik and Mathieu Jr., what else is, you know what I mean? It's like, I'd have been quite happy to box them on the undercard over there, just to tick the box that I wanted to tick. in my own head, just to take the box, just to fight in America, no matter where he was. As it happens now, it's a baseball ground, it's open air, main event, the posters behind me, it's in the gym, it's top of the bill, it's Etikomacho Junior, I've said it before, say it again if you want. Etikomacho Senior, his dad was a brood hero in mind, there was a few fighters that I absolutely idolised, I love to come out to you, I love Dagla, I love Vinnie Pazienza, Limiston Bramble, Edwin Rosario, all that kind of era, the 80s, early 80s, when I was around 13. I love all that era. Now, head to come out to you senior, unfortunately, he got shot last year, you know, my question is so. And had I been going over there to fight the head to come out to you, I think he won seven world titles. I'd have been going over there full of belief just like I'm doing now. I'd have been going over there full of belief Waiting to pull off an upset, you know ready willing to pull off an upset I've been going over there fighting I'm going over there and I'm boxing his son. It's a commat your junior. It's not his dad, you know He was designed to be a superstar. He was this he was he was designed to be world champion You know what I was designed for to go on dig roads. That's what I was designed for right when I left school when I was 16 I mean dad says don't worry I've got your job and I was like oh great what we're doing when you're digging I was like digging I don't want to dig it says you don't want to do anything over the box you're digging you know that one Camacho Jr came off in school I bet he won't dig in roads up and scouring concrete and digging out claying you know I mean and look what he's got look what I am I'm a neck and neck now I mean Camacho a neck and neck with air now you know designed for stardom designed for digging roads and being a you know and drinking beer. That's what kind of my people were designed for. It's like anything else, isn't it? You've got to get out of the boxes that you get put into. That's all I ever try and do. Just try and get out of the boxes that I've been put into. And if you can understand that, try quantum physics."

Det är extrem på sidan och fattade inte varför jag skrev flukost. Varför klockan var så mycket? Varför skrev jag flukost? Är det något implanerat? Men det är faktiskt... Vad är det där kippledare? Sitter han press och får en repap. Det här skriver jag som en... Han gillar vi. Det här är snyggt. Det är bra spridat. 5,6 miler på hit, man. 14,7 på flukost. Och sexlånga minuter till pass. Sexlånga? Våren till på hos då? Vad tror du? Det känns som att det var en sån roll. Det blir så mycket att vi gör en fastid. Du vet ju själv vad du skrev alldeles med. Skulle han säga att det är sammin. Men han sparade den till utomhus faktiskt. Här är nog ingen som har gjort någonting för att försvåra arbetet på det sättet. Jag hade aldrig tänkt om någon hade varit riktigt rysig. Det är ett lite trum. Det var någon som frågade där vem som har lagt värsta mörken om decenningen. Du trumpetade lite glatt när vi var ute senast men det var ändå utomhus. De tar tempo på andra, bara en sekund. Det är en stor del, så det är ju starkt. Han vill ju riska mindre varje höjning. Men trots att Hitman nu är kort, så höjer han fortfarande större. Det är varje pot när han höjer. Frukost ligger på 420. Det är en tuffit. Senast Hitman höjde så höjde han upp till 532. 1600. Du gillar han det, små att han att fixa till dem där. Han borde tidigare att fixa till de där 668. Det är en liten... Det blir syd S5 och S8. Han kan få femma. Skall du avgöra oss på en uppdragning här? Du har en fyrtio. Det är en ganska sköna ökning då. Vad är det första, för att sen du hade varit med i 160? Nej, det var en annan plöts och han har faktiskt en live-trykning. Väst spelade hälsa. Fruktansvärt bra. Vad tänkte du på när du var nere på var 1,8? Eller var du nere på som mest? Du har haft ett enormt tålamål måste jag säga. Jag har haft bättre koll på Hitman eftersom han har legat topp 5 så länge som han har gjort. Hur såg du för dig första dagen? Du var precis utanför de som jag höll koll på dig. När idag tog du upp regel till toppen. Må du åg vad du hade för händer då? Hur mycket spelar normalt? Hur mycket har du tänkt på det? När du kom över 100 000? Ja, sen var det bra struktur också. Man hade ju råd att få bra händer. Ja, jag tycker att strukturen var bra. Jag tycker att du har utnit strukturen. Man var ju otroligt mycket mer offensiv än vad du var konstant. Men i med strukturen som såg ut som du gjorde. Så hade man ju möjligheten att spela med det större tålamålet som jag tycker att du gjorde. Ja, om han var riktigt bra, det var svårt att möta av dem. Det blev mycket småt. Vad bor du någonstans? Stockholm. Vad har du? Vad länge sen? 5-6 år sedan kanske. Ja, det är något som du somnar. Hej!","5.5.2 and 10.2 I'm on the side of the road and didn't get why I was going to the breakfast, just because the clock was so much. Why should I go to the breakfast? Is it planned? But it's actually... ...what about the food? He's sitting there and getting a repub. He's going to be the one to... ...he's not ready yet. Again. That's nice. It's good for the mood. 5.6 miles on a hit man. 14.7 on breakfast. And 6 long minutes to the break. 6 long? Get another break then. What do you think? It feels like it's been a long time since I've played in the same team as last year. You know where you were writing, you should have said that it was Samy. But he saved it for the house. Here is when no one has done anything to make the job difficult. I would never have thought that someone would have been really sad. It's a small room. No one has been there. No one has asked who has the worst mark in the show. You trumpeted a little when we were out last night, but it was still out of the house. I don't understand if someone had really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really He wants to risk less than every height, but even though he's short, he still has a bigger preflop than every height. The focus is at 420. I think he's sitting with a... what's his name? We're seeing S5 and S8. He's got 5! Are you going to give us a lift? He's got a great place on a big board! Swedish master on Swedish games! What's the best you've won before? It's a pretty nice increase. What's your first place when you won 160? No, it's another place where he won his life. Very well played, it helped. You're a newbie, what did you think when you were down on 1.8? Or was it down the most? I've had a lot of problems, I've had better calls after he's been on top 5 for as long as he's done. How did it look for you on the first day? You were just out for those I've been calling on. When did you get to the top? Do you remember what happened? How much do you play normally? Is it because you have gone bad that you have decreased? Yes. And then you will be the newbie of what you have planned to do for 929,939 kronor for the deal? I have not planned. You have not had so much time planned? You have been good for 532,000, at least it is quite long time at least. I don't think much about that, you are the most focused person. We got many questions about how you get nervous when you get up and play about the money. How much do you think about the money when you are in the final board? How much do you think about just taking it further and further up? When I came over 100 000 I drove about 2 000, I didn't think much about the money. You became a member of the Spenstyrn and became a member of the Eta. Now you became a member of the Spenstyrn and became a member of the Eta instead of... When you came over 100 000 years ago. Yes, it was a good structure. You could feel the high level of people. I think the structure was good. You opened the structures. You were much more offensive than you were constant. But with the structure you saw as you did. You had the opportunity to play with the big scale. Yes, he was really good. It was hard to meet him. I've been to the airport. Where do you live? Stockholm. Yes, it's almost like that. Can you tell me where you've been? Yes, yes. In the capital. In the capital? Yes. Maybe you've been to the old town before. Is there anything you'd like to say about your age? Yes, I can. 26. 26? You're almost an old man. We had a final with the most four players around 1920. I have only one thing left to say when I leave you and let them congratulate you officially and then you will come from Visby. But I only have a free ticket for you. A license, we can get it on SwedishNest before SwedishPlayer will go. Marcus. Then I and our Marcus, which is about 939,000 kronor, get what you are. The best creator in the tech industry 2009.

These are a few of my favourite things. And a good job too, because Nindagaden 2 is full of them. Well, except for the exploding kittens, but werewolves didn't rhyme. This is one big gore fest from top to severed toe. You, Ryu Hayabusa, must strive to defend the powerful ancient artifact your clan has guarded from the Archfiends as you hack and slash your way through hordes of ninja opponents who with admirable pluck and determination will still come after you even if two or three of their limbs are scattered on the other side of the room blowing themselves up in a last-ditch effort to pull you down. The combat animation is great and the non-squimish of you will revel in the sheer brutality of the game littering your weight with more blood and body parts than Titus and Dronecus. But if you don't quite fancy that then you'd better buy something else as beyond a few bits of basic platforming and shopping to improve your weapons, that is pretty much all there is to the game. And so that becomes the real question with this game. Is the fighting enough to carry the title? Well, yes and no. When it works, it works beautifully. The pace is delightfully furious, and if you can get the time on right, really very fluid. And as a whole, a raft of weapons and combo moves to master and full magical nip on attacks to incorporate, you can the whole thing fresh and varied. But there are also some serious annoyances, such as not being able to defend against certain types of ranged weapons or sudden difficulty peaks, particularly with bosses where you'll all of a sudden and with no obvious reason why, find your ass repeatedly handed to you on a plate. Getting past these moments will often feel like luck rather than experience or epiphany, making some of your successes rather bittersweet. Now the Ninja Gaiden series is notoriously difficult, but this title has been made a little more accessible. Your health will automatically recharge itself which seriously helps, and there are lots of pickups dotted around the place. Move combos and introduce and you also get reminders as you continue. And while subtle control will require time and skill to achieve, you can at least see its coherence from the get-go. And certainly on the acolyte setting, you should be able to button mash your way through the first few levels easily enough. The biggest problem with Ninja Gaiden 2, though, is the camera. The default look sensitivity is really, really slow, and pulling the right trigger to re-sensor the camera behind Ryu's head can easily disorient you given the pace of combat. It also has a nasty habit of positioning itself badly against warheads walls or through doorways and there are times when you can only move the camera within an unrealistically narrow field, usually noticeable when you're being bombarded by projectiles from an unseen source. Switching to first person view, which is intended for looking around, doesn't really help either. And there are also some issues with the graphics. While the combat is animated really well and the opening location of Sky City Tokyo looks gorgeous, then compared to what we got with Prince of Persia's Sounds of Time or God of War 2, the majority of Ninja Gaiden 2 just doesn't look that cutting and locations of flats empty and repetitive. And the cutscenes, when compared to say Delmay Cry 4, although abounding with cherry blossom and heaving bosoms, are rather lacking in detail. There are also technical problems with some rendering flaws and tearing, severed limbs getting stuck in mid-air and some very noticeable drop frames in places. So in conclusion, this is a fun bit of fast-paced ultra-violence, which will certainly get some regular play after hours at the Fletcher household. But it's not quite the polished production it could have been. out but if you're going to buy this make sure you take it for what it is. Sometimes ninjas aren't deep. It's a pretty decent three stars."

Considerando o total de medalhas, independentemente da ordem cronológica em que foram ganhas, podemos dizer sobre a média ME, a mediana MD e a moda M.O. do número total de medalhas. Vamos então inicialmente observar que esse gráfico tem no seu eixo horizontal o ano e o local de cada uma das olimpíadas, e que imediatamente após o ano e o local de medalhas. local aparece aqui em azul a quantidade indicada aqui no eixo vertical. Então temos que observar que cada dois tracinhos e meio desse aqui corresponde a uma medalha por isso que cinco traços batem em duas medalhas aqui e como há mais um, dois e meio traços nós temos aqui então três medalhas. Essa forma de contagem será usada para todas essas colunas azuis uma delas correspondendo a um ano e um local da olimpíada. Note que nesse eixo vertical a quantidade de medalhas é a quantidade de medalhas ganhas pelo Brasil em cada uma dessas olimpíadas. Podemos então marcar agora as quantidades usando essa informação que demos aqui para a primeira coluna e que comentamos será aplicada para todas as outras colunas. E agora podemos começar o cálculo aqui o que o problema pede. a média que ele pede é a média aritmética simples. Basta então somar todas essas quantidades de medalhas e dividir pelo número total de limpidas. Se você contar aqui o número total de colunas, você vai ver que é igual a 17. Podemos então fazer a média, média aritmética simples, igual a soma dessa quantidade de medalhas ganhas pelo Brasil em cada olimpíada e a divisão desse número, dessa soma, pelo número 17. o número total de olimpíadas. 5. Vamos agora parar a obtenção da mediana. A mediana é obtida a partir da ordenação desses valores das medalhas obtidas em cada olimpíada. Ordenando esses valores nós temos a distribuição aqui em ordem crescente dessas 17 quantidades. Como o número de quantidades é o número ímpar, isso facilita a nossa vida porque a mediana por definição é o número do meio no caso de um número ímpar de quantidades, o que é o caso aqui uma vez que há 17 quantidades. Temos então, como mediana, o número 3. Se você contar aqui a 8 antes e 8 quantidades depois do 3. 8 mais 8 é 16 e a 17, que é justamente essa quantidade do meio, é o número 3 sendo ele, portanto, a mediana. Já temos aqui como opção a letra D que indica o 3 e a letra A que indica o número 2 poderia ser descartada mas temos ainda que ver aqui o que vai acontecer com a moda a moda por definição é a quantidade dentre essas quantidades de medalhas aqui que mais apareceu se você contar aqui o 1 aparece 3 vezes o 2 aparece 3 vezes e o 3 aparece 4 vezes note que nenhum número aparece mais vezes do que o 3 quando uma roupa está na moda ela aparece muito né então aqui o 3 é a moda porque ele é o que mais aparece a quantidade que mais apareceu sendo portanto MO é igual a 3. Note então que MO aqui está indicado como 15 e aqui como 3. Podemos então escolher mudar qualquer uma dessas duas opções. Vamos mudar essa aqui colocando a moda igual a 3. Temos então média igual a 5, mediano igual a 3 e moda igual a 3. Como indicado aqui. credencia letra D como correta, encerrada a questão.","The graph represents the distribution of Olympic medals in Brazil. Considering the total of medals regardless of the chronological order in which they were won, we can say about the ME average, the average MD and the MEO mode of the total number of medals. Let's then initially observe that this graph has in its horizontal axis the year and the location of each of the Olympics, which immediately after the year and the The number of notes in the vertical axis is shown in the blue. one of them corresponding to a year and a place of the Olympics. Note that in this vertical axis the amount of medals is the amount of medals won by Brazil in each of these Olympics. We can then mark now the quantities using this information that we give here for the first column and that will be applied to all the other columns. And now we can start the calculation here and the problem The average that he loses is the average arithmetic of 5. Just add all these quantities of medals and divide by the total number of cleaners. If you count the total number of columns here, you will see that it is equal to 17. We can then make the average arithmetic average of 5 equal to the sum of this amount of medals won by Brazil in each Olympic and the division of this sum by the number of 17. The total number of the Olympic Games can be obtained by counting the columns in blue. Let's now stop the median. The median is obtained from the coordination of these values, the medals obtained in each olympic. By coordinating these values we have the distribution here in an increasing order of these 17 quantities. As the number of quantities is the impa number, this makes our life easier, because the median by definition is the average number. in the case of an input number of quantities, which is the case here, once there are 17 quantities. We have, then, as a median, the number 3. If you count here, 8 before and 8 quantities after 3. 8 plus 8 is 16 and the 17th, which is precisely this quantity of the middle, is the number 3, being it, therefore, the median. We already have here, as an option, the letter D, which indicates 3, and the letter A. which indicates the number 2 could be discarded but we still have to see what will happen with the fashion. The fashion by definition is the quantity given between these amount of medals here that more appeared. If you count here, 1 appears 3 times, 2 appears 3 times and 3 appears 4 times. Note that no number appears more times than 3. When a clothes is in fashion, it appears a lot, right? So here the 3. It is the fashion, because it is what appears the most, being therefore MO equal to 3. Note that MO is indicated as 15 and here as 3. We can then choose to change any of these two options. We will change this one by placing the fashion equal to 3. We have then media equal to 5, median equal to 3 and fashion equal to 3. we will believe the letter D as correct, and close the question."

So let's create a task that does that. We will go back to our workflow and what we do is that let's say that we want to make it orange. So everything that is a new term proposal it should be orange so that I can can see it clearer. So let's call it new. I don't need to write description of this. So this is view term in list basically just because I just want to have a color so that I can view it in a list in a different color. Let's activate this and let's set now the details. So what was the condition? Well, process status is unprocessed. And this is of course the default value that we get when we have a new term. And what do we want with this? Well, I want you, or we want to make it the field. We want to make it orange. Orange. And I also select the term. OK. So when process status is unprocessed, make the term style orange. I save this, and now just switching back. I can now say directly in my list that all the terms matching this condition that have the process status unprocessed are now in this color. So it's much easier for me to see them when I have all the sections selected. Of course, another way that I can do is I just go into the suggestions section and I can also see here the these terms that are matching with these process status. All right, let's say that I'm happy with that. I just want now to go and start translating this. Now I am an administrator so what I do is I edit the term and I just change the status. Let's say that I've checked everything, it looks fine and this is something that we should have and let's go for translation. Now this status is very important to notice here. This is not fixed values. This is something that this forest is this to be translated is something my own value I created it and I put it myself so nothing is fixed this is very important and this is a difference with this workflow that everything is based on your own values the ones that you use and we create you know this flow for your own company let's say to translate it here and then the only thing that I do is I say okay now this will trigger another email and so on but we don't you can take my word for it, another group will be notified. And what will happen is that we have this task happening now. So with statuses to be translated, send an email to translators. So every translator will receive an email. And now let's say that I am the French translator. I'm logging in here as a translator French. I can have access to the French translator. bit more dictionaries. Again, everything is up to us to define it. Nothing is static here. I will go to this. Normally I would have the link again in my email and I would just jump right to it and let's say that okay I would like to edit this now. You can see the mail dropping in. So what I do here, I have no access. I only have access to what I need to have access to. I add the French term. and I can add a variant, I think this is French, if you want variants and so on, it's up to us. I don't need to do anything else, I don't even need to change the status. In this case we said whenever you save this and you update this then someone else will be notified and so on. We could of course set that okay you have to change the status and then someone else will be notified. Again everything is up to us, but in this case okay this is fine and I just saved this. So this in turn triggers another task or a series of tasks. Let's go as admin again and into the workflow. And what it will do now is it will signal a new term. So what we have now is, so when the section is suggestions, we have it there and the language is French signal now the French SME that will go in and check that these French translator translation is good. So this is the validation time. And you can see here now we have a combination of conditions that say it is a suggestion and for the French language. So now we can branch out our flows. We can have a separate flow for the English translation, another one for the German, another one for the Swedish and so on. And they can have their own flows with their own people connected to them. So nothing again tells us that we have to have a validator and then a translator and then that everything is flexible here and everything is up to us to decide by just creating more tasks. In this case now we said the French should send an email to the French SME Let's log in as a French SME Which is basically a validator role and again, I would get the email and I would go directly to this Sorry, we are in French now. I would go directly in here. I see the history again I see the proposer the administrator the translator everything I see exactly when it happened so I have pretty good control of what is happening here. And then I just edit here and I have access to more, as you can see here. So at the same time, please note that I cannot edit the English language because I am French as a me, I can only edit the French. So this language is locked.

Con ella vamos a conversar acerca de la nutrición de los niños en vacaciones de invierno. Doctora, gracias por acompañarnos. Es difícil pensar en cómo van a comer los niños, considerando que están de vacaciones, que están la mayoría de las horas en la casa, que hace frío además y que lo más tentador son las colosinas. ¿Cómo están? Hola, buenas tardes. Bueno, es difícil. Es difícil decidir porque que uno los quiere regalonear, pero nada es tan difícil cuando los tenemos en la casa. Yo creo que aquí lo más difícil es cuando salen, porque en casa nosotros podemos preparar, ya que lo estamos cuidando, preparar desde el desayuno hasta la hora de comida, todo lo que se prepara en casa tiene menos azúcar, tiene menos grasa y por lo tanto con eso podemos darle una alimentación más o menos saludable. No es todo golosina y además podemos hacer golosinas en casa. Como cuáles son los que de aquí golosinas podrían ser entre comillas? y que los niños la acepten. con harina, con poca azúcar en la casa, porque eso la mamá siempre va a tener a ponerle menos azúcar. Un cuchón de fruta, por ejemplo. Claro, también pueden ser galletas, donde nosotros podemos unir algunos frutos secos, que a los niños les llama la atención y las podemos hacer trozados y nos parece más atractiva. También podemos hacer quiquis, masanos, donde nos van a tener la misma cantidad de azúcar que tienen los que son comprados. Los pasteles, también los vamos a poder hacer y los podemos hacer con merengue, de la casa en vacaciones. ¿Hacer como actividades juntos también ayuda? y eso va dando el mensaje de que nosotros vamos a comer y el sistema nervioso va saciando poco a poco porque empezamos a sentir olores y a practicar y no empezamos directamente a comer que eso también el sistema de saciaría, que es el sistema de la gente que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos va a comer y que nos es más tarde y a lo mejor comemos un poquito más. Ahora, y es bueno que ellos se involucren. ¿Por qué más? Comparte. Sí, nutricionalmente hablando y psicológicamente hablando también. ¿Usted como docente recomendaría más hacer ese tipo de actividades en la casa que por ejemplo, mitad de los a comer afuera, que también es un panorama súper típico si estamos de vacaciones? Claro, no yo creo que es bueno que se mantengan en casa primero que nada, porque hace frío y ellos se van a exponer a otra, yo sé que es entretenido, pero se van a exponer y además van a comer siempre en los lugares preparados porque es más rico, más grasa, más azúcar. Por eso es que la mamá puede, digamos, preparar en casa. Eso es lo recomendable. Ahora si van a salir, que sea con poca frecuencia, porque también nos lo podemos mantener todo el tiempo en casa. Es una tarea igual a hacerlo entretenido. Claro. Porque ante el panorama de salgamos a comer. Es difícil competir y decir a vamos a la casa. Claro. Ahora, pero eso a veces, bueno, yo se lo explicando desde antes a los niños, porque los niños van a ser partícipes y no solo socialos, sino que a la compañía el hecho de hacer cosas juntos e involucrarlos en eso, que a lo mejor pueden ser más atractivos que la misma comida. Doctora, ¿qué está prohibido en la alimentación de un niño? Estoy pensando en un niño menor de 14 años, estoy hablando desde los 5 hasta los 14 años. ¿Hay alimentos que estén prohibidos? Porque sabemos que la fritura y la grasa hay que disminuirla o hablar su mínima expresión. ¿Pero se puede hablar de alimentos prohibidos? No, si es un niño que no tiene ninguna enfermedad, no, no hay alimentos prohibidos. Todos lo podemos consumir siempre y cuando no tenga algún tóxico que es otra cosa, preocuparse de la parte sanitaria pero prohibido nada, ellos pueden comer de todo, lo importante es regular la cantidad y la frecuencia de consumo, ¿cuántas veces como? Hablemos de para ir terminando esta entrevista de ¿qué es mejor qué? Por ejemplo, ante la opción de una bebida gaseosa con azúcar ¿qué alternativa es mejor? Jugos de fruta que yo puedo preparar y si voy a salir es preferible un jugo que una que una bebida. Yo usted me lo decía a la hora de 11, pero repitámoslo, frente a un escenario de esos paipillas, por ejemplo, calcieros rotos, es mejor que. Ahora, que es que? Casero es mejor. Ahora, yo puedo hacer alguna masa horneada que así no voy a freír. En la hora de la comida. Y en la hora de la comida, digamos, guisos calientes en esta... y alimentaciones donde yo los niños pueden diferenciar los alimentos, que lo fean. No que vayan todos juntos. y eso descubrir qué es lo que más les gusta. la noche. Es el hora tope. Sí, y los niños mayores porque incluimos niños de 14 años, ellos pueden ser cerca de las 10 de la noche, pero igual como es la hora ya de descansar, tiene que ser un poco más liviano si lo vamos a trazar la hora de comida. Muchas gracias doctora por acompañarnos, la doctora Carolina Stein, docente de la Universidad Mayor nos daba los consejos súper prácticos a la hora de alimentar a los niños en la casa, sobre todo cuando están en vacaciones, fruta, nos decía la doctora privilegiar jugos en vez de bebida, en fin, consejos súper útiles que usted puede aplicar en su casa. Los invitamos a nuestra última pausa comercial y ya seguimos con 24 horas de vida.","We are back with 24 Hours of Life and we are already in the study with Dr. Carolina Stai. We are going to talk about nutrition for children during winter vacations. Dr. Stai, thank you for joining us. It is difficult to think about how the children will eat considering that they are on vacation, that most of the time they are at home, that it is cold and that the most tempting thing is the food. How are you? Hello, good afternoon. It is difficult. It is difficult to decide We can prepare it from breakfast to lunch. Everything that is prepared at home has less sugar, less fat. So we can give it a healthy diet. It's not all about the hallucinogen. We can also do hallucinogens at home. What hallucinogens could be? We can play with some things. Although fruit seems a bit attractive, we can mix it. with flour, with little sugar in the house because that's what the mother will always try to put less sugar. With fruit cuffs, for example? Of course, they can also be cookies where we can join some dry fruits, which children call attention and we can make them pieces and it seems more attractive to us. We can also make cookies, more healthy, where they will not have the same amount of sugar as they have, those that are bought. The pastels, we will also be able to make them and we can make them with meringue. We add some fruit, which is natural, and we add sugar. That's how we make it. It's a kind of technique, including children who cook with us, especially thinking about parents who have the opportunity and the luck to be with the children at home on vacation. Doing activities together also helps? Yes. The process of feeding always stimulates us from the first smells. And that stimulates us. We start to get drunk a little earlier. If we don't find the food prepared, we may not measure it. That's why it's good to prepare it. We introduce it first. We cook together, we eat something late. That gives the message that we are going to eat. The nervous system gets drunk little by little because we start to feel pain and practice. We don't start eating directly. and maybe we eat a little more. And it's good that they get involved. Because they love to share. Yes, nutritionally speaking and psychologically speaking too. You, as a teacher, would you recommend doing that type of activity at home, for example, to invite them to eat outside? That is also a very typical topic in our vacation system. Of course, I think it's good that they stay at home, first of all because it's cold and they are going to expose themselves to others. I know it's entertaining, but they are going to expose themselves and they are also going to eat in the places prepared because it is richer, more fat, more sugar. That's why the mother can prepare at home. That's what is recommended. Now they are going to leave, which is a little frequent, because we can also keep them all the time at home. It's a good idea to do it as a training. Because before the program we leave to eat. It's difficult to compete and say we are going to go home. Sure. But sometimes, well, I'm explaining it to the children beforehand, because the children are going to participate and not only social, but to the company, to do things together and to involve them in that. That they can be more attractive than the same food. Doctor, what is forbidden? The food of a child, I am thinking of a child younger than 14 years old, I am talking about 5 to 14 years old. There are foods that are forbidden because we know that the fat and fat have to decrease or reduce their minimum expression. But can they talk about forbidden foods? No. If it is a child who has no disease, no, there are no forbidden foods. We can consume all of them, always and when. It's not toxic, it's something else. It's to worry about the health aspect. But it's not forbidden. They can eat anything. The important thing is to regulate the amount and the consumption frequency. How many times do you eat? We'll talk about, to finish this interview, what is better? For example, before the option of a soda drink with sugar. What alternative is better? Fruit juice, which I can prepare. And if I go out, it's preferable a juice, I would say it at 11 o'clock, but let's repeat it. In front of those paipillas, for example, calciero roto, it's better than. Now, ques, ques, caseros, it's better. Now, I can make some baked dough, which I'm not going to fry. At the time of the food. And at the time of the food, let's say, hot stews, and food, where children can differentiate the food, not that they go all together. and finally an important issue is the schedule. What time can be the last food taking into account that if we start to cook in different bakeries that have their routine in normal way, they can be affected in some way. The age group is quite wide but in general in smaller children, smaller school, no more than 9 of them, The elderly children, because we include 14-year-old children, can be around 10pm. But since it's time to rest, they have to be a little lighter. We're going to delay the time of the food. Thank you very much, doctor. Dr. Carolina Stai, a teacher at the University of Majority, gave us the super practical advice when it comes to feeding the children at home, especially when they are on vacation. in your house we invite you to our last commercial break and we continue with 24 hours of life 24 hours of life with Viviana Martínez"

Además se procura que la basura se trate lo más cerca posible del lugar de generación para evitar el transporte. El caso de la materia orgánica, que supone casi la mitad de la bolsa de basura, es muy fácil y barata de reciclar, pero debe recogerse limpia de tóxicos para obtener un compostaje de calidad que pueda ser comercializado. Aunque la idea es sencilla, lo cierto es que la gestión de este sistema depende de muchas variables como el tamaño de la población, el clima, el tipo de viviendas. Lo que sí es necesario para que este plan sea efectivo es tener el apoyo de la industria para que diseñe productos ecológicos fácilmente reciclables. Sin embargo, los planes de basura cero no son imposibles ya que ya están funcionando en ciudades como Buenos Aires, Puerto Rico y la región italiana de Treviso, entre otros. Desde ecologistas en acción y desde Gaya se anima a los colectivos sociales, a las autoridades y a la ciudadanía a sumarse a esta iniciativa.","Reducing, reusing and recycling are the basic principles that are repeated over and over again in the Gaya International meeting.

In addition, it is sought that garbage is the closest possible place in the generation to avoid the waste.

And it was made in a way that was originally created by some humanitarian organizations. I don't have two months to do that. It's just a part of the Slovenian folklore. What do you think, Boris? Did you agree with the writer Moscow and Washington, New York, what do you think about those years of experience and thoughts about those areas? I think, I wrote to my mother that if Slovenia were to get a prize, it would be nothing. Because it was a land achievement. I think that those thoughts and groups are not pure, pure, and open, because I think that we are because the money was sold on the market on the market. We were talking about how to sell the photo, and he said that he wanted to give it to him, but he didn't take it because he didn't want to take it, so we took a photo. The biggest media organization, including Human Rights Watch, was the one who sold the photos for the most money. They were not so smart to sell it, to thank them for their work.

We never asked the world media to ask us to do it. We never wanted to be able to take pictures of it. We are a little unspoken. We know it. I think that the whole year we will go to a boy who is in my care. and that, let's say, it's a new day. In the face of the conversation of the humanist, and if he wanted some anonymity, some secrecy, he would want to take all the phone calls and all the electronic stuff, because if the parliament is wrong, the Slovians will look at it a little bit. The God of the ordinary, who is not allowed to be taken off, and he doesn't want to be taken off. What is the conversation about this? Probably about the reason why we have been recommended to people and the public, the world public, and the demand. On the other hand, our writer, to talk about the critics who talked about how some taste of love is used and how it was used by human-loving organizations, she is doing what the journalists are doing, trying to find out what the and they said that they would do it easily. And then they called the sherrime, they would give them a lot of underground leaves, and they gave them a lot of underground leaves, and I think that... as they say, FSBs are exactly the same as the ones in the Rally. I think that they are smart, but I think that they are not. Thank God, they want to be smart. and then I recognized where I was born. The second day was the day when we were the children and we didn't even take photos of it. Instead of having them as human beings. That's our problem. We should take it. We shouldn't say that our weaknesses are his demands and our weaknesses are to be praised. That's the risk. We took a picture of him there and I think he was born. I mean, that's one of the biggest and biggest Slovenian journalism, I would say, in the last summer. In the last summer? Yes."

La necesidad y insatisfacción. Interse las uñas como muestra de elegancia, de estilo y femenidad, está en la actualidad de todas las mujeres. La manicure todo mucho tiempo y no todas las mujeres disponen de tanto tiempo ya que algunas estudian, trabajan, estudian y trabajan. A veces salen eventos improvisos, etcétera y no tienen tiempo para una spa o una peluquería para que les dan las uñas. Entonces, no existe un mecanismo portátil de buena calidad que facilite la manicure. La más práctica, rápida y precisa. La estrategia del producto en mercado. El mercado meta será mujeres de 16 a 36 años aproximadamente, de nivel económico, ahí de, que más o menos representa en el 30% de la población liménea. Son mujeres modernas y de eso es que es muy activa. Estas cuidan mucho su salud, su figura, su imagen. Entonces la calidad para ella es un factor decisivo al momento de hacer la compra. Estas mujeres más o menos son afortunadas y modernas. Competencias, en competencias tenemos a Victoria Sigret, Unique y Sison. Estas tres porque representan calidad, representan tradición, trascendencia, modernidad, juventud. Entonces, están dentro de... satisfacen de las mujeres que están dentro de nuestro mercado meta, por eso vendrían a hacer competencias directas. La propuesta del producto, los atributos serían los siguientes. Este es un aplicador portátil. Un producto en forma elapicero que facilite la manipulación y el pulso. Este tendría dos contenedores a los extremos. En uno es Terellis Malty y en el otro es Estonia. Y bueno, se llama Pink porque significa rosado y esto es un color relacionado a muchas de las mujeres. Estos contenedores se encontrarán en los extremos y en una tendrá el esmalte para pintar las uñas en el tronacetona para hacer cualquier corrección en caso de desmate se salga de la unión. El diferencial relevante sería que la manipulación sería mucho más rápido y más práctica. Habría una manipulación más sencilla y una corrección de errores de pulso en caso de que se salga el esmalte de la unión. Sería portátil y recargable. Posicionamiento. Queremos que se posicione en el mercado como el pinta y despinta unión más práctico y exclusivo del mercado. Marca tributos relacionados. Exclusividad solo para mujeres y en lugares exclusivos. Feminidad solo para chicas. Es de calidad porque nos encargaremos de que sea un producto muy bueno y exclusivo. Y practicidad ya que sería un dispositivo super sencillo, pequeño, recargable y portátil. El precio. Según la evaluación del mercado de los competidores tendría un precio inicial de más o menos 50 soles, el dispositivo. Y los esmalte y el acetón de recargables tendría más o menos 20 soles. Porque estos productos serían también producidos por nosotros. El mensaje, la promesa y el soporte. El mensaje será ofrecer la posibilidad de pintarse y de pintarse las uñas de manera más práctica con un aplicador portátil y exclusivo. La promesa es ofrecer exclusividad, calidad, practicidad a nuestros clientes. El soporte será mejor tecnología en cuanto al aplicador y los ingredientes, ya que el esmal de la cetona tendrá en este ingrediente muy específico ya que queremos que este seque más rápido y que no dañe las uñas. Los medios en los cuales saldrá de la publicidad de Pink será televisión, revistas como cosas y somos, paneles, en las calles, en las universidades e internet. La distribución se dará en boutiques y centros exclusivos como en Yopip. Gracias.","Hello, my name is Ivana Guerrioleca and I'm going to talk about the Pink project, which is for the course of product management. The unsatisfying need. To paint the nails as a model of elegance, style and femininity is at the present of all women. The manicure takes a long time and not all women have it for so long because some students work, study and work, sometimes in improvised events, etc., and they don't have time for a spa or a hairdresser to give them the nails. So there is no portable mechanism of good quality that makes the manicure easy. The most practical, fast and precise strategy of the market. The market is made up of women from 16 to 36 years of age approximately from the economic level of the country, which represents about 30% of the human population. They are modern women and they are very active in social media. They take care of their health, their figure, their image, so the quality for them is a decisive factor when it comes to buying them. These women are more or less fortunate and modern. In competition we have victory of Cigarettes, Unique and Saison. This is because they represent quality, tradition, transcendence, modernity, youth. So they are inside, they satisfy the women inside our meta market, so they would have to do direct competences. About the product, our attributes would be the following. This is a portable app. A product in the form of a pizzeria that facilitates manipulation and pulse. This would have two containers at the ends, in one story the Smalty and the other the Cestonia. And it's called Pink because it means pink and this is a color related to many women. These containers will be found in some extremes and in one will have the smalte to paint the leaves, and in the other will have the tone to make any correction in case the smalte comes out of the unit. The relevant differential would be that the manicure would be much faster and more practical. There would be a simpler manipulation and a correction of pulse errors in case the smalte comes out of the unit. It would be portable and rechargeable. Positioning, we want it to be positioned in the market as the paint and the smalte is more practical and exclusive to the market. The market attributes related to exclusivity only for women and in exclusive places. Feminity only for girls. This quality because we will take care of that it is a very good and exclusive product and practice since it would be a super simple, small, rechargeable and portable device. The price. According to the market evaluation of the competitors, it would have an initial price of more or less 50 soles, the device. And the Malti and the Settong of Rechargables would have more or less 20 soles because these products would also be produced by us. Communication. The message is the promise of support. The message will be to offer the possibility of painting and painting the nails in a more practical way with an exclusive and portable app. The promise offers exclusivity, quality, practicality to our clients. Support will be better technology as well as the application and the ingredients, since the embellishments of the acetone will have very specific ingredients since we want it to be faster than not damaging the nails. The media in which the Pink advertising is broadcast will be television, magazines, like Cosas and Somos, in the streets, universities and the internet. The distribution will be in boutiques and exclusive centers like the Jockey Plaza. Thank you."

Maybe they are a little unprepared for the situation, the club and everything, but the quality is among the best. So we knew it would be hard, it's hard enough. The audience with the result is not satisfied now, but it can be satisfied with the game. Everything is better today. Well, we gave it all, we fought, we didn't train for the last 10 days. It felt like half an hour. We had a will, a will, but nobody was happy to win. We had our chances, we had two or one judges, not one for us, but there is no connection. I am happy with what we showed. We could have been better, but we didn't have the strength. The coach who trained with you, he said that you play better than Poljek and IP. We are not in the final place, we are playing well, we are fighting well, we are not bad. But first, financial situation, the players are falling, the atmosphere is a little bit gloomy, but now new people have arrived, we will fight. But you are facing two difficult situations. Well, this is a very difficult situation, we are going in the middle. We do not have what to lose. We can only get it, we will work hard and give it all to ourselves.

All you need is the main component. You really can't do this without it. It's one of the old eye-touch first-gen holders. It's a little black thing that came in it. Now, this is just the thing if you don't need it anymore. See, I got the new eye-touch and I couldn't find it. and tape is also how you make the design so I really know what you did. Like how you could do it without tape and the soldering iron. Now you don't have to have a soldering iron but it's the best thing to help make cool edges like I'll show you. I actually have this Weller SP23L. It has removable tips right now. I have a tip with a wide flat screw driver. It's the wide one, not the thin one. What you want to do is first take your eye touch case and you want to go on the hole. There will be a hole in the middle. I'll show you in the back on both sides. and you want to take tape and kind of layer it over. Now this is what the tape will look like when you're done. You're going to actually do this on the sheet but I did this and I realized I didn't need it so I peeled it off and used it as an example. I'll show you what you will do. So you can just use any type of tape. You use scotch tape. All you're going to do is say take this much tape put it down like now you're gonna be doing this on your out touch case and you don't want air bubbles but this is just an example and take the next piece of tape you're gonna try to keep them the same size and then put it over so there's just a little gap let me just without holding the camera and I'll show you so I don't know if you can see that but you just put the that second piece of tape a little bit above it over like that and you keep on doing that and and then when you're finished with that, you do that same thing the other way. Again, a little bit over. You kind of want it to be even. I'm holding the camera so I can't do it that even. Again, as you can see, it layers over and stuff. Now I'll be sticking down. Then you want to do that on the other side that you didn't cover the hole on. Then you want to do that over the back of it cross everything and cross over the front and then if you look closely at my camera probably can't show you but there are little squares and stuff in it there are bubbles which aren't exactly perfect but I mean so if you want this really perfect it'll take you about an hour to do it it didn't take me that long but if you want it like and and melt it down. and these things screw off and you want to actually go down and kind of cut through it and make sure you don't cut through the top because then it will look weird on the top and then you want to kind of pull it out I guess like after it's all cut out you want to pop that little piece of tape out it'll be like a chunk of tape kind of and then after you have the whole out, you want to even out the edges. Now what if you want, if you have the patience you can unplug it, let it cool down and unscrew that. If yours can't unscrew just use the edge around there but mine can and I don't want to cool it down. So what I use, you can probably use tongs would be better at first but you just grip it down and turn it. Obviously this isn't the best way to do it. but I mean it works so I use it. Also this may do a little thing like on your tips you may want to scratch that off. I actually have a little pull iron on so you can just scratch it off on the top. But what you want to do now is if you have it like this you just want to take it and rub it inside and kind of smooth it out and you want to do that all over the edges so take this and smooth out all the uneven edges. and then you'll have smooth edges and it's just a cool design. I was just bored and I had this so I made it. You can obviously do other things if you don't have any air. If it's all airtight, you can actually fill the hole up with water and then do the tape design again and kind of solder it on and melt it on really. If you look at the top there will be water flowing through and that will be kind of cool. But I mean that's just optional and it's really hard to make sure there's no leakage at all because when I tried it it was just dripping out and a lot of different places. But this is just a cool design you can do if you have a little extra time. So thanks for watching until my next video. Just remember to rate, comment and subscribe. Bye guys.","Ok, hey guys.

Preocupa-se em enfatizar a condição humana, os sentimentos, as ideias, as emoções e os afetos. Por isso a TV Cultura questionou algumas pessoas dentro do seu cotidiano a respeito do racismo. existe, né? E esse racismo continua hoje ainda fortemente em todo o país, né? Acho que existe, meu, as pessoas de hoje em dia ainda vão tomar consciência de que isso é pura bobeira, cada um é igual a todo mundo. Acho que tem que banir isso, tem que acabar. Todo mundo é igual a todo mundo, não tem que ter diferença. Porque eu sou negro, eu sofro muito disso aí, piadinho e tal. Acho que eu é um indivíduo, se não gosto disso. Já sofreu algum tipo de discriminação? Já, muitas. Muitas pessoas passam correndo os outros, mancadas de negro e falando coisas que a gente não gosta. Você se sente muito mal com isso. Desde suas primeiras constituições, o Brasil adora princípios constitucionais e legislações que proibem a discriminação racial. Até 1988, a discriminação racial era tratada como mera contravenção penal, ou seja, uma prática penal considerada menos grave do que crime. A constituição atual trata a discriminação como crime imprescritível, pode ser punido a qualquer tempo. É inafiançável não se admite que o acusado responde à liberdade.","When addressing the issue of racial relations, look for this part of these situations, that occur around us, that are daily, that occur around us. Don't worry about infatizing the human condition, the feelings, the ideas, the emotions and the affections. That's why TV Cultura questioned some people within its daily life, regarding racism. I think it exists very strongly, because racism is a matter that has been going on for many years, for 500 years, And this racism still remains strong in the whole country. I think it exists, people today don't take conscience that it's all bullshit, everyone is the same. I think we have to ban this and end it. Everyone is the same, everyone has differences. Because I'm black, I suffer a lot from this, and I'm a little bit stupid. I think I'm an idiot, I don't like this. Have you ever suffered any kind of discrimination? Yes, many. Many people run around, black hands, saying things we don't like. We feel bad about it. It can be punished anytime, it is unlawful, it is not advisable that the accused respond freely."

Ага, ми міркуємо на тим, щоб додати кілька лискучих розганяльних смух. Так, Годі, звісно, що ми думали на тим, щоб додати дещо відполяну львоєнергії, бо розганяльні смуги взагалі-то не дають нічого. Вони надають пришвидшення. Пришвидшення? Їнколи я дивуюся, чи ти дійсно науковець. Щоб ви не надумали, ви повинні вкластися у визначений термін. Коли минулого разу не вклалися у визначений термін, то Ви хочете ще 20 зевих хвилин щоден і здивлівці на поверхню? Ні. Ні. Розганяльні смуги. Лабораторія Апертура. Ото ж, згідно з обчисленням ваги та опираючись на маєтник Адамса, а не на власну щільність, це якась маячня. Ну, то поговоримо про додавання розганяльних смуг. Ні. Кашу тобі смуга – це ідеальний варіант. Слухай, я намагаюся трохіти на ризик, але розганяльна смуга. Це просто тупо. Сам тупий. У мене IQ більше 70. Ага. За шкалою тупості. Ха-ха, опця! От що, якщо я вже такий тупий, то може ти допоможе зробити тікляті обчислення. А коли закінчимо, додамор зганяльну смугу. Так, або й дві. І Чарлзе. Лен, це у тебе щось до губи перестало. Дякую. Мені подобається твій халат. Ви почнете через одну хвилину. О, так. Якщо вона проти, це наш тест. Ні, то наш тест. Данерегулювані визначає здатість фотонної гармати опорувати поли мною вої енергії. А на чому ми зупинилися стосовно опорування поли мною вої енергії? Ти що хочеш присвоїти собі нашу ідею опорування поли мною вої енергії? Яка ваша ідея? Ага, так. Розумник. Почекайте, ми ж планували цей тест місяцями. А тепер ви обидва хочете зібрати собі його плоди? Це ми перші таки виміли. Це наша ідея, не мали дурництво. Отина тобі. Близь куча, сексуальна, броста. Привіт, Ленсе, Лео. Здорово. Привіт. Бувай. Гарний халат. Пульт керування. Щоб люди могли самі себе застрілити. Скоро стріл. Пробували. Надто хитромудро. Розганяльні смуги. Певен Ленці Лео вже підхопили твою ідею оперування енергетичним полем, чи ще якусь? Я все одно шукатиму нагоду. Ті невдахи здатньо на все заради перемоги. Хочеш сказати, вони такі невдахи, що можуть переструбнути усіх переможців. Га? Ленсе Лео вже... Тож безсумні, воно змагатися з ними справу не вдох. А ми з тобою поволі пересуваємося до портальної гермати. Кажу тобі, цього разу ми виграємо. Так точно, я тебе запевняю, повір мені. А то ж, цього місяця переможцями серед команд лабораторії стають Лео та Ленс за свої подвійні сині розганяльні смуги, а як альтернативу, подвійні помаранчеві смуги. Отакої, оце швидкість. Дякую. Цю ідею нам підказали міні-холодильники. А тепер стосовно не вдах. Волтере, ти був найгіршим. Маю на увазі найгіршим серед інших найгірших. Побто усіх вас. Того ще раз такі загальні кедвські справи лабораторію F22 тепер буде понижено ще на 5 рівнів. Я про бач мені. Це ти про бач. Зачу вибачати? То я крав твою смачнючу індейчку. Мені так соромно.

Of course, we thought of adding some kind of 0 energy fuel, because explosive weapons don't give anything. They give you a boost. A boost? When you look at it, you're really a scientist. Whatever you think you should put yourself in a deadline. Last time they put themselves in a deadline, they put themselves in a laboratory. You want to spend another 20 minutes of the day looking at the surface? No. No. Racial rashes. Laboratory of the Aperture. So, according to the weight distribution and the operation of the owner of the atom, not on the own property, it's some kind of a rift. So, let's talk about the addition of racial rashes. No. I'm telling you, rashes are the ideal option. Listen, I'm trying to go a little bit to the risk, but racial rashes are a little bit more difficult. It's just stupid. You're stupid. I have more than 70 IQ. Yeah, you're stupid. Haha, a cop! So what? If I'm already so stupid, then maybe you'll help me make the calculation. And when we finish, I'll be able to do the math. Yes! Two. Charles? Len, something stopped in your mouth. Thank you. I like your halat. If you don't mind, this is our test. No, it's our test. This regulation means that the photo-garden is able to operate the field of zero energy. Why did we stop using the field of zero energy? You want to own our idea of the field of zero energy? What is your idea? Yes, a reason. Wait, we planned this test for months. Now you two want to collect your own fruits. This is our idea, you fool. Here you go. That was not our test.

Agora, como está muito próximo, está bem detalhado, bem tático, é uma movimentação que muda, é uma entrada de golpe, então é bem detalhe técnico mesmo para fazer diferença na hora da competição. Bom, a gente aqui tem os espaços do Dojoa, que é onde o pessoal do judô faz o treino específico, que é o solo dos tatamis. A gente tem a sala de força e condicionamento, onde a gente faz um treinamento físico. E temos uma sala de recuperação muscular, onde temos uma banheira de água gelada e uma banheira de água quente, tipo uma ídoro, como se fosse uma espécie de ídoro, uma assagem. A gente já implementou uma plataforma de amortecimento, que ela veio para evitar as lesões recorrentes do esporte por conta do impacto com o solo. O mortecimento ajuda bastante, porque o tatame em si é duro para você cair no início do treino. É gostoso para cair. Hoje temos uma área com um amortecimento dentro dos padrões internacionais envolvidos pela Daniela Polosintra. Tem sido muito bom para o judo brasileiro, inclusive as equipes estrangeiros que tem vindo aqui, como a Espanha, a Pova, a Hungria, e a própria equipe que veio dispensionar para o Campeonato Mundial do Japão. A gente fica sonhando com uma dessas lá em casa. Bom, porque no Brasil, antes a gente tinha que viajar para fora do país para poder ter uma estrutura assim. Pelo menos a gente tem uma aqui do Brasil. E um treino desse é excelente. Uma sala de musculação super boa, um tatame que dá para cá. e que durante a semana, terça, quinta e sábado, nós temos um treino com a técnica Yuko, que é a técnica japonesa contratada pelo Comitê Olímpico Brasileiro, que ela está dando treino específico para os atletas da Seleção Brasileira, residentes no Rio de Janeiro, e que vem para cá para fazer esse aperfeiçoamento técnico durante a semana de treino.

This training, which is happening in the Brazilian Team, is fully supported by the Brazilian Committee. It has been important to bring athletes to the best training infrastructure, two athletes here in the Brazilian Team. The concern with the details, that for a good training, for a good recovery, We are in a very complete way, from the first world we are meeting here, and we are here to support the Olympic Committee. It's well structured, there is a good partner for the athletes. We are now very close, very detailed, very tactical, it's a movement that changes, it's a very detailed and technical entry, to make a difference in the competition. Here we have the Dojoa spaces, where the people of the Dojoa do the specific training, which is the TATAMI's sole. We have the physical training room, where we do physical training, and we have a muscle recovery room, where we have a cold water bath and a hot water bath with a kind of hydro, like a kind of hydro massage. We have implemented a mortising platform, which came to prevent the sports recurrent lesions from impacting the sole. The warm-up helps a lot. The tatami itself is hard to fall in the beginning of the training. It's nice to fall. Today we have an area with a warm-up inside the international standards involved by Daniela Pozinti. It has been very good for the Brazilian team, including the foreign teams that have come here, like Spain, Cuba, Hungary, and the team that came to spend time with the World Cup in Japan. We like this structure a lot. For us, the judo is a reason of pride to have this space here to train with our selection. It's excellent. We dream of one of these at home. Good because in Brazil, before we had to travel out of the country to have a structure like this. At least we have one here in Brazil. And a training like this is excellent. A super good muscle room, a tatami that can be and we can play without any problems. This week is going to be great for us. During this week, Tuesday and Saturday, we have a training with the technique IUCO, which is the Japanese technique, contracted by the Brazilian Olympic Committee, which is giving specific training for the athletes of the Brazilian National Team, in Rio de Janeiro, and which comes here to do this technical perfecting during the training week. The support from the crowd is brilliant for us. It's very positive. If you're fighting in Brazil, it's a little better, but it's nice and it helps a lot. I like to fight at home, I like to fight with the crowd in favor, with people shouting. I get very emotional and it gives me a lot of strength inside. So for me it's great."

Zuruf, das heißt doch eigentlich nur Bravo. Danke, weitermachen, nicht aufgehen. Großartig. Das sind auch die Worte, die mir einfallen. Und so ist auch dieses Denkmal einzigartig. Lieber Peter Eisenmann, ich füge ihn zu. Es ist einzigartig. natürlich wegen seiner Gestaltung. Aber vor allem ist es einzigartig durch seine schiere Existenz. Erinnerung zeugt Erinnerung. Ich spreche hier als einer von sieben Personen, die vor vielen eher allzu vielen Jahren einen Verein beründeten für die Errichtung dieses Denkens. Wir haben das Glück gehabt hauptsächlich durch die unermüdliche Arbeit von Lea Ros. Genügend Freunde für diese Idee zu finden. Das Denkmal steht für uns, dient Erinnerung und fand und findet dafür mit Besucher, weil sie uns je erträumen. Es ist schon öfters darüber gesprochen worden, wir befinden uns in einem Generationenwechsel. Nationalsozialismus, Krieg und organisierter Volk am Mord werden immer weniger lebendige Erfahrung von Zeitzeugen bleiben und immer mehr zur Ereignisse der Geschichte. Sie wechseln von persönlich individuellen, beglaubigter Erinnerung in das durchwissen vermittelte, kollektive Gedächtnis. Doch diese Vermittlungsleistung geschieht nicht von selbst. Sie bedarf konkrete Anstöße, konkrete Angebote eben auch der Orte der Erinnerung. Das möchte ich noch hinzufügen. Das klingt mir noch in Ohren. Das Verwechten ist Willy Brandt. Brand, der gesagt hat, es gebietet die Würde, dass wir ein sichtbares Zeichen setzen in Erinnerung an 6 Millionen ermordete Juden. Und wenn wir das heute sehen, es ist alles nicht so geworden, wie wir uns das vorgestellt haben. Ich habe gedacht, dann geht da hin und es tut weh. Ich sehe jetzt auch spielende Kinder, aber das gehört zu der Realität. Das wichtigste Deutsche Denkmal und das ist heute mehrfach schon gesagt worden, Aber es kann auch nicht oft genug gesagt werden, verdankt seine Existenz einer Bürgerinitiative um Lea Ros und Eberhard Deckel, ihrer Klugheit, ihrer Haartmärkigkeit und ihrer Zivilpourage. Als einsamer Wanderer in Eisenmanns Kunstwerk habe ich die Überraschung erlebt, dass alle Prophezeuerungen am Erlebnis vorbeigegangen waren. Kein bedrohliches, monumentales, verstörendes Labyrinth war das geworden. Stattdessen erlebt man den Gang durch das Feld wie den Weg, durch eine verlassenen Stadt. der dieser Platz mitten im Herzen Berlins gewidmet ist. Deshalb bin ich dankbar, dass dieses Denkmal hier wirklich im Herzen Berlins steht. Aber eine große Bitte habe ich an alle, nein oder an uns alle oder an alle Menschen letztendlich, dass so ein Denkmal nie wieder irgendwo erbaut werden muss, nur irgendwo in der Welt. Leib dem Becher voll mit Wein! Lombe alle lustig sein, verhör los sein, leber dich sein! Hol den wissen weißen Tocker ein! Lombe alle leinem mit einem und schämen sich vor keinem und schämen sich vor keinem! Lombe alle lustig, verhör los sein! Die Frage der Ausstellung ist, ob die Arbeit der Bürgerinitiative und die Arbeit des Förderkreises daraus entwickelt hat. Wir haben viele Archivmaterialien wiederfinden und aufbereiten müssen, wie Sie vorhin im ersten Teil schon sagten, dass wir einen sehr kurzen Prägnal im Schlag nicht gemacht haben, sodass wir einen relativ zügigen, schnellen Einbruch haben. und bekommt über die mtrecht langweilige 20-Jährige und nicht immer so einfache Geschichte dieses Förderkreises. Und der Parkour bildet das in seiner ganzen Führung dann auch ab. Der geht also wirklich um Ecken und hinten her. Wir zeigen dann zusätzlich die Modelle aus dem ist den Zweistiefen des Wettenwerbs und wir zeigen Filmmaterial und die Materialsomit andere Annaleseecke zum Nachlesen, zum Rühnen. Also wir länger Zeit haben, länger Zeit.","The little ones have called the smart events. especially because of his design. But above all, it is unique because of his sheer existence. Reminder, witness, memory. I am speaking here as one of seven people who have founded a association for the creation of this thinking for many, many years. We were lucky, mainly because of the incredible work by Lea Rose, We have enough friends to find this idea. The idea is for us, it serves memories and finds and finds for visitors, because we dream of them. It has been talked about often that we are in a generation change. National Socialism, War and organized people's death will always remain less and less alive experiences of time and more and more to the events of history. They change from personal, individual, believable memory into the memory of the collective memory that was transmitted through knowledge. But this memory power does not happen by itself. It requires concrete attacks, concrete offers, also places of memory. I would like to add that. That sounds like Willy Brandt's memory. The fire that said that the forest was given was a visible sign in memory of 6 million murdered Jews. And if we see it today, it's not all the way we imagined it. I thought, then go there and it hurts. I see now also playing with children, but that belongs to reality. The most important German monument, and that is already said several times today, but it can also not often be said enough, thanks to its existence, a citizen initiative about Léa Rose and Eberhard Jekyll, their cliqueness, their stubbornness and their civil courage. As a single wanderer in Eisenmann's art work, I was surprised that all the prophecies had passed through the experience. It was not a threatening, monumental, disturbing labyrinth, but instead you experience the passage through the field like the road When the sun was shining and you were walking over the field, everything turned into an art work of light and shadow. No stone looked like the other. The field seemed to breathe and to wave. I believe that everyone has the same experience at every visit. You lose all the time when walking around and the thoughts are open for the way out of the present. the long-term place in the heart of Berlin. That's why I'm grateful that this monument is really in the heart of Berlin. But I have a big request to all of you. No, or to all of us, or to all of the people, that such a monument must never be rebuilt again, in the world. The Becher is full of truth! Long live the fun! Be free! Be happy! Get the white t-shirt! Long live all the lads! The lads are missing! Long live the fun! Be happy! Be happy! Be happy! Be happy! The sad topic is the background of the exhibition itself. The work of the mayor and the work of the press. We have made 8 copies of the first idea of the exhibition. The goal was to keep the future of the project as a whole. and not always so simple history of this front-end. And the parkour forms that in its entire lead, it really goes around corners and back. We then show the models from which the two stages of the competition are. And we show film material and other material, but also other reading corners for the near reading, for the green. So we have a longer time, a longer time. Thank you."

Buiten klein, binnen groot, dat gaan jullie zo zien. Waar een kleine kunst groot kan zijn en een groot kunst klein. We hebben een trainiën in de karoën, die camera's aan de trainiën heeft en het schijnt de foto straks naar de speciaal. Dus je hebt meer artiesten in je boethen, zo te zeggen. Nee, de artiesten zijn allemaal in de karoën en zijn sameld samen door de camera. Dus je bent een miniholiday curatier. Dat is correct, dat is onze museum. Deze mannen die het hebben gemaakt. En ik zeg maar K3, want K3, dat heeft bij ons in Nederland en België een heel andere betekenis. We kennen natuurlijk de zangeres zonder naam, de band zonder naam, maar artist zonder naam. Verklaar u nader, artist anonymous? Ze heet artist anonymous omdat ze nooit zeggen wie wat maakt. Ja, want wie toong jij allemaal? En waarom hangt dat schilderijsgeef? Dat hoort zo omdat het klauw is. Goed zo. Laar poelaar, zeg maar. Hebben jullie de partij hier? Dan ga ik mijn favoriete tunis voor jou spelen. die ergens anders staat te hoeren, want dat is helemaal kunst, de boel moet toch verkocht worden. Maar deze plaatje willen jullie MvS-kijkers niet nalaten om te laten zien. Maar ondanks al deze fabelis artiesten ben je inmiddels weggekocht door Norwegen. Hoe zit dat? Ik ben begonnen aan mijn masteropleiding daar in het Verrenoorden. Oké, en waar ga je op afstuderen? De installaties, eh? Oh, dit is even fijn. En vice versa. Dit is... En dan zijn we er. Ze komt gewoon uit de plek. Ja, niet een afrikaanse mask. Gewoon normaal papier. Karen, hoe ben je? Ik ben er wel. Wat ben je ervan geïnteresseerd over? Doe je voel en boesten? Ja. En zo moet je. Dat was woest dat ze niet was opgehaald en gelijk heeft ze. We staan hier met de vrouw waar het allemaal ondraait. Namelijk Nusvaas van showroomama. Dit is jouw geestenskindje toch? Dit is wel mijn projectje. Ja, dat klopt. Met veel enthousiasme hebben we dit in de wereld gezet. Ik heb geen nadigheid kunnen bespeuren, alleen maar positieve reacties. Ja, ik ben heel blij dat de pers positief is. Ik word gebeld door Gallerie House, maar Arth Rotterdam van tot hoe laat ze jullie open willen komen kijken. Zelfs de Volkskrant was vol of? Nou, de Volkskrant heb ik best wel anderhalf uur mee bezig geweest. Dus de delegat vond ik iets positiever. Ja, maar je begrijpt wat ik bedoel natuurlijk. Ja, ik begrijp wat je bedoelt. Mensen, ik dacht dat ik de enige puntmuts was vanavond, maar er is er nog een. Ik weet niet of we daar terecht kunnen. Zullen we het eens even vragen? En daar gaan we mensen omhoog. Dit is gewoon eten op hoog niveau. Dit kan de allerlaatste reputatiescijf van MvS mensen genieten van. Toofloors open, mixed crowd, drie Euries entrée en ja ik heb er heel wat in gevlogen. Erik die Clark hebben einde luk uit Berlijn. Zouden we anderhalf jaar geleden zouden we hem al hebben. Bekend van From Disco to Disco. Een top hit en natuurlijk Karen Geely. En een heel klein meisje met een scheur!","Dear viewers of the MvS, today we are from Rotterdam, where we have gone with the open source to give you a message about the Project Art Fair. Outside small, inside big. You will see that. Where a small art can be big and a big art small. K3, from Zurich We know the singer without a name, the band without a name, but artist without a name. Explain yourself. Artist anonymous. They call artist anonymous because they never say who makes what. Who do you all know? And why do I give that painting? That's because the clown is. They are very nice people. They never say who did what. They are very nice people. They are very nice people. They are very nice people. They are very nice people. They are very nice people. They are very nice people. Are you all coming to the party tonight? Of course! Then I'm going to sing my favorite tunes for you. Oh God. Oh, it looks hideous. I know. That is of course somewhere else to hoorate, because that is art. The ball must be sold. But we want to show you this record, not to let you see it. But despite all these fabulous artists, you are now sold out by Norway? How is that? I started at my master's in the Far North. Where are you going to study? The installations. Unforgettable installations. With the big C. Oh no, we're all the way from California. So Los Angeles? This woman has hit the very first house. The reason she is so weird is because she always has a mask on. So it's not that the woman is dressed up or something like that. She comes from the right side of the ship. We are here with the woman who is playing the role of Nusfaz of showroom mama. This is your girlfriend, right? This is my project. With a lot of enthusiasm we have put this in the world. I have not been able to predict anything, only positive reactions. I am very happy that the press is positive. I'm calling the gallery house, but I'm not sure how long they will be open. Even the folks were full of love. I've been busy for about 1,5 hours. I liked the telegraph. I understand what you mean. I thought the only point was tonight. I don't know if we can go there. Shall we ask them? Can we come to you? The security measures are taken in 8. I am being held in the door with this too dangerous project that I am going to do now. And there we go people, up high. This is just food at a high level. This can be the last number of interviews for M.V.S. people. Enjoy it. I have flown in a lot. Eric and Clark have finally got out of Berlin. Would we have had that two and a half years ago? Known from From Disco to Disco. A top hit. And to Karen Geely. But you're just, he has a sound that... Oh, yeah, that's...

Do you know I think we've all made peace with that in a way. There are so many things to enjoy being part of this whole series of films most of all the affection of the fans and the fact that there's a global community Follow these stories with great passion. If you go down to Trafalgar Square right now you'll see a mini-glastonbury of people from all over the world who've been camping out in the rain for the last three nights. And that's more of a compensation than lots of trophies, so I think we're cool about that. That's somehow more important, I'd say. I don't think there are more Harry Potter fans and Harry Potter readers. These books are just so loved and the fans of these books books were the most discerning critics and the fact that they've really embraced the series that we made and there are pretty much no complaints. Everyone seems to really love and think they're true to that. I just don't think there's any better reward than that than that we satisfied them."

In questo momento davanti alla villa e dentro il Parco Galvani si stanno chiudendo tutte le opere relative al grande giardino, al grande rosetto che come state vedendo è in corso proprio di piantumazione con i nuovi percorsi, la pulizia del laghetto e quant'altro. E' chiaramente adesso lo vedete così, appena piantumato con ancora il traccio della grande pioggia di questi giorni, ma immaginate-lo in primavera che spettacolo straordinario sarà. Davanti alla villa e alla nuova galleria vedete questo grande uola con tutti i tipi di rose anche qui, la parte iniziale del percorso delle rose. Dentro la villa, sia nella parte La grande mostra di Cali e del suo Magistero, di tutti questi grandi artisti che dagli anni 30 in poi hanno accompagnato la vita di questo grande maestro italiano che è stato Cali. Adesso in anteprima andremo a vedere come stanno allestendo questa grande mostra che prenderà il via sabbra. Eccoci all'interno del nuovo corpo di fabbrica di questa straordinaria costruzione, questo è il primo spazio spositivo, come vedete sta già iniziando l'allestimento, ci sono ancora una serie di lavori che sono in corso, i grandi pannelli di cagli delle spodi parigi giapponese, posizionati in alcune loro parti, in allestimento la grande fontana, la copera, la grande fontana con tutti i segni zodiacali, una mostra come vi dicevo che si pronuncia assolutamente straordinaria per quanto riguarda l'Italia e per quanto riguarda il panorama internazionale. Adesso scendiamo al piano sottostante dove continua La parte dedicata a Cagli. Eccoci al piano sottostante, stessi spazi naturalmente. Come vi dicevo già nell'altra servizia, la galeria d'arte moderna ha due spazi espositivi piano terra e sottopiano, identici e poi tutti gli spazi espositivi nella vecchia villa Galvani. Mentre, sopra abbiamo visto che già avevamo già a un buon grado di allestimento qui sono sostattati posizionati, i quadri devono essere ancora scelta la modalità con cui verranno esposti da parte dei curatori, questi ultimi tre giorni ci sarà appunto tutto questo lavoro. Come vedete una quantità d'opera incredibile, saranno circa 200 o 240, se non ricordo male le opere in mostra. Adesso appunto andiamo a vedere la parte dedicata a tutti questi amici o allievi di Cagli parte che è allestita appunto come vi dicevo nella villa galvani quindi nel vecchio corpo di fabbrica qui ci siamo nel raccordo tra il vecchio e il nuovo corpo di fabbrica stiamo per accedere appunto alla villa vedete che qui iniziano già ad essere presenti una serie di sculture bellissime questa è una scultura di dino basaldella pieno delle opere dei fratelli basaldella, sculture, quadri cose anche note molto notte, abbiamo visto molte volte nei nostri musei, nelle nostre gallerie e però ogni volta queste opere ci emozionano in modo straordinario eccoci anche al primo piano della villa anche qui vedete in corso di allestimento con tutti questi grandi maestri che ci permetteranno di fare anche un confronto con l'opera di Cagli e l'opera di questi allievi appunto amici e che disegnano anche un percorso e un periodo della storia dell'Italia che è quella del primo dopo guerra e secondo dopo guerra quindi un periodo molto lungo della nostra vita della nostra vita della nostra del nostro paese. Infine eccoci nel in questo ambiente cosi molto racchiuso dove saranno esposti i disegni di Cagli quindi un'altra ancora espressione del suo essere artista qui ancora tutto in fase di allestimento ma come vedete anche in questo luogo veramente molte opere che verranno esposte proprio a completare l'insieme dell'operare di Cagli e dei e di vari artisti. una città si può fare cultura, si può fare sport, si può fare economia, c'è la necessità per un capoluogo di riconoscersi anche attraverso le opere e poi nei contenuti. Una grande mostra proprio a significare che Pordenone è al centro dei vari processi culturali della Regione Fluori Venezia Giulia del nord-est e dell'Italia intera proprio proponendo eventi culturali di un livello veramente elevato. Vi aspetto sabato alle 17 di inaugurazione iniziale ma già dalle 16 saranno aperte le porte della nuova galleria d'arte moderna, Armando Pizzinato, Parco, Pordenone, Arte Contemporanea, qui a Villa Galvani e vi aspettiamo numerosi perché questa è un'opera che appartiene a tutti noi, a tutti noi Pordenone dobbiamo essere orgogliosi, dobbiamo far capire a tutti che una città cresce attraverso le opere, i contenuti, ma attraverso anche l'orgoglio di appartenere a una comunità che è una comunità viva, che ha a cuore tutti i suoi cittadini.","Four days before the inauguration of the new Art Modern Gallery, the Parco Porte Non e Arte Contemporanea, all the last 20 people are working. At this moment, in front of the village, inside the Parco Galvani, all the works are being closed relative to the great garden, the great garden that, as you can see, is in the course of planting, with the new routes, the cleaning of the garden and so on. You can see it now, just plumped with the track of the rain of these days, but imagine it in spring, which an extraordinary spectacle will be. In front of the villa and the new gallery you see this great Uola with all types of roses, also here the initial part of the path of the roses. Here we are inside the new factory body. This is the first space. As you can see, the assembly has already begun. There are still a series of work to be done. The large panels of wood from the expo of Paris, already in the past. in the exhibition, the big fountain with all the zodiacal signs, a monster that is absolutely extraordinary for the Italian and international views. Now we go to the underground floor where it continues to be the most beautiful Here we are at the underground space, the same space as I said before, in the other services, the gallery has two spaces, the underground and underground space, the same as the old Galvanic Villa. The paintings must be selected again, with which they will be exhibited, by the curators. In the last three days there will be all this work. As you can see, an incredible amount of works will be more than 200 or 240, if I remember correctly, the works in Mostra. Now let's go and see the part dedicated here we are in the old building full of the works of the Basaldella brothers, sculptures, paintings, things, also very nightly nights, we have seen many times in our museums, in our galleries, but every time these works make us emotional in an extraordinary way. Here we are also at the first floor of the village, here you can also see in the course of the workshop with all these great masters, that will allow us to make a comparison with the work of Cali and the work of these allies and friends and that also designates a journey and a period of the history of Italy, which is the first after the war and the second after the war, so a very long period of our life, of our country. This is the site of the villa in this very closed environment where the drawings of the cagli are exhibited. Another expression of his being an artist. Here everything is still in the stage of the exhibition. But as you can see, also in this place, there are many works that will be exhibited. We finished this short tour. We wanted to give you this first impression of this extraordinary opening and of the museum in its entirety. The fact that Porte None gives us a new and great exhibition seat because a city of capoluogo needs to be recognized in symbolic places and therefore to have the certainty that in the In a city you can do culture, sports, economy, there is a need for a capuloi to recognize itself through the works and then in the contents. A great display to mean that it is not in the center of the various cultural processes of the FIJ region of the Northeast and of the entire Italy, proposing and cultural events of a really high level. I expect you Saturday at the 17th of the initial inauguration, but already from the 16th they will open the doors of the new gallery of modern art, of a very high level cultural events. I expect you Saturday at the 17th of the first inauguration, but since the 16th of the beginning, but from the 16th they will open the doors of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of the new art gallery of We must be proud and make everyone understand that a city grows through the works and the contents, but also through the pride of belonging to a community that is a living community, a community that has all its citizens."

Jeg er hjert Brie Nielsen, og i dag skal vi have om genforening med Sønder Jylland i 1920. Vi har i dag samlet to eksperter, som vil fortælle os om genforeningen og komme lidt mere inden noget, hvordan det skete osv. Men endelig med det har vi også fundet to vinder, som har oplevet det. Og nu vil jeg gerne byde velkommen til aftenens første ekspert. Her kommer han. Han hedder Gunnar Thorsten. Du har jo lovet at fortælle os lidt om genforhjulningen i 1920 med Søllergøland. Og hvordan det skete? Sproglige set var området blandet mellem tyske og danske. Statrendelige set påpare man for dansk side, at Hertrubdømd's Lesvig var et gange dansk lend. Mens man fra tysk side var imod alle forsøg på at knytte Lesvig tættere til kongen røde. Indeling af Lesvig var allerede dengang forslået, men af begge parter i Lesvig blev det afvist. Det er her i aften. Kan du godt gøre det godt? Ja. Nu vil vi gerne bidt velkommen til aftenens første vide, og hun kommer her. Hun hedder Reemor Christensen. Du har jo oplevet genforening, og jeg må behege de historie. Ja, det hedder vi godt. Altså, jeg havde tapt de tre her, her, Tueslaysvi og Lauffinborg, det synes bl. i 1864. Men mange af os, som boede i Grænsen, ville føle sig stadig som danskere. Altså, jeg kan tydeligt huske, at Utefres, vi var. Hvordan min far, han stod så hårdt i bordet, at min mor blev rød og øret, og vi andre blev som i tidligst i sent. Altså, fordi efter første verdenskrig, så skulle du lære os at fredagsret tale om, hvor Grænsen skulle gå. Og, der var tre zoner. Der var Nord-Slesvig, det var første zone. Så var der Mendeslesvig, og så var der en zone, mellem Mendeslesvig og en, de 19. Efter vi har stemt, så har I første zone Bød-Dansk, og de andre to zoner havde tysk fjertal. Det var forstående at slæse vi Holsten og Blauborgen i 1864 efter kring der. Det var til Stortmark, der blev Preussen og Østrig. Det gjorde, at der var mange andre dansstalende og danske køkke, der kom til at høre hjemme i Tyskland, hvor de jo ringte faktisk bare danskere. Det var jo ikke særlig godt, fordi de var jo danskere. Men efter første verdenskrig, hvor Tyskland de tattede eller de... Det gik ikke så godt for dem, så skete der nogle ting, som så gjorde, at danskere ikke kunne konspere. Det gør, at Danmark fik det at sønne i land tilbage, som selv mener, de var danske. og så kom der nogle konferenter og så blev Versajtrakteren, som var en fredsttrakter og så konkreterede den sine intor Sønland og det var så Danmark der fik Sønland tilbage. Ja, in i intiiv. Det var meget spændende. Tak. Du er da jo kommet. Det var du. Vi ses. Vi ses. Her i aften, han er selv der med til at opleve krigen og han kommer her. Han hedder Olof Mellberg. Vi har jo lige hørt at du har jo været med. Du har oplevet krigen og senere din, det var selv der bare. Ja. Der er måske ikke så mange der ved det i dag, men mange unge men inklusiv mig selv blev tvænget i krigen som tydsøddag under første verdenskrig. I dag kan jeg godt fortælle om mine oplevede så under første verdenskrig, men i mange år har jeg kun snakket om det, da jeg skammer med overhåret og kæmpe for tyskerne. Selvom det bare var noget, der blev tvænget i krig. Det var grusom, de brugte jo som kanonfæde. Rigtig mange af mine gode kammerater, de mistede led på slagmarken. Og skødtegravene, de var så forfærdelige, at jeg engang kan beskrive dem. Det var heldig overhovedet at overleve, for vi blev nemlig ramt af et skud, da franskemændene angrippes. Jeg løb med smærtere i flere timer og besvinde til sidst. Jeg var dog heldig, at der var nogen, der kom og bregge mig på hospital. Patruren som jo ikke opererede ud. har jeg stadig stadig den dag i dag og den minnermem hvor heldig jeg var. Og det var hvad du havde været om siden. Ja, det var det jeg havde. Okay, super. Mange tak, Olof. Kan du komme med at lide? Ja. Det var så alt hvad vi havde i dag. Vi håber, at i alle samme nødvide og jeg vil have blivet lidt klogere på genforening i 1920 med Sønøjelat. Vi ses næste gang i Rådpræsoren. Time to blow the hand dynamo, no more disappearing Act, I know you miss beyond this","Good evening and welcome to the Red Army Story. I am your host, Brian Nelson, and today we will talk about the Genn-Foreign with Sønder Jylland in 1920. Today we have gathered two experts who will tell us about the Genn-Foreign and how it happened. But that is not enough, we have also found two people who have experienced it. And now I would like to welcome the first expert of the evening. He is called Gunner Thorsten. You have been told a little about the GIF in 1922. And how it happened. Can you tell us about it now? Good evening, can you do it well? Now we would like to welcome Afton's first white woman, and she comes here, her name is Reemor Christensen. You have experienced the transformation, and I must hear your story. Yes, that's what we do. I had, or you had, lost the three here, Hurtus, Laysvi and Laughinburg, especially in 1864. Many of us lived in the border, we felt like Danish. I can clearly remember how my father lived so hard, my mother and I were growing up, and we were both very old. After the First World War, you could learn to talk about where the border was going. There were three zones. There was the North Sea, the first zone. There was the Middle Sea, and there was the Zone between the Middle Sea and the New West. After we voted, the first zone was Danish, and the other two had German houses. The Germans were fighting against the Holsteins and Blauensburg in 1864. It was the great power of the Prussian and Austrian. There were many other Danish and Danish people who came to Germany, where they were actually Danish. That was not bad, because they were Danish. But after the First World War, where Germany lost, it didn't work out for them. The president of the Udvara-Wildsson-Denamkanen, he wrote a 14-page article, which made that the national minority could vote for themselves, where they would like to meet. And that made Denmark get their own country back, even though they were Danish. And I also have a newspaper that can show you. Here you can see there was a war in 1864, and then there were negotiations in 1918, And then there was a conference And then there was the Versailles-traktage which was a Christmas-traktage And then specifically the 10th of September in the Netherlands And that was the Denmark that got the Netherlands back in the 20s It was very exciting Thank you very much You are welcome That was great See you See you See you Thank you And now I would like to welcome our second white He is here tonight, he is with us to experience the war and he is coming here, he is called Olaf Melbert. We have just heard that you have been with us, you have experienced the war and your opinion is just... Yes. There may not be many who know it today, but many young men including myself have been forced into a war like the German today during the first world war. Today I can tell you my experience during the first world war, but in many years I have not been able to talk about it, since the scams of the war have been fought by the Germans. Even if it was just something to be said. It was cruel, they used to feed the cannon. Many of my good comrades lost their lives on the slaughter market. The shooting was so dangerous that I could not even write them. It was a hell of a hell of a life, because it was so hard to shoot when the French attacked us. I was in pain for several hours and fainted last. I was lucky that there were people who came and brought me to the hospital. The patrol was mostly operated on. I'm still in that day and my mom was so happy. And that's what you had to say. That's what I had. Okay, great. Many thanks, Olof. Can you give me a hand? Yes. That's all we had today. We hope that we all have a good time and that we will be a little bit more happy about the 2019 GEN4-Union. See you next time in the next episode. Time to blow the hand dynamo, no more disappearing, I know you miss me, I miss you"

In the event of a disaster you lose so much confidence and to have someone there rooting you on immediately after something like that happens is it's such a vital piece of your recovery and being able to able to meet those immediate needs like the Red Cross does is one of the most important stepping stones on the way to recovery.

Through point and click app-based control of automated camera behaviors, the Ranger will provide unparalleled functionality. By simply dragging the desired icon onto the camera image, a series of preset controls are automatically installed. For example, the Weather Preset app accesses real-time weather data for the camera location, with access to up-to-the-minute weather radar, the user can easily select the appropriate preset for current weather conditions to optimize the forward-looking infrared imagery. With a single click of the mouse or a touch of a finger, the ideal camera settings are instantly loaded to provide the highest quality image possible in any weather condition. For a hands-off response, the camera can be set to automatically interpret the supplied weather data and choose the appropriate preset for the indicated weather conditions. When the end user drags the Dust Dawn app onto the camera image, date-specific sunrise and sunset times for the camera location are loaded into camera memory.

Hacer la historia de un pueblo es desarrollar la evolución de suspente. más allá de su geografía. Hacer la historia de Quilmes es remontarnos al desarrollo histórico de nuestros primeros pobladores, los pueblos Quilmes y Acalianos.

Kilmes is a people who has given us toponymy and gentleness, that is, it gave its name to this city and its people. And I say, they are, because they still persist, descendants, in the valley of Yocabil in Tucumán, and here we are Kilmes. Making the history of a people is developing the evolution of its people. beyond its geography. Making the history of Quilmes is to return to the historical development of our first settlers, the Quilmes and Acaleans. With the arrival of the Spanish of these lands, they began a flesh-carnished resistance that lasted 130 years and would go through history with the name of Guerras Calchiqués. On September 2, 1666, a group of Acaleans, a partiality, and associated with the killings that had been sent to the city of Steca, they rise against the Spaniards and return to the Valley of Jocabil. But, unpaid, atrocious and defeated, some snow-covered serfs were removed, dividing them into families and resolved to die, they threw from the graves the mothers of their breasts to their children, preferring to pay with their lives their tavern. Again, they were forced to give them and the mother earth accompanies us with life so that our things and you can see our lives. Kilmes, a town's biography. In our first chapter, why do we call Kilmes? Its history, its culture, its people. From May 3 to Friday through educational connections. How did it happen and how did Kilmes become a deeply impulsive party in the area? A story of more than three centuries. This program aspires to provide a global view of the history of Kilmes. Its customs, the places of origin, a place where they transited their first inhabitants, their institutions. Closing to our barbaric procees, women and men who without marble or bronze made this district great. A people who does not know their history is a people without identity."

You have to wait for the car to be able to do what it can do. You can force it to do so. Off the brake, roll in no power. Tighten it up a little bit. Now, what happened there was you did everything right. Just get going. Let's get going. Yep. You did everything right. Barring, just tightening the lock a little bit. And it just skipped the rear a little bit. So what we needed to do was just keep that steering dead steady. Let this other radical through. Just give him an indicate so he knows he can go by. That's it and all yours. All yours, yeah? So obviously the rear on this is quite susceptible, yeah? So we need to put a tiny bit of power on to set all the rear as we go past the apex, yeah? But no harm done. Roll out to there, this is your life, okay? Power, where we going? Nice spin though. Well caught. You nearly had it, you nearly had it. That didn't upset your spin, you're going on. Because if smooth and accurate is in place, you will be quick anyway, yeah? If you try and force to be quick then you tend to find that you go offline and you're not so accurate and it A becomes wilder and B becomes less, less quick. Nice and steady, that's good Joe. Lovely. What a glorious day, are you drinking plenty of water? When I booked I looked at the weather, it was pouring and then a week later it changed to sunshine. Fantastic, we're lucky. here was another organization and it we didn't go on track it was rained so heavily it was totally flooded full power all the way out full power come right come right you want this little lock on as possible on a way you go I look ahead at your apex there that's the lovely much better throttle control than before before you're going power and it was too much it was lifting the front end up and putting you into understeer so initial application of throttle should be very very gentle yes this is tucking it in and across right across the car that's it and left that's it so now we look for the apex ready there it is so we're in and I know you can't do it properly with all these cars here but... I drive looking at the white lines. So now I'm looking at the right and the white lines to take me over there. I'm looking at the beginning of the curve for turning. It may go. Wait till you're straight before you brake. Handbrake, then one of you. Up brakes, turn it. Back on power. Handbrake, turn it. Yeah, but any more brakes, that's enough. Now ready, brakes, hard. Turn it. And back on power. And swing left, swing left. And full power. That's it, lovely. Swing right, swing right. Let it use the weight. You feel it light when you do the buckle. If you do the felb lighter, That's because it's less friction, more speed, catering. At this point this is fine. This is not unacceptable, especially with a quick driver. If it's someone who's obviously not a quick driver then don't get that close. But just hang on, he'll go through, we'll do the next one, yeah? Because otherwise it'll be a bit too close. Tuck it in tight, this is it, you're on the right line. Just wait for it to run across. I know we're quite close and now swing out left, that's it, and power. Just get ready to go by, look for your apex there, in me go. Ready to go by him, there you go. There we go. Brakes in, we go back on power gently. Build it up, full power. Come on power, that's it. Add a cross, turn in, and swing out towards the right. Bring on the power, and point it back. Handbrake, power brake, down in we go. Keep braking, keep braking, keep braking. Off brake, turn in. You're not too much of a lock on, because if you have the steer, you put more lock on, it is something drips, it's going to spin you. Swing right, that's it. Stay right, look ahead to your right, make a turn. Turn, turn. That's it, just gently keep it going, keep it going and full power, lovely. Great, there's a huge change from last time, right? You're not making power nearly as much. Remember if it goes understeer, don't put lots of brakes and more brakes on because it's going to be wider. You've got to stay close, come right and then you're certainly a load quicker than him. Anticipate your gear changes a little bit earlier, a little bit later, swing left. There's a lot of lock on, don't put lots of power in. Otherwise it's not the real thing. the rear wheels will light up, so left of the wheel is going away from the front. Look at the lights on the rear, but you did the right thing, you took the lock off a bit and extended the slightly wide line. That was okay, that was fine. And then we could move to the second one, trying to get a dead straight line there. So in that way, don't follow him because he's going too far right. Now we go in and look.","That's it.

And it just skipped the rear a little bit. So what we needed to do was just keep that steering dead steady. Let this other radical through. Just give him an indicate so he knows he can go by. That's it, and all yours. All yours, yeah? So obviously the rear on this is quite susceptible, yeah? So we need to put a tiny bit of power on to set all the rear as we go past the apex. Yeah? But no harm done. Roll out to there, this is your life, okay? Power, where we going? Nice spin though. Well caught. You nearly had it, you nearly had it. That didn't upset your spin, you're going on. Because if smooth and accurate is in place, you will be quick anyway, yeah? Nice and steady, that's good, Joe. Lovely. What a glorious day, are you drinking plenty of water? When I booked I looked at the weather, it was pouring and then a week later it changed to sunshine. here was another organization and it we didn't go to track it was rained so heavily it was totally flooded full power all the way out, full power, come right, come right, yeah? You want this little lock on as possible, run away you go. I look ahead at your apex there, that's the lovely, much better throttle control than before. I thought you were going power, but it was too much, it was lifting the front end up and putting you into understeer. So initial application of throttle should be very, very gentle, yes this is, tuck it in and across, right across the car, that's it and left, that's it. So now we look for the apex, ready, there it is, so we're in. do it properly with all these cars here but... I drive looking at the white lines so now I'm looking at the right and white lines to take me over there and look at the beginning of the curve for turning it may go wait till you're straight before your brake and brake then one of you off brakes turn it back on power and brakes turn it yeah but any more brakes that's enough now ready brakes hard turn it and back on power and swing left swing left and full power that's it lovely swing right swing right let it use the weight you feel it lighten when you do the buckle That's because it's less friction, more speed, catering. At this point this is fine, this is not unacceptable, especially with a quick driver. If it's someone who's obviously not a quick driver then don't get that close. But just hang on, he'll go through, we'll do the next one, yeah? Because otherwise it'll be a bit too close. Tuck it in tight, this is it, you're on the right line. Just wait for an across. I know we're quite close and now swing out left, that's it, and power. Just get ready to go by, look for your apex there, in me go. Ready to go by him, there you go. There we go. Brakes in, we go back on power gently. Build it up, full power. Come on power, that's it. Add a cross, turn in and swing out towards the right. Bring on the power and point it back. Handbrake, power brake, down in we go, in we go. Keep braking, keep braking, keep braking. Off brake, turn in. You're not too much of a lock on because if you have the steer, you put more lock on, it is something drips, it's gonna spin you. Swing right, that's it. Stay right, you go ahead and get your apex turned. Turn, turn. That's it, just gently keep it going, keep it going and full power, lovely. Great, there's a huge change from last time, right? You're not making power nearly as much. Remember if it goes understeer, don't put lots of brakes and more brakes on because it's going to be wider. You've got to stay close, come right and you're certainly a load quicker than him. Anticipate your gear changes a little bit earlier, a little bit later, swing left. There's a lot of lock on, don't put lots of power in, otherwise it's going to be a real mess. Now we go in and look"

Eu acho que seria a atitude mais imediata. de 600, é gratuita desde 2008, faz parte do Plano de Saúde Nacional. O vírus do papilo momano, transmite-se por via sexual, é o grande causador do cancro do colo do outro.

For the specialists of the North American Academy of North American Academy of Pediatrics, it is only possible to see the virus in the young people's mind if it is possible to see the virus in the young people's mind before the sexual activity is possible. The ideal would be to have all the adults vaccinated. The ideal would be to have the vaccinated boys and girls, with a theoretical perspective and general health. The other perspective here is that we have to have a sensitive attitude regarding what should be accepted. Some studies show that the most important thing is to have a positive attitude. I think this is a relatively sensitive perspective. In the initial phase, we have to implement a 100% perspective in relation to vaccinating women. I think it would be a more immediate attitude. The Health General also agrees that the vaccination arrangement for the boys is a good idea, but it is not a priority for the country's economic situation. It is free from 2008, it is part of the National Health Plan. The Moman Papilla virus, transmitted by sexual violence, is the great cause of the cancer of the other's neck. For years there are 909 cases of this type of carcinoma that kills in the middle of a woman per day in Portugal. In the boys, the virus can cause infections, an anal and throat infection."

Шум капель, разбивающихся обо всё, что стоит на улице, то затихал, то угрожающе усиливался. Такая неопределённость тормозила процесс решения серьёзного вопроса. Выползать из под одеяло или нет? Хотя время завтрака уже прошло. Вот в таких условиях готовим к отправке материал для составления и Вернёмся в интернет. Дима, как база называется? Усадьба Ярцевых. На базе усадьбы Ярцевых в поселке Катунь. Мы, в общем, добрались сюда. Мы понимали, что наша остановка здесь – это кратковременное явление. Правда была надежда, что успеем до обеда покататься на конях или сплавиться на равте. Но куски голубого неба растворялись в серые раунды. массе облаков с защитанные секунды. Как только появилось сухое окно, решили упаковать вещички и рвануть дальше. Патрин, ваш экипаж готов? Наш готов, наш уже собак, почти за рулем. Сети готовы. В общем мы продолжаем путешествии, еще 300 километров нас ожидают, хотя сегодня уже были слезы по поводу того, что давайте здесь останемся, здесь смотрите, так хорошо, комфортно, но погода делает свое дело и говорит дальше, дальше за семинский перевал, Сюда кипят, в домиках оставаться нет смысла. Я тоже думаю, что мы туристы, что ли? Поехали. И стоило только сесть в машины, как снова полил дождь. Что за ерунда? Неужели Алтай нас не хочет принять? Надо срочно что-то придумать, чтобы духи стали к нам более благосклонны. Пока наши машины прились друг за другом сквозь мутную завесу дождя, меня одолели. и не мучить наших детей переездами с места на место. И вот что по этому поводу мне пришло в голову. У садьбоярцевых это лишь одна из бесконечного числа баз расположенных на протяжении многих километров вдоль Катунни. Там почти как и везде организована одна кухня на все домики, где можно высказать свои пожелания при заказе питания. Меню вроде бы обширная, но довольно стандартная. Предлагается довольно стандартный набор развлечений, экскурсии по стандартным местам и затоптанным тропинкам. Одним словом, место популярное. Такая общая туристическая зона, куда приезжает большинство людей. Ведь многие считают, что вполне достаточно доехать до поселков Монжерок, Катунь, Майма, Усть-Сима или Чимал, разместиться на одной из таких бас, и этого как бы достаточно, чтобы побывать в Алтай. И вот какая приятная мысль начала греть душу. А ведь наши семьи способны променять тепло и уют в домиках, на романтику в палатках. Ведь именно возможность приготовить еду на горелках или костре, проснуться утром в теплом спальнике свернувшись колачикам, умыться водой не из-под крана, а просто из ручья. Вот в таких небольших трудностях и заключается суть любого настоящего путешествия. А у нас оно семейное, значит есть отличная возможность отцу семейства полноценно проявить мужские качества. А мамочки показать свою искреннюю заботу о детях. В общем, я очень надеялся, что все это Ожидает нас впереди. Такие мысли подбадривали и вселяли уверенность. И отмените эту поездку, это путешествие. Мы, конечно, жалеем об этом. Но здоровье превыше всего. Приняли решение оставить ее дома, и вот теперь приходится с ней созвание, а вот с временем отправлять ММС, ки фотографии по почте. В общем, как-то поддерживать связь, чтобы ее ощущение как будто она тоже с нами путешествует. Весота 1715 метров над уровнем моря. Здесь нас очень неприветливо встретила погода. Пока Дмитрий читал информацию про перевал и смотрел, в каких направлениях находятся известные мировые столицы, его синишка Максим нашёл огромный гранитный камень, на котором лежало множество монет. Старший патрин предложил устроить монетный баскетбол. Не просто положить монетку, а бросить с нескольких метров так, чтобы она осталась на камне. При этом все сформировали мысленное намерение. Пусть придёт ясное, Символ мудрости, рыбка. Звучит шикарно, мне нравится. что-то очень одно решившееся. Прямо в смысле упиралось в цветное карамызло. Мы очень обрадовались тому, что в перспективе нас ждет только хорошее и ясное погод. Ведь у Ксении получилось забросить монету. Видимо это как-то позабавило духом. 300 километров по сложным алтайским сикзагам дело непростое. Тем более, что Дима всего несколько месяцев за рулем и сразу такое автопутешествие. 5 месяцев за рулем будет достаточно интересно получается. 2 тысячи километров уже и как минимум испытания. Еще 2 тысячи километров будет. Если говорить, что все семьи, то это тоже самое дальнее путешествие. С трудом добрались еще до одного перевала Чикитаман. Края неосторожно заехали на вершину. Всю его уникальную красотищу посмотреть нам не удалось, потому что проезжали это место уже в сумерках и во время дождя. И все это на фоне обалденно красивой долины. Там даже диналья просто миляни. А ветер тем не менее начал подкрадываться. И чем гуще становились сумерки, умноженные на изрядную усу, то, что они не выживали, они не выживали. И вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, вот, Вот в этом месте, да, свой микроклимат между зимним киперевалом и дальнейшими горами, которые тоже высоко, а здесь довольно низко и в то же время нет ветров, что поэтому ночевать здесь стоит.","The silence that we met yesterday on the way continued today. The noise of the drops breaking down everything that is on the street, then it was quiet, then the threat was intensifying. Such uncertainty stopped the process of solving a serious issue. Did you crawl from under the blanket or not? Although breakfast is already over. Here, in such conditions, we are preparing a material for processing and We have a little thing called a matem. It helps us to be on the Internet almost everywhere. What kind of socks? Well, some kind of warm money. Okay. We just have to solve it. We lost our socks in the daughter's shoes. We found them. Dima, what is the base name? Usadba Yarcevsk. In the village of Katun. We got here. We realized that our stop here is a short-term phenomenon. It was hoped that we would have time to ride horses before lunch or to swim on a raft. But pieces of blue sky dissolved into gray. The water is very cold, but it's not very hot. I think it's different climate and weather. It's closer to Mongolia, I think. It's almost impossible to go there. It's just that there's no point staying in the houses. I think the same thing. Are we tourists? Let's go. And it was worth just sitting in the car like the rain has fallen again. What a nonsense! Is it possible that Alta and us don't want to accept? We must urgently come up with something so that the spirits become more noble to us. While our cars have come across the wet rain, We were discussing why we didn't stay at the base. We could spend a week there and not to go anywhere anymore, and not to torture our children with the transfer from place to place. And that's why I didn't get the reason. The Bajarcev's village is just one of the endless bases located on the length of many kilometers along the Katun. There is almost the same kitchen as everywhere, where you can express your wishes when ordering food. The menu seems to be wide, but quite standard. It is offered a fairly standard set of entertainment, excursions on the standard places and hitchhiking. One word is a popular place. Such a common tourist zone, where most people come. After all, many people think that it is quite enough to reach the villages of Manjaroq, Katun, Mayma, Ust-Sima or Chimal, to sit on one of such buses, and this is enough to visit the Voltaire. And here's how nice the thought began to warm the soul. After all, our families are able to change the warmth and comfort in the house, It's a great opportunity for families to show their manly qualities. And for moms to show their sincere care for their children. waiting for us in front of them. Such thoughts were subdued and made us feel confident. and to cancel this trip and travel. We are sorry about this, but health is above all. We decided to leave it at home, now we have to send the MMS, photos, to the post. In general, somehow maintain the connection, so that her feelings are like she is also with us on the journey. The Chuyi Tract is passed through one of the most important places, the Simin Pass, the edge of the northern and central Alps. The height is 1715 meters above sea level. It's very unpleasant here, the weather has met us. While Dmitry was reading information about the pass and was looking in which directions the famous world capital is located, his son Maxin found a huge granite stone, on which there were many coins. The elder patron offered to build a coin basketball. It's not just to put a coin, but to throw it from several meters so that it remains on the stone. At the same time, everyone was forming a thought-telling. and dry weather. Everyone made a attempt, but only Ksiusha managed to throw away and leave the coin on the stone. Of course, no one gave this ritual a special importance and everyone went to the souvenir shop. There, it's more interesting. In general, we, as our children, flew to any colorful self-made and decided to get a little bit of ourselves. We are going to take some pictures and then we will upload the video. Now it is very hot and we are covered with clouds. We didn't manage to leave the pass, suddenly the miracles began. The nature wanted to give us a gift and gave us a great and pure joy. And the war. The road is accelerated in the middle of the road. We were very happy that in the future we will have only good and clear weather. After all, Xenia managed to throw the coin. Apparently, it somehow saved the spirit. 300 kilometers along the complex Maltaic zigzag is not an easy thing. Moreover, Dima is only a few months behind the wheel and immediately such a car of travel. We will be driving for 5 months, it will be interesting. It is already 2000 km and it will be another 2000 km. If we say that all families are the same, then it is also the longest journey. With difficulty we got to one more Chikitaman pass. The edges were carefully covered with the top. We couldn't see its unique beauty because we passed this place in the sun and in the rain. The tea is ready. We'll try it. Red root, padan, raspberry, chibre, chibre, labozo, and currill tea. So many wonderful aromas came out of our thermos when our poisonous nest was brewed. And all this is in the background of an amazing beautiful valley. It's raining there, just a million. And the wind, nevertheless, began to hide. And the thicker the Sumerks became, multiplied by the We are tired and the roads are not so good, so we decided to find a place to sleep. It's better not to risk, to stop and spend the night on the nearest field."

I don't care if they're not the greatest shotgun in the world these things are a fucking blast just the pure funness of it the way they reload the way they do the little You know what I'm saying, and yeah, I got rideshield just for shits and giggles Now those of you who knew me knew my channel etc etc Every Friday is the start of shotgun weekend on this channel Every Friday we got shotgun fun Fridays. You guys get to vote on the game the gun Whatever you want. Sorry the game the shotgun. Let me correct myself that you guys want to see next Friday. Sunday to finish off the weekend we have stakeout Sundays the gun that is put me into this YouTube thing so yeah we got lots of fun stuff we got lots of good shotguns we got lots of good fun shit pretty much so sit back relax and enjoy simple as that domination one for two I'm not gonna say it's my favorite right now it's okay that's all I get that's all it gets from me is it's okay I do go Dees. I got the highest kills of my team. I think I have the most captures even not my team bounced with you But yeah, like I don't play super aggressive because no offense these guns are not After they did the whole nerfing on them years years ago when this game was actually popular They weren't really the best guns to use anymore. I remember when they first came out my god These things that Kimbo was retarded you might as well Honestly use them as a sniper rifle because I used to run these all the time. They're really not they're honestly kind of shitty now You're lucky to get a one-shot kill. I mean I'm getting pretty lucky a lot here, but Normally you're not gonna get too many of them from at least like any tiny bit of a range you're not going to It almost seems like a pellet gun to be honest with you, but It works it does this job, I guess I can't say it's an awesome shotgun I so many more shotguns in this this game especially that I would prefer over these Definitely now What else did I want to say there's something else I wanted to say to you? I just don't remember God I'm having a rough week with commentaries. Honestly Straight up. I'm just having brain fart moments every day. I think I'm getting dumber and dumber by the day I Seriously mean that I think it's from working in a factory for so many years. I'm I shouldn't have reloaded right here. I don't know why I did But yeah, I mean I'm getting dumber. I think by the day seriously it sounds pretty funny But I mean it though. I'm gonna ask a nurse if she wants to lend a helping hand. tonight again fuck sakes I hate work work sucks pretty much sucks big floppy donkey dick so but you know what I have to work gotta pay them bills not really much I can do but I really was hoping to play maybe something with you guys tomorrow but I can't tomorrow Saturday and Saturday night I'm going to my sister's stag and doe buck and doe whatever you call it some people call it a buck and doe some people call us stag and doe and watch this faggot seriously you really direct impacted me I'm going to my sister's Bucking Dough tomorrow. I'm not honestly excited. I normally would be for Bucking Dough, but I have to be sober and... What's the word here? There's a word I'm looking for. I have to be sober and... Civil, I guess is the word. It's not really what I'm looking for, but somewhat civil because I have to... I'm the money guy. I get to walk around. I you know, not even remotely close. So yeah, three drinks, that's it. Boo freaking shit. But hey, it's my sister's wedding coming up, it's her buck and doe, so you know what? It's what she wants really. That's about it. Look at this dude, look at it. Spray and pray that fucking bear you bastard. But I stick them anyways, I'm gonna kill him. I don't know why, but I do. But anyways, yeah. It's my sister's buck and doe, she's getting married in November. Actually, she gets married the same week that the new Call of Duty comes out which is actually kind of ironic.

Novik established the Institute of Molecular Biology at Eugene in Oregon in 1959. Shortly afterwards, he hired a bacteriophage researcher called George Streisinger. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, had been used used as a model system to establish many of the basic principles of molecular biology, such as the nature of mutation and of genes, and the importance of DNA. Streisinger had worked on phage with a number of big names in early molecular biology, including Salvador Luria, Max Del Brooke and Seymour Benzer. Streisinger was keen to develop a model system that could be used like phage to investigate vertebrate biology. He was a keen naturalist and tropical fish enthusiast. and so he knew that zebrafish were easy to keep as pets. However, establishing techniques for raising zebrafish on a mass scale and developing methods for analysing them was a long-term undertaking. Then, as now, science funding was based around a model of short-term research projects, and this kind of long-term infrastructure development was hard to get money for. Fortunately, Streisinger's boss Aaron Novick, perhaps inspired by his father's socialist beliefs, operated regime at Oregon where funds were redistributed between projects and where there wasn't too much pressure to produce papers. Colleagues who were turning out publications and getting grants thus subsidized Streisinger, who published nothing on Zebra Fish during the 1970s. Streisinger's lack of publications was partly due to the fact that he was busy as a political activist, protesting against nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War and damage to the environment. However, Streisinger's lack of papers was also also due to the lengthy process of developing techniques that would allow the kinds of mutation experiment he had carried out on bacteria phages to be carried out in zebrafish with their vastly more complex genome. He developed methods for carrying out mutagenesis and genetic mapping in fish. He also grappled with the problem that, like most vertebrates, zebrafish are diploid organisms with two copies of each chromosome and thus of each gene. This makes it hard to carry out genetic investigations. Stryzinger developed methods for creating haploid embryos with one copy of each chromosome and for creating double haploid fish that are homozygous at all locations. Using these double haploid techniques he went on to create clone lines of genetically identical fish and this finally got him a publication making the front cover of nature in 1981. Tragically just as zebrafish research was taking off in the early 1980s George Stryzinger died of a heart attack while taking a scuba diving exam. But this was not the end for zebrafish research in Oregon. Streisinger's colleagues continued his work. Chuck Kimmel carried out work on tracing the fate map of cells and tissues in the developing zebrafish embryo. Monty Westerfield wrote a primer on methods for rearing and studying zebrafish, and today he heads up ZEDFIN, the database of all things zebrafish. This zebrafish work in the 1980s helped reveal the remarkably high degree of evolutionary of vertebrate development at the molecular level. The fact that many aspects of development remain the same between fish and humans makes the zebrafish a useful model for disease research. In the 1990s a new centre of zebrafish research developed in Tübingen in Germany. When renowned fruit fly geneticist Christiana Musslein-Volhard decided to turn her hand to fish, she had previously carried out large-scale mutation of Drosophila fruit flies discovered genes involved in development, and she now applied this approach to zebrafish. Between 1993 and 1995, a big screen for zebrafish mutants was carried out by her Chewbigan lab, and by a lab in Boston headed by her student, Wolfgang Driewer. This produced 4,000 different types of zebrafish with lethal mutations that prevented their normal development. This collection of mutants provided ample avenues for further research into the genetics of development. And as a result, the number of research groups working with zebrafish increased enormously. Today, the zebrafish has had its genome sequence to a high standard, and an increasing array of tools are available for carrying out targeted genome modifications. Thus, the fish that George Streisinger turned into a research tool is more important than ever to science. This talk is largely based on Jim Endersby's excellent book, A Guinea Pig's History of Biology, which describes the development of modern biology by means of telling the stories of a number of model organisms. This was supplemented by Grunwald and Eisen's account of zebrafish history in Nature Reviews genetics.","The zebrafish is a staple inhabitant of freshwater aquariums the size of a goldfish It's also the subject of research by thousands of scientists worldwide It's embryos are large and transparent making it handy for studying vertebrate development But how did this particular fish come to be so widely studied to understand this we have to go back to the Manhattan Project?

Hoje os eventos do Asoghi Cultural também entram em gente de fora do plano piloto e até mesmo turistas de passagem para pela capital federal.

Este sucesso nasceu do inconformismo e falta de oportunidade de um açougueiro, que hoje é um dos responsáveis pela mudança nas relações artísticas culturais no Distrito Federal.

Eu gosto porque se eu faço faculdade e muitas vezes eu venho aqui para pegar alguns livros para me auxiliar.

Today, the events of the cultural Asoghi also come in people from outside the pilot's plane and even tourists from I think it's an excellent initiative for the guys there at the Asoghe. I'm from the city, I'm from Rio de Janeiro, I'm at my daughter's house here in Passage. I'm delighted with the event. I think it's wonderful, I even think we needed to have more incentive about it. It would be wonderful. I think it's a great idea to close the street so we can enjoy this cultural night. Every semester, the Asoghe organizes a big event, a main show, of the cultural night, I'm the mini-presenter of the event. What is the importance of a cultural assogue like this for the city artists of the country today? In addition to offering a very high-quality meat, we are developing an immense work here, which is small cells, small works made with various local artists, that is, the assogue has become one of the main references of the cultural making of the city. The cultural and cultural Asog is definitely on the national calendar. It's a bit strange, it's a culture Asog. But it's absolutely interesting. This success was born out of the lack of a chance of being a soloist, which is one of the most responsible for the change in cultural relations in the Federal District. I saw a humble family, who didn't know this art. After I started reading it, I woke up interested in it. And how did you decide to put this into a show? People were surprised at the beginning, at the initiative, even today, people who don't know the project, and it's strange because it's not a common environment. But, thank God, it was right, people have accepted it. Four years ago, Asog maintained a project, Amigo das Bibliotecas, which provides books on the bus stop of the pilot's plan, and also shows the project's future. It's free. There are 70 microbiotec and it's a project of a very large axis, copied in many cities of Brazil. I like it because I do college and many times I come here to get some books to help me. I know Asougo by the press, by the comments of the shows he does and yesterday I saw the show of Zé Ramalho that interests me today, so I came here to buy meat and see if this part is good."

I hope you come out on January 3rd. But there's no reason to be despondent about how this country is going right now if we do the right thing. And I believe that most people in this country know what the right thing is to do. The country has a little within our means. And therefore I propose in the first year to cut federal government spending by $1 trillion. showing he's popular there, but the Texas Congressman responding to harsh words from his rivals Mitt Romney, Michelle Bachman, among others, saying Paul will not be the nominee. Newt Gingrich says he wouldn't even vote for him. Doug Weed is a senior advisor to Ron Paul. He's been with him in Iowa, but happens to be in DC today. Doug, thanks for being with us. Congressman Paul is being criticized by his rivals and others for, among other things, claiming that America is to blame for nine condemning the killings of Bin Laden and Anwar Abulaki and blaming the US for provoking Iran's nuclear program. Aren't those foreign policy views of Mr. Paul contrary to what most Americans think? I think they would be if those were truly his sentiments, but a lot of what he says and believes is misrepresented. He believes strongly in the Constitution and that if we want to go to war, let's go to war. He voted in favor of of going after Osama bin Laden. And he supported Israel in 1981. He opposed the assassination now. He opposed the way the assassination was conducted. He felt it should have been done immediately when we went in. Did he say that America should blame for 9-11 because we had troops in Saudi Arabia? No, he hasn't said that. He said that that is the reason that that is what many Islamic fundamentalists believe. He believes that they believe. Yes, that's true. And many observers, including our own Defense Department, Wolfowitz and others say that. They may not. Ron Paul is incorruptible. He's honest. He's a good example of our foreign policy now. Just in the last few weeks, we have troops on the ground, boots on the ground in Australia for purposes of defending us against China. So we borrow money from China to have American troops in Australia to defend us against China. He believes we need a little bit of little more sanity to our foreign policy. dangerous as president. That's Michelle Bachman. Your response to that Doug? There's nothing dangerous about the US Constitution. If blocking the Straits of Hormuz or some other action by Iran was deemed as an act of war or we decided we needed to react as a president he would take it to the US Constitution to the US Congress we would decide declare war we'd win it and then we'd get out. That's what he believes. And the US Constitution is not dangerous. It's dangerous to take these risks of avoiding. I'm trying to run through a bunch of subjects here. I want to put these economic ideas up on the screen. We heard one of them in the introduction, cutting one trillion of spending in the first year alone. Terminate five-capital agencies lower corporate tax rate to 15% eliminate capital gains taxes. Narrow the new health care law. Repeal Sarbanes-Oxley, the corporate financial reporting. But look, Doug Rick-Santorn, took a look at that and he said, you know what? Ron Paul couldn't get Congress to cut or eliminate anything since he's only passed one bill in 20 years in Congress. I double checked that with a library of Congress. Ron Paul sponsored 620 bills. He passed one and it was fairly insignificant. Doesn't Congressman Paul have a history of failure when it comes to getting his proposals passed? You know, the greatest contribution he's made, he doesn't get a lot of credit for, because he doesn't put his name on everything, was pulling back the curtain on the Federal Reserve. Four years ago, Greg, 74% of this country didn't even know what the Federal Reserve is. Today, 78% of the nation wants it audited. Obama, Romney would audit a waitress to make sure she pays taxes on her tip money, but won't audit the Federal Reserve. But thanks to Ron Paul, we got a partial audit. It showed in 2008 that $16 trillion dollars. The national debt was $14 trillion. $16 trillion was loaned out in interest-free money to major banks in this country. We've always had corruption in Washington, but people are really angry because the corruption has reached a level that they're losing the value of their homes, the value of their IRAs. And Ron Paul is the only person with the guts to take this on. Let me squeeze one more in about the polls. And we don't sneeze at the fact that he has a strong organization in Iowa, which we said in the introduction, he's very popular, the polls demonstrate that. He's at or near the top, but there's a different poll I wanna ask you about. It's a recent Washington Post poll of the 25% of voters who view him favorably, nearly two thirds do not identify themselves as Republicans. And among conservatives, only 8% view him favorably. Doug, how do you win the GOP nomination with numbers like that? Well, I'll give you some more numbers from that very same poll and from the recent poll last night that was released by NBC. They show the perception is that Ron Paul can't win a general election. They show in the NBC poll 8% of registered Republicans don't think he can win. The ABC poll which shows that 9% think he can't win. But the same poll asked them to choose between Barack Obama and Ron Paul. And Ron Paul did better than Newt Gingrich and was with a statistical tie of Mitt Romney. So we have a candidate who can win. And the best evidence of that, Greg, is you don't see any Democrat pundits on TV puffing Ron Paul because they know he can win. All right. And as we mentioned, he can win in Iowa. It's very strong there. And he's pretty strong in some other states as well. You're a very eloquent spokesperson. So Doug Lee, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it.","I ask you for your support.

Congressman Paul is being criticized by his rivals and others for, among other things, claiming that America is to blame for nine condemning the killings of Bin Laden and Anwar Abulaki and blaming the US for provoking Iran's nuclear program. Aren't those foreign policy views of Mr. Paul contrary to what most Americans think? I think they would be if those were truly his sentiments, but a lot of what he says and believes is misrepresented. He believes strongly in the Constitution and that if we want to go to war, let's go to war. He voted in favor of of going after Osama bin Laden. And he supported Israel in 1981 almost. He opposed the assassination now. He opposed the way the assassination was conducted. He felt it should have been done immediately when we went in. Did he say that America should blame for 9-11 because we had troops in Saudi Arabia? No, he hasn't said that. He said that that is the reason that that is what many Islamic fundamentalists believe. He believes that they believe. that. Yes, that's true. And many observers, including our own Defense Department, Wolfowitz and others say that. They may not. Ron Paul is incorruptible. He's honest. He's a good example of our foreign policy now. Just in the last few weeks, we have troops on the ground, boots on the ground in Australia for purposes of defending us against China. So we borrow money from China to have American troops in Australia to defend us against China. He believes we need a little little more sanity to our foreign policy. dangerous as president. That's Michelle Bachman. Your response to that Doug? There's nothing dangerous about the US Constitution. If blocking the straits of Hormuz or some other action by Iran was deemed as an act of war or we decided we needed to react as a president he would take it to the US Constitution to the US Congress we would decide declare war we'd win it and then we'd get out. That's what he believes. And the US Constitution is not dangerous. It's dangerous to take these risks of avoiding. I'm trying to run through a bunch of subjects here. I want to put these economic ideas up on the screen. We heard one of them in the introduction, cutting one trillion of spending in the first year alone. Terminate five cabinet agencies lower corporate tax rate to 15% eliminate capital gains taxes. Narrow the new health care law repeal Sarbanes-Oxley the corporate financial reporting. But look, Doug Rick Santorna, took a look at that and he said, you know what? Ron Paul couldn't get Congress to cut or eliminate anything since he's only passed one bill in 20 years in Congress. I double checked that with the Library of Congress. Ron Paul sponsored 620 bills. He passed one and it was fairly insignificant. Doesn't Congressman Paul have a history of failure when it comes to getting his proposals passed? You know, the greatest contribution he's made, he doesn't get a lot of credit for it. because he doesn't put his name on everything, was pulling back the curtain on the Federal Reserve. Four years ago, Greg, 74% of this country didn't even know what the Federal Reserve is. Today, 78% of the nation wants it audited. Obama, Romney would audit a waitress to make sure she pays taxes on her tip money, but won't audit the Federal Reserve. But thanks to Ron Paul, we got a partial audit. It showed in 2008 that $16 trillion The national debt was $14 trillion. $16 trillion was loaned out in interest-free money to major banks in this country. We've always had corruption in Washington, but people are really angry because the corruption has reached a level that they're losing the value of their homes, the value of their IRAs. And Ron Paul is the only person with the guts to take this on. Let me squeeze one more in about the polls. And we don't sneeze at the fact that he has a lot of money. has a strong organization in Iowa, which we said in the introduction, he's very popular. The polls demonstrate that. He's at or near the top. But there's a different poll I want to ask you about. It's a recent Washington Post poll of the 25% of voters who view him favorably, nearly 2 thirds do not identify themselves as Republicans. And among conservatives, only 8% view him favorably. Doug, how do you win the GOP nomination with numbers like that? Well, I'll give you some more numbers from that very same poll and from the recent poll last night that was released by NBC. They show the perception is that Ron Paul can't win a general election. They show in the NBC poll, 8% of registered Republicans don't think he can win. The ABC poll, which shows that 9% think he can't win. But the same poll asked them to choose between Barack Obama and Ron Paul. And Ron Paul did better than Newt Gingrich. and was with a statistical tie of Mitt Romney. So we have a candidate who can win. And the best evidence of that, Greg, is you don't see any Democrat pundits on TV puffing Ron Paul because they know he can win. All right. And as we mentioned, he can win in Iowa. It's very strong there. And he's pretty strong in some other states as well. You're a very eloquent spokesperson. So Doug Lee, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it."

Fomos a longo da partida, entramos muito fortes. Depois de alguma fase ali que o padroense tentou criar almas recoladas na parte final da primeira parte. Depois, em segunda parte, entramos novamente muito fortes. Chegámos ao 2-0. Pense que poderemos ter feito mais gols do que a que fizemos. e depois num lance que nem é a oportunidade de golguer, um lance em remate de lões, o adversário reduziu e depois aí tivemos que nos adaptar e jogar o com o fenômetro e com o decorrer do jogo para assegurarmos os três pontos. Agora tenho que dar os parabéns à equipe, pelo futebol que apresentou, porque acho que fomos claramente superiores ao adversário, resultado paca por escasso, mas Eu já alertei os meus jogadores que neste campeonato não vai haver resultados muito desnivelados. Será tudo discutido palma-palma. Então quando isso acontece nós temos que cerrar a equipe com unhas identes e tentar assegurar os traspontos que é o mais importante. Feijão muito complicado, entramos no campo com cabeça e ficamos pensando em ganhar. Por anotas dificuldades conseguimos ultrapassar o adversário e nos trazer os treinos para o mais importante. Punto a ponto vamos somar e vamos conseguindo os nossos objetivos com o mais importante. O grupo está confiante que tudo vai correr bem e vamos mostrar nossa qualidade.","The result is fair for the K-Kamoku team to present themselves inside the field. We entered very strong during the match. Then there was a phase where the squad tried to create some recollections in the final part of the first half. Then we entered very strong again, we reached 2-0. I think we could have done more goals than the K-Kamoku we did. and then we didn't even have the chance to go all the way, we just started a long shot, the opponent reduced it and then we had to adapt and play with the speedometer and the game's running to secure the three points. Now I have to say congratulations to the team for the football they presented because I think we were clearly superior to the opponent, the result is poor, but I've already warned my players that in this championship there will be no results, everything will be discussed, everything will be solved. So when that happens we have to close the team with the same lines and try to secure the three points which is the most important. It was very complicated, we entered the field with our heads and we were hoping to win. For all the difficulties we managed to cross the opponent's side We are going to be more important. We are going to achieve our goals. The group is confident that everything will go well and we are going to show our quality."

It's not the reason I don't want to get up anymore Because for me you were everything And suddenly you left With a goodbye you and I didn't want to know about myself Ending up like this with my desire I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid of tomorrow, because I don't have you here, playing under my wings.

It may not be useful to you because it is already destroyed, but keep it always, that I will always be by your side. My great enemy, the distance made a lot, I will always remember that kiss in that park. You swore this eternal love, I fell in love very soon, you broke that promise and then you left with another. I remember your looks, those eyes of my dream, that pineapple angel that was before this little one. Your radio is so visible, as she told me, And my heart is suffering, it can't stand it anymore, more hurt. I'm a poet like that, but without inspiration. If I have to die, I hope it's for love. Be the person I wanted, my last breath. Because I still want to think about what I've suffered. Poet like that, but without inspiration. If I have to die, I hope it's for love. Be the person I wanted, my last breath. Because I still want to think about what I've suffered. My path is easy, my life was fiction. I don't go on anymore, for dreams, for dreams, dreams are. Now the drama is over. I don't know if I'll see you, I'm sure I'm going to hell Look up, I see how the blue sky calls me I don't know if it's worth it to be here without you Yesterday I did what possible But you did it by hand, I don't know how to fight If I die late or early You asked me for my hand, I gave you my whole arm in the past I was very stupid, I didn't say much, I love you But I step to scratch myself Things go by something, I still keep on crying I want to have you by my side I know I don't care that you're happy without me Maybe I'll forget when I get tired of suffering These poems that I invent are the strength that remains I want to die and start a new life The sun I no longer see my life has become dark"

And then JV Amonus had a two run home run that tied the game up. Nathan Costa had a big RBI single that put us ahead. Somerset came back to tie it up. And then Corey Burns had it had the big hit in the eighth inning. that put us ahead and Cody Rocha pitched had a great game hitting and pitching and he had a great playing center field also so Cody Rocha was a big factor yesterday. Just a great team win to be down like that and then come back against a good team like Somerset so that was a quality win for us and it puts us at nine and two. We need one more win to qualify for the tournament. We're one and all in the big three. We beat Brockton last Friday, 13 to one, which was a great way for us to get to the top. to start out the big three. We have a big game Thursday night against New Bedford under the lights over there at 6.30. We bet that's having a very good year. That's going to be a very good test for us. And if we win, then we clinch a tournament berth. And we go 2-0 in the big three. So that's what we're looking to do."

Should it have been more than one? The only doubt I had was whether it was inside or just outside. But from where I saw it, it looked like a stone wall penalty, he just took Sam clean out. So a bit disappointed with that decision but got a point away from him at Morkham on a Friday night. So a well-earned point and a good defensive display, I thought. And different from recent away games where on the sides you've got through a bit too easily. Yeah, that's right. We had a game plan tonight where we had Russell Mollon just sitting in from and mopping things off and breaking the play-off and I thought they did that super. It was difficult for both teams to get anything going, really. One, the pit-trunk, conducive to a passing game and the conditions weren't. So it was always going to be a bit of a scrap and we stood up to the test and got the point. Not many chances, but some of you might have had one at the back stick from a cross from Germain in the second half. I'd had Mo not got a touch at the near post. In fact, some of you was busy all night, I thought. I thought Sam was superb to be honest. He's been out the team, in and out the team. He's got his chance tonight and I thought he was lively. He showed some good positional sense and he played some nice balls through. Like I say, he was getting forward as well, so he gave us another option. If Mo might have missed it or Jermaine would have put him in back stick, he might have got his goal, what his performance deserved. But I want to be in, like I say, it was a good point for us. How do you fix it? picking points on the way where we've not in recent weeks then I think we'll be up and around there. Steve, not that long ago since you played Rochdale away and if you defend like you did tonight you think you've got a far more chance to get a decent result? Yeah of course, yeah it was one of our off nights at Rochdale away you know. So yeah we look forward to the game another Friday night game under the lights they've got travel down so yeah pretty confident at home so yeah looking forward to the game. Everyone was a bit surprised not anything against Keith Everyone's a bit surprised when the manager checked him in last Saturday but he's put into a good performance as long as he was. Do you also like, compared to Beto, anything different with Keith? Not particularly, no. You've got to get on with it. The manager makes his decisions, you're his players, you get on with it, accept the decisions and it might be me, you know, it could be any of us. So we've got to be on top form but Keith's coming like I said and he's done well and we've had two good results. So, you know, that's Keith, it's up to Keith then if he's given a chance then he's taking it obviously. It could be any of us, you know. So we're all on our toes and we're all on our metal. We've got to be on our game. Yeah, but those games where you've shipped a few away, you can't really pin it on just the back four, can you? Because there were times when you were getting over on at Rockstall and this whole team that has to defend this holiday, isn't it? Not just the back four. Yeah, of course. It all starts from the forwards at the end of the day. The harder they work, the easier they make it for the midfielder. Midfielders and the same with us. The harder the midfield work makes our job easier. So it goes right through the team and any defeat is not a problem. It's not down to any sort of individual unit. It's the whole team. It'll always start from somewhere, a mistake from somewhere, or someone being out of position. So, you know, yeah, it's a team thing. We win together, lose together, draw together, and hopefully, at the end of the season, go up together. Yeah, Ellison is not quite in the Jagdinfeltenberg category. Always do when he gets to the top, but he does cause problems, and he starts on the left, gets into the box, good in the air. Yeah, he's a nuisance. You can tell he's been around and he's played the game. He's a nuisance, he gets in your face, It rattles people, it riles people up, it gets under your skin but as you get a bit older you laugh it off and you get on with it. Some of the young lad's will have experienced it now. It's been a few games. Yeah, he's a good old pro and he knows how to play the game and you come across him now and again. Is the clean sheet the most pleasing thing today, especially after the recent away? Yeah, definitely. You come away from home, especially to place that mark on. Notoriously difficult. You base any performance on you want a clean sheet and anything else is pretty much a bonus and I thought we had chances to win the game I didn't quite take them, but like I said kept the clean sheet so we've got a point I know it's not easy to put your finger up if there's one or two things maybe that you just need to click into top four may got 19 games left Everyone could see it's a good set of players here, but just getting back that sort of what you know you're capable of Yeah, yeah, we need to we need to score more goals at the end of the day, you know I mean there's been a few changes up front, a few partnerships. This is quite clipped, I think maybe Wickham at home probably was the best pairing but obviously the gap has not chosen to play that since but that's his decision and I think all over the pitch we need to start scoring more goals I mean we need to turn these nil nils into one nils, scrappy one nils and the best teams do and we've got to try and do that now. there, but does everyone just want to get in, nail down a place so you can have what everyone's doing for the next eight, nineteen games? That's the aim, you want to be in the team, you want to nail your place down and the Gaffer said before the game no one's really nailing the place down at the moment so like I say it's dropping and changing and you see who wants it and who's up for it. All the lads are, all the lads are you know and people do dip in form and people are in good form and people are in bad form but at the end of the day we've got 17-18 players who rule Vine for a spot in the starting 11. When they get the chance they want to take it. It's an honest bunch of lads and it's one of the best lads I've worked with. It's a great squad and we just need to score a few more goals and we'll be alright. Weekend in front of the five? Yeah, and the D's tell me about three days to do floss. Hopefully I'll be alright by Monday."

Bienvenidos nuevamente al maravilloso mundo de Lexa, el torneo de Fútbol 6 de los 6 alumnos del colegio Las Alles Floridas. Se completó la segunda mitad de la cuarta fecha y lentamente el torneo Clausura va siguiendo su curso. Tras presentarnos abrimos el telón de un nuevo capítulo de la DSTV. de Alexa en el 2000, mientras que Botanic se fundó en el clausura 2007 que lo coronó campeón con varios sexnapoli. Entre ellos, el arquero Matías Gil, Luciano Batistón, Santiago de Luca, Gabriel Rodríguez y Juan Paulo Solari, sin olvidarnos de Ignacio Senador, actualmente suspendido. Para este torneo la palabra disolución sonó fuerte en el plantel Tano, pero con el regreso de Javier VI tras su paso por Maeliola y la presencia fija de su goleador Santiago Martínez y de Santiago Perrón en el arco, se decidió por continuar. ¡Vamos! ¡Vamos! con esa linda resolución establecía el empate transitorio. 1-1 y festejo un tanto particular. Y a los 15, Batistón la vuelve a jugar para Gabino. Este pibotea muy bien y Santi de Luca no falla. En dos minutos lo daba vuelta Botani, 2-1. Agrandado por el gol, de Luca metías el indotunnel, y en la última jugada de la primera parte, García Nallar tardaba más de la cuenta, no le pegaba el arco y Napoli se perdía la igualdad antes de que llegue el descanso. Arranque del segundo tiempo no muy vistoso, todo lo contrario. grabado, fricionado y con alguna pierna fuerte de más, como la que aquí sufre el Gallegos esto. Baty pizpeda de reojo la determinación del juez, le mete un poquito de actuación, pero no safa de la tarjeta amarilla. De ese tiro libre va a venir al disparo de Lucas Tarigo, la no-contención del arquero, una serie de rebotes, el amague de Santi Martínez y el posterior puntinazo que se pierde por la linea de fondo. Sigue buscando el Núñez Napolitano, intenta la gambeta que no prospera, es lateral, pero lo hacen el corner y de adentro de la cancha. para el otro lado entonces y Gamusa que empieza a no compartir los fallos del árbitro. Nueva pelota parada para Napoli, sexto en la ejecución, cerca. Botanin no podía tener la pelota en un partido que comenzaba a levantar temperatura. Tarigo tiraba esa patadita y como ya tenía amarilla veía la tarjeta azul. Enseguida vemos la pisada de un peligroso gabino y la doble atajada del perro, merecedora de todos estos aplausos. Segundo capítulo del partido aparte que jugaba Martínez contra el hombre de enero. Da la impresión que que la pelota no salen su totalidad y tras la fusilla a protesta el delantero era amonestado. de pero el resultado no se modificó. Botanix supo golpear en los momentos precisos y se quedó con un triunfo importante que le permite mantener el invicto en el torneo. Por el lado tano, el balance es sumamente negativo. Perdió el clásico y por varias fechas no podrá contar con su goleador Santi Martínez. uno de los participantes del equipo y bueno, dejo con uno menos y bueno, ya está, acá con uno menos es imposible, jugando en cancha grande puede ser acá, no se puede hacer nada. Primeras posiciones de la D, Gorranesa y Botanik son líderes con 10 puntos, uno menos tiene rústico, Guarto está al invicto hijo de la obra con 8, un escalón más abajo viene la banda y luego con 6 aparecen colchoneros, la naranja y Cebaipa.","Auspicean, La 10 TV Welcome back to the wonderful world of Lexa, the football 6 tournament of the sixth students of the College of the Salle Florida. The second half of the fourth date was completed and slowly the Clousura tournament continues its course. After presenting, we open the teal of a new chapter of the 10 TV. We started with the classic between Napoli and Botanic. Most are teammates from the primary school, so they have known each other for 20 years. The Celestes started in the of the XA in 2000, while Botanic was founded in the 2007 clause that crowned him champion with several sexnapoli. Among them, the goalkeeper Matías Gil, Luciano Batistón, Santiago de Luca, Gabriel Rodríguez and Juan Paulo Solari, without forgetting Ignacio Senador, currently suspended. For this tournament, the word dissolution is not strong in the Tano squad, but with the return of Javier Sesto after his step by Maíliola and the fixed presence of his fan Santiago Martinez and Santiago Perrón in the arc, he decided to continue. in the game. Napoli better in the beginning. Martin Zucotti is the one who puts it in the area and Santi Martinez the one who can't define against the girl of the moon. However, in the next deluge he tries the canyon that doesn't happen. The ballads are badly stopped in defense and after the habilitation of this, Gamusa has a rematch and puts the 1-0 for Napoli at 8 minutes. The red and white did not go through it at all. Mati Gil asked for tranquility and his teammates were going to give it to him because at 13, in the first of the danger that Botanic had in the match, Batistón was rematch and Agustín Aguilio With that nice resolution, he established the transit tie. 1-1 and a particular party. And at 15, Batistone goes back to play for Gabino. This one was very good and Santi de Luca didn't fail. In 2 minutes, he gave it back to Botanic. 2-1. Granted by Luca's goal, he scored a nice tunnel. And in the last game of the first half, García Nallar was slow on the count, he didn't hit the goal and Napoli lost the equalizer before the break. The second half started not very visible. Quite the opposite. with a strong leg like the one that suffers the sixth ball. Baty pips the judge's determination, puts him in a little bit of play, but not the yellow card. From that free shot, Lucas Tarigó's shot comes, the non-contention of the goalkeeper, a series of rebots, the Maguette of Santi Martinez, and the rear point that is lost by the bottom line. He continues to look for the nine-point, tries the gambeta that does not prosper, is lateral, but makes him the corner and from within the field, takes it from the side, and Gamusa, who begins not to share the failures of the referee. New ball for Napoli, sixth in the run, close. Botany could not have the ball in a game that began to raise temperature. Tarigo threw that leg and as it was already yellow, he saw the blue card. Immediately we see the step of a dangerous Gavino and the double box of the dog, a merit of all these applause. Second chapter of the game, which played Martínez against the man of the black. It gives the impression that the player is not The ball didn't go out in its entirety and after the run-up the striker was upset. Batistón vs. 2 makes a delirious and Santi de Luca, rare in him, a derrusting. However, the goalkeeper makes a mistake and goes out against him. Gavino in the lead. With all the space and time in his favor, he opens it well and de Luca rebounds with this goal. He stretched out in a botanical difference, 3-1. Nervous, Napoli went for the score and Gamusa, not very calm, patiated unnecessarily the ball and Doguil had already dominated it. In conclusion, in 10 seconds he received the blue card for double compensation, the red for that series of dedications against the judge and the challenge of his partner. Complete. The game continued and behind the side, Napoli intended to make the change for the blue of Martinez, but the referee correctly did not allow it because the expulsion of the player was sanctioned within the game field. With a less player and involved in attack, Napoli was unprotected back and Gavino was close to scoring the fourth, and in the last, Napoli searched for but the result did not change Botanic knew how to hit in the precise moments and stayed with an important triumph that allows him to maintain the invite to the tournament. On the other hand, the balance is extremely negative, he lost the classic and for several dates he will not be able to count with his goalkeeper Santi Martinez. One of the team's participants, and well, he leaves with one less and well, it's done. With one less it's impossible. The big field can be here, you can't do anything. First positions of the D. Corranes and Botanic are leaders with 10 points. One less has Rustico. Guarto is the son of the work with 8. A lower step comes the team and then with 6, Colchoneros appears, the orange and Cebaipa."

You will be making your own election. I stand here. I do not represent a party. I do not represent this party here. I do not represent that party. I am partial. But I do stand here and I want to read something from the Bible. And I want to speak to you people. And I want to implore you that this day you will make a vote with your conscience. You won't just vote for someone because you because you like the color of their banner or because they seem to be okay. We need to vote with our conscience what is right for there is two things. There is a right way and there's a wrong way. And if we vote for the wrong party or the wrong person, know this, you'll have to also live under that rule. So I want to read from the word of God, which says under two chronicles, Verse 7, chapter 7 verse 14, it says, Please people, it is very important if you repent if you believe if you pray to God and you seek him He will come down and forgive us of our sins, but only if we repent He says he will also come down and you will heal our land He'll heal our land from all corruption. He'll heal our land from sickness. He'll heal our land from from AIDS from theft He'll heal our land from violence from rape He'll heal our land but then we need to come before him and we need to seek him and I'm standing here I might look foolish but I'll rather be foolish for God than be foolish for man because I'm standing here and I'm beseeching you that you make the right decisions in your lives. It's not easy for me to stand here but because I love people I will rather stand here and give up my vote if they won't allow me in there but I'm sure that they will allow me but I want to speak to you you first. People, you need to vote with your conscience. I want to say one other thing. Most people think that they're good, like this man. He might think that he's good. But one day each and every one of us, like we stand here and we're voting for a party, one day we're all going to stand before Almighty God in kula kula, the one who created the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in it. And one day we're going to have to make, we're going to have to to account which God is going to ask us and he's even going to look at this day and this day will be in his record this day will also be in his in history and he's going to say how did you vote how did you vote did you vote with your conscience or did you vote according to man's idle promises for man promises so much but yet he falls so short of what his promises are the only person that you can rely on is God because when God says he will do something he will do it. And the reason why we are also being judged this day because of all the things that are happening around us is because we have turned away from Almighty God. Now I want to ask you would you all consider yourself good people? If you should die today and you have to stand before Almighty God do you think he will find you good enough and in righteousness that you will be able to enter into his presence or Will your sin condemn you and send you to hell? It is something that you have to think about. But it says in the Bible that it's a point of for man wants to die and then the judgment. So each one of us will die and will be judged by Almighty God. We will stand before him one day. How do you know whether you're living according to God's standards? It's easy. You need to look into the mirror of the 10 commandments. God's holy standard by which he expects each one of us to live by. There's a law of this land, but that law is flawed. There's a law that God gives us which is perfect, righteous and holy. It is the only standard by which man is to live by. If I should ask you how many lies have you told in your life? If you've told by one lie, God sees you as a liar. In kulu kulu, the mighty one sees every lie as a person who takes a lie as a liar. Some people might say but I lie to get out of trouble and I lie, I tell a little lie not to harm anyone but let me tell you a small lie if I come a lie to you I am hurting you by not telling you the truth. So today I'll stand you and I'll tell you the truth and I'll ask you to listen to your conscience. If you've told but one lie you are a liar in the sight of Almighty God. Let us go to the second commandment which I want to to look at which is commandment number eight.","Today is the day of voting for South Africa. You will be making your own election. I stand here.

I was struck by the fact that it is such a two dimensional representation or bas relief, so ironically aspects I considered minor are perhaps more significant.

We see here the face and even here on the side and then here as you can see in this enhanced photograph the back of the head. Now let's see why that could not possibly have been a shroud. Taking this doll as the model and taking this reconstruction here of the shroud, as you've seen, I've drawn the face of the doll, proportionate to the doll's size, including the hair on the side and the shoulders and the back of the head here, which meant, first of all, that the shroud was covering the body this way, which is rather unusual. for a shroud, I would say, but that's a minor point. If we look at it once it covers, we see that the chin on the drawing of the shroud is at the level of the nose on the doll. That's because there's no space here for the top of the head. Aside from the peculiarity that in the shroud there was hair on the side which is impossible as the hair would have been down on the lower shroud with no pressure. What we would expect had the shroud being real is something more like this. Here would have been the head. We would then have the entire head then here depicted in the shroud. No hair on the side. And we certainly would not expect fine lines. I imagine the shroud would probably have to have folded or the body being moved. So we would expect other markings here on the side. I think that suffices to prove that an infinite and all-powerful God is probably not interested in doing cheap parlor tricks that are also obvious once you know how to look.","This is just a very short proof that the Turin shroud is a fake and in any case not even a shroud.

If, of course, atmospheric conditions allow it. I think that the fact that we are willing to take part in this and never talk about such a flight is a proof that we are very willing to help in such situations. Regardless of what day or night it is, we are very willing to use such a situation to help, as I will say later, help often very young people, children and sometimes older people. You can be satisfied that someone is helping. You can save your life for someone. I think it's a nice idea. The crew arrived at the young patient, who was waiting for half a year. The action was carried out successfully, among others, thanks to the pilots. We almost always use military help. I can't imagine a Polish transplant without the help of military and air force.

But anyway this pack is 64x, it's called Sortex Van there. Link's in the description below where you can download it. It's got a customiser as well and it's also got like various like mods that it has technically I think I said that right Stumbling up on my words today. So yeah, this is Tech Shpack Spotlight, SawTechsFan for a link in the description So that's it for the Tech Shpack Spotlight this week. Join me again next week for a new Tech Shpack. But coming up next we have the Skin Spotlight. And welcome to this week's Skin Spotlight. This week's skin is Bowser! If you're a fan of Mario you definitely know who Bowser is anyway. So this is pretty awesome Bowser skin and the link in the description below where you can get it. water temple. I don't see much water other than these four pillars. Apparently it is a water temple. Oh, go through here. What the hell is this? Some kind of face. Lots of mobs in there. I don't know. Maybe I should have put it on easy. I mean, it's not easy, peaceful before I come in. So yeah, let's have a look around outside. There's some water. It is quite nicely done although I just do not like the texture of the Lapis block. I just can't stand that. So lots of people rate this quite highly on Planet Minecraft. So I thought I'd take a look. So yeah this is basically the Water Temple. It's got nice floating islands. I like those. And the links in the description below where you can download it. So that's it for the creation spot like this week. Coming up next we've got the Minecraft news, stay tuned for that. Now it's time for the Minecraft news, yeah, so what's new this week? Well there's a new snapshot as usual, it's 12w26a and there's not really that much different in the snapshot again, there's, they haven't really added anything in recent weeks at all. And this one is a lot of bug fixes and a massive performance bug has been fixed, so hopefully Minecraft will run a bit smoother but don't count on it. because it's badly optimized as it is. So there's still no news about where Minecon is as far as I can see, but Mojang have started getting settled into their new office as well so I guess that's a better news. But there's not really much to report to be honest, so that's it for the Minecraft news this week. Join me again next week for some more Minecraft news and coming up next we have the sea spotlight so stay tuned for that. Welcome to this week's seed spot, this week's seed is Good Seed Now! Yes, now's in caps, but the Good Seed is in small letters. And what this seed gets you is this, another survival island type area. It's got loads of sugarcane and it has a tree so you can get started. So that's always good and it's got some iron there. So once you start building your tools you can get some iron pretty quickly, get some nice action going. So yeah, this is actually sent in by two just Miranda again. So thanks for that. And that is it for the C Spotlight and the show this week. So yeah, not really much happened this week on the show, but what can you do really? So I'll be back next week again with a new Minecraft Weekly, it'll be Minecraft Weekly 71. So stay tuned for next Friday again. And don't forget to subscribe, get to comment, like and subscribe, I do read all the comments even if I don't reply. So see you then, thanks for watching, goodbye.","My name is Supremeo Pete, this custom map is getting annoying, I wonder if it's Minecraft weekly.

So let's go in and have a look and see what this looks like. And as you can see, it's pretty nice with the paintings already. I mean we've got a Notch Avatar painting there, kinda cool paintings. Here we have bookcases, bricks, TNT, pumpkins, ores, a chest, a nice UI there, here's a bed, glass, how I like it, gotta approve of that. This is normal stone. We have some soul sand and some, what's it called, Niverrack there, and glowstone. So let's go and have a look at some other UIs in the crafting room. Oh God! What the hell is going... What the...

But I mean, that sounds like something that can be addressed in the bill writing process. Right, and here's the real need of the situation. um... the definition was a major concern. Okay. All right. But again, the bill is coming back next year. Yeah. Um, Senate President Russell Pierce, uh, one of our strongest advocates in the United States, uh, will yet again run the bill next year. Um, we will address the state of concerns by the governor, which again, the concerns themselves, we recognize their opinion. We didn't feel we're an overwhelming issue, which is why we've just come to the point where we're going to agree to disagree. Yeah. All right.

Alors vous prenez le rôle d'une petite araignée et vous devez pisser vos toiles. Essayez de bouffer le plus d'insectes possibles plutôt. Donc l'écran de départ, on a différents modes de jeu donc on a aventure, explorer la maison, manger des insectes. 10 et partout, la grosse bouffe, 3 minutes, des insectes partout, battez votre record, famine, rassazir votre fin, ou vous mourez et moins de soie, filpez court jusqu'au point de se voiler pour précision. En fait ça c'est plutôt du puzzle game, le mode précision. Donc on va refaire le mode aventure. Donc dans le mode aventure, vous avez 28 niveaux, oui, 28 niveaux, voilà, c'est ça. et qui sont plus difficiles les uns que les autres. Donc on en a un peu saut commande. Donc vers la gauche, c'est simple, vous tapez sur l'écran à la gauche et vers la droite, c'est l'écran de droite. Pour sauter, c'est simplement, vous appuyez sur la ranière un peu et vous faites un gestac le doigt. C'est prêt pour tisser l'étoile. Vous appuyez un peu sur la ranière et on saut. Puis je pourrai faire trois points. pour que cette histoire soit une toile et que vous puissiez aller bouffer les insectes et faire des points. Donc là c'est le premier niveau donc c'est très court. On va passer au niveau suivant. Donc le jeu est vraiment prenant. C'est vraiment marrant à faire. C'est sur quoi je m'en dis, c'est super original. J'avais jamais vu de jeu comme ça depuis que je l'ai acheté. Moi je me mets vraiment bien. Il a un peu plus de 2 euros sur la Je ne sais plus exactement de 39 je crois. Et franchement dit, c'est sûr c'est un peu cher pour un jeu. Mais c'est vraiment, c'est vraiment, moi j'y joue pas mal depuis que je l'achete. J'aime beaucoup. Du Red Vibre, comme dit, 28 niveaux, plus 3 autres modes de jeu, il y a vraiment de quoi faire. Donc il y a eu 8 boulots derrière. Donc ils vaut son prix quand même. Alors il y a aussi possibilité de partager C'est score sur Facebook, pareil ça c'est vraiment sympa pour pouvoir déficier ses potes etc. Ça commence à être sur pas mal de jeux, mais c'est toujours une notion sympa à avoir. Voilà je crois que je fais un peu le tour, plaisir de plus, rien de social. Donc voilà, moi je vous le conseille, il y aura un lien en bas de la vidéo.

You take the role of a little spider and you have to pee on the canvas to try to eat as much as possible of insects as possible. So the starting screen, we have different game modes, so we have adventure, explore the house, eat insects. 10th, 3 minutes of the big food, beat your record, famine, race your end, move and less of yourself, run until you think about going for precision. In fact, it's more of a puzzle game, the precision mode. So we're going to do the adventure mode. In the adventure mode, you have 28 levels, yes, 28 levels, that's it. and they are harder than the others. We will jump to the left, you hit on the screen, to the left and to the right, it's the right screen. To jump, you just press on the ring a little and you do a gesture with your finger, ready for a little star, you press a little on the ring and jump. Then you will have to do three points. so you can make the insects and make points. So the game is really cool. It's really fun to do. It's super original. I've never seen a game like this before. I think it's worth it, but I like it a lot. It's a score on Facebook, it's really nice to be able to challenge your friends etc. Now it's going to be a lot of fun, but it's still a nice feeling to have. I think I'm doing a little bit of everything, pleasure of the plus, nothing social, nothing social. So here, I advise you, there will be a link below the video.

In fact, Alto White is really easy to use. and drink coffee and soda almost every day and alt-white is what great for me. teeth, which has great information on keeping your teeth white and also having an overall healthy mouth. All you have to do is send me a message with your confirmed order number and I'll email the book straight to you. So go ahead and make your order today."

I've gotten cancer, I have some lung and skin diseases like you remember so well. So we could use help with that. Asking them to, asking the VA to make sure they have a register set up. And I have told men and women you could tell them to, any vets that you know, to make sure they tell the doctors and don't just tell one, but tell them all that they were there, that they were exposed, that they were in theater because if they have a problem in 5 or 10 years, they've already been seen. a lot of neurological rashes and cancers, very rare cancers. So everybody's suspicious about it, but we really need to make sure that these men and women actually put themselves on record. So if anything happens, they have proof that they were there. You can go to burn pits, just type in burn pits, Google burn pits, and you will see everything about that. So because that group there, when we talked about undercounting and not having enough money for them, that group there, is going to need a lot more follow up and they're going to need a lot more money. the private sector is doing a lot of good work with veterans that they can they can they can contract with the government and so that's the other thing that we're looking into those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and on behalf of the 1.3 million people in New Hampshire thank you for your service thank you for your courage and thank you for your sacrifice now not all the soldiers are home yet the Iraq war may be over but the Afghanistan I think it's also important. This is a really good unifying event because regardless of your opinion of the war It's over if you supported the war then it's mission accomplished if you didn't support the war But you still supported the troops are happy their home if you didn't support the war and and that forbid you are against the troops, it's over.","What does this one say?

I've gotten cancer, I have some lung and skin diseases like you remember so well. So we could use help with that. Asking them to, asking the VA to make sure they have a register set up. And I have told men and women you could tell them to, any vets that you know, to make sure they tell the doctors and don't just tell one, but tell them all that they were there, that they were exposed, that they were in theater because if they have a problem in 5 or 10 years, they've already been seen. a lot of neurological rashes and cancers. Very rare cancers. So everybody's suspicious about it, but we really need to make sure that these men and women actually put themselves on record. So if anything happens, they have proof that they were there. You can go to burn pits. Just type in burn pits, Google burn pits, and you will see everything about that. So because that group there, when we talked about undercounting and not having enough money for them, that group there, is going to need a lot more follow-up and they're going to need a lot more money. the private sector is doing a lot of good work with veterans that they can they can they can contract with the government and so that's the other thing that we're looking into those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and on behalf of the 1.3 million people in New Hampshire thank you for your service thank you for your courage and thank you for your sacrifice now not all the soldiers are home yet the Iraq war may be over but the I think it's also important. This is a really good unifying event because regardless of your opinion of the war, it's over. If you supported the war, then it's mission accomplished. If you didn't support the war, but you still supported the troops, you're happy they're home. If you didn't support the war and you didn't support the war, then it's mission accomplished. and that forbid you are against the troops, it's over."

Certo, non mollano però le altre. Rammocon sapevoli perché arrivata alla fine non si poteva buttare un campionato così. Noi ci siamo raccolti e l'abbiamo pensato, penso che le avevano fatto anche le altre. Speriamo il risultato del Verona e del Torino, poi andiamo avanti. Penso che il gioco del mister ha gevolatato noi attaccanti. Ovviamente c'è più occasione in una partita come appato Quindi sono contento, ringrazio il miss e ringrazio anche gli altri perché anche merito degli altri dei miei 27 goal. Andiamo avanti, speriamo di continuare così fino alla fine. Il miss poi scherza sempre, però come si dice, nello scherzo si dice sempre un po' di verità. Ha detto che sarebbe una scena di far alimentare se non arriva a 30 goal. Cerco di accontentarlo. Ti sta succedendo che il pescara rischia di andare in Serie A, invece il Genoa, boh! Se la lottano fino alla fine...","Did you get a double or a single goal? How do you do it? It's the same. I got the win twice. I'm happy with what I did. What should we say? Is it your goal or your goal? It's my goal. So it's 27 goals. 27? Yes. But the three games of the game don't make it to the top. Is that the most important aspect? Yes, I agree. I think that even for the confidence that the defenders and Luca could have for the last games, where we had a bad time in the defence, we're happy with everything we're doing. The coach is happier than everyone thinks. We're doing well, we're back first and we're happy. Of course they don't give up, but the others do. We were conscious because we couldn't throw ourselves in a change of pace. We picked up and thought about it, they did it too. We expect the result of Verona and Torino, then we move on. I think the game of the coach is very active, we're attacking. Obviously there are more chances in a game like Pato I'm happy, I thank the coach and the others because they deserve the 27 goals. We're moving forward, we hope to continue like this until the end. The coach always jokes, but as he says, jokes always tell you the truth. He said he would be a good fooder if he didn't reach 30 goals. I'm trying to make him happy. It's happening that Pescara can go to Serie A, but Genoa... What do you think will happen next? There are times when teams will be in the top. I think they're a good team. They're fighting against Leicester, which is a loss for them too. They'll fight until the end."

Do you want to make out some more? Okay. I just feel like... like we don't have anything in common. You never talk to me about your feelings, your hopes and dreams. I'm feeling like I hope you shut up soon. Do you want to make out some more? Not really. I should have doubted the will of Mike and Brian. That's okay. Azula hurt me emotionally and physically."

Я пользуюсь услуга Европейской иеридической службы. Я являюсь ее клиентом. И за 7 месяцев произошло действительно очень много уже приятных историй, результатов, каким образом Европейская иеридическая служба помогла нашим близким друзьям, знакомстям, числе и нам, решить свои как просто мелкие бытовые проблемы, так и серьезные глобальные проблемы. получается что европейская реческая служба помогает даже влиять на дальнейшую судьбу человека ну вот допустим одна из историй случилась с нами буквально недавно мы ехали перед Новым годом из Таврополя и решили поехать в ночь то есть мы часов 12 выехали из Таврополя и за эти четыре часа пути так случилось что но по всей видимости при новогодней празднике и зарабатывать нужно всем А что с работниками ГИБДД? Они нас останавливают, причем стоят в неосвященном месте и начнут предъявлять, что оказывается мы пересекли преливе сту линию, но она была там какая-то уже большая, ее нельзя было пересекать. Другая разметка была. И начинают предъявлять, на что мы им говорим, ребята, вы стоите в неосвященном месте, где вообще ваш... Как это называется? Предписание. Предписание, ваш номер же тона и так далее. Они поняли, что мы на них наезжать начинаем и начали ответ на хамить, кричать, угрожать, говорить, что вы садитесь в машину, мы сейчас свою поедем до поста и там разберемся. Мы поняли, что решать надо ситуацию на месте, никуда мы не поедем, плюс вообще какое право кто-то имеет нас повышать голос. Как себя вести? В тот же час мы позвонили в Европейскую рюдеческую службу уже по опыту и знанию, я взяла блокнот, ручку вышла из машины и подошла к машине ГАИ. Я сейчас позвоню своему адвокату. Я за него обеспечиваю ситуацию. Что стоят там-то, там-то, там-то. Вот такая ситуация. Угрожает все такое. На что мне Юрия Северописческая служба попросила спросить у сотрудников ГИБД. Какое правонарушение они нам меняют? Ну это было все юридическим языком, я уже не помню дословно. На что сотрудники ИВД поняли, что Они сразу поменяли свою технику обращать о смертность на дорогах поэтому они нас остановили исключительно для того чтобы проконсультировать и провести разъяснительную работу для того чтобы не дай бог мы никуда-то не пофаль. Это называется они оправдывались почему они сделали так что что мы на них потратили время при этом это было в час ночи сейчас ночью ситуация была конечно смешная ну она была бы не смешная если бы у вас не было этой услуги однозначно однозначно но час ночи мы стоим на дороге и Гаишники читают нам, как будто бы усап, читают на протяжении 8 минут без перерыва. Четко, молодец, случил, хорошо. Когда Езивисия Пескоридческая служба все это прослушал, тоже им было слышно как тут разговаривать. Он говорит, ну все, они вам уже как бы ничего не предъявляют. Скажите, спасибо, ежайте. Мы благодарили Пескоридческую службу, не успели мы им сказать спасибо, они нам сами сказали, что вдруг что-то случилось, а вот мы нас остановили, ничего не случилось. Да, они очень добрысовательны стали. Очень интересный пример. Ну и вообще примеры сотрудники ИБДД очень много, конечно. Ну я много уже интервью говорил, и почти все рассказывают именно историю связанных с ГИБДД. Ну потому что служба такая интересная у нас, все это правильно. А вот какие-то другие истории интересные можете рассказать? Конкретная ситуация, мы сейчас находимся в Египте. Если бы у меня не было карточки европейской рючской службы, я бы наверняка испытывал определенный стресс. в июне месяц заканчивается срок за гранпаспорта а слухов же много и по одним слухам мне сказали что если паспорт заканчивается раньше чем полгода за полгода то за границу тебя не пустит и вот здесь возникает вопрос правда это не правда как себя вести менять паспорт не менять то есть много всякие такие вот ситуации поэтому я просто позвонил европейскую южную службу в течение двух минут мне объяснили что спросили в какую страну еду когда я выезжаю В России или Числы, к ним сказали, что в Кургаду вы можете ехать, у вас проблем не будет, потому что в Египет, если есть еще хотя бы два месяца, а до окончания паспорта вы можете ехать в Египет. Я не знаю, как на счет другой страны, я не спрашивал. Я думал, если бы это была другая страна, меня тоже проконцентировали, как мне себя вести в данной ситуации. Однозначно, да. То есть, во-первых, это не было никакого стресса, не было никакого напряжения, экономия куча времени. То есть, это было легко, просто и комфортно. А одна ситуация была такая комичная. Мы вечером с Татьяной были в супермаркете, кстати, с нами, как раз, иринат находился, это где было уже полдесятого вечера. И нам уже был наполнитель для кошки купить. Мы купили супермаркет и наполнитель, при этом он был дорогой какой-то, и качество у него такое было сомнительное. А выбора никакой не было, пришлось купить его. Только мы вышли, оплатив его и вышли из супермаркета, а там открылся новое отдел для кошек и собак и увидели.","Good afternoon, my name is Tatiana Disney. I use the service of the European Rural Service. I am its client. And in seven months, a lot of nice stories and results have come up. How the European Rural Service helped our close friends, including us, to solve their small problems, serious global problems. It turns out that European health service helps even affect the future of the fate of the person. Well, let's say one of the stories happened to us recently. We drove to Stavropol in the new year and decided to go at night. We drove at 12 o'clock in Stavropol and for these four hours of the journey, it happened so that, apparently, during the New Year holidays, everyone needs to earn money. They stopped us 5 times. They were worried that we would be in trouble. They stopped us more often so that we wouldn't be in trouble. They stop us, and we are standing in the place of the priest. They start to show us that we crossed the line, but it was already big and we couldn't cross it. It was a different mark. They start to show us what we are talking about. Guys, stand in the place of the priest. Where is your... What is your name? The sign. Your number is a ton. They understood that we were going to find them and started to say something. They shouted, shouted, threatened us, saying that we were going to get our car and we were going to put it there and we would sort it out. We understood that we had to decide the situation in a place, we wouldn't go anywhere. Plus, what right does someone have to make a voice out of us? As always. We immediately called the European Human Services, and I took the notebook and the pen, got out of the car and came to the car. I called the lawyer and told him that I was in a situation where the situation was very serious. I was asked to ask the GVD employees what the right to break the law was. They immediately changed their technique. They stopped us to consult and do some real work so that we don't go anywhere. They were justified. Why did they do it? We spent time on them. It was at 1 am. The situation was funny. It was not funny if you didn't have it. It was definitely. We were standing on the road and we were looking for a way to get to the city. The police officers read us as if they were in a suburb. They were waiting for 8 minutes without a break. Well done, you did well. When the TV station was listening to the police, he was also very happy. He said, they are not afraid of anything. Thank you, Vika. Thank you, go. We thanked the police station. They didn't have time to say thank you. They told us that something happened, we stopped. Nothing happened. Yes, they became very kind. Very interesting example. And generally, there are a lot of examples from the staff of IBD, of course. I have already interviewed a lot of people and almost everyone tells the story of the connection with the IBD. Because the service is so interesting in us, everything is correct. Can you tell us some other interesting stories? I have a period of time for a passport. I have heard a lot about it. If the passport ends before six months, then you will not be allowed to abroad. And here comes the question. Is it true or not? How to behave yourself? Change the passport or not? There are many such situations. So I just called the European Economic Service for two minutes. They explained to me that they asked me which country I was going to go to. I don't know how it will be in Egypt, but I think if it were another country, I would be consulted as well. First of all, there was no stress, no tension, but I had a lot of time. And there was a new department for cats and dogs. The result was great. The price was good, but not at high quality. We didn't need the one we just bought. We had to return it. I came to the cashier and told me that we can't return it and we can't give money. I said how it is and then the manager came. The manager said that we can't. I was asked to call my lawyer and they told me to choose the option that you will return to the employer. I said my option because Tatiana came to the Senate. I said that the owner of the window and the employer had an allergy. I was literally turned back by money for a minute. Again, no stress, no time saving and no headache. Yes, it was already half past ten in the evening."

Everybody's always asking me about what's better, tractor or serato, because I'm always using vinyl. So this time I'm going to test tractor, and I'm going to test serato at the same time. Equal playing fields, it's got the same mixer, it's just got a little faceplate on it. Same computer, that one's just black, that one's white. So everything's equal. This is a tractor record, this is a serato record, and on the other side of this tractor record, this is vinyl with a bunch of sounds on here. Let's see. So this side's vinyl. Do some chirps on that and then this is the tractor side. Now we'll test that same chirp. This is a Serato. We'll do chirping. Pretty cool so far. Now we're going to do, let's go back to vinyl. We're going to do some one-click flares. We're doing this because those are kind of like the main detailed scratches. So now we're on tractor vinyl. One click flares. Pretty good, pretty good. Pretty good. So tractor and serato are pretty much equal. Now let's test some slow stuff. Let's try it on vinyl. Actually let's test that fresh on, if it was going slow. Let's test the fresh on this. It's pretty good. Let's test the fresh on this one. It sounds a little digital if you could really hear it, but it starts to kind of like fuzz out a little bit. But that's cool too if you want that little effect. What else is there? What can we do here? Those are pretty much the main things like you can really scratch really good on both. Let's try that over here. So all the fast scratches you can pretty much do and you won't even tell. You can't even see a difference. Here a difference. One thing I noticed about Serato is if you leave the needle on the record with the power off, it kind of vibrate the turns and moves a little bit. Now over here on tractor, you leave it. doesn't make those sounds. It doesn't move around at all. So that's pretty good. So little tiny differences. I mean if you're juggling and you leave the record on it might make those noises. You can always turn it off or whatever if you're using Serato. But just kind of like a minor thing. All right so there you have it. Tractor. Serato. Pretty much couldn't tell the difference. If I was blindfolded I wouldn't know what the hell you were using. Unless you're going super slow as you've seen earlier, but you know who the hell's gonna do that? Well, maybe yeah, maybe you probably be doing that if you do some real super funky slow scratches, but It's not really much of a big difference. I mean there's a lot of advantages that Serato has scratch video hook it up Ableton and all this cool stuff tractor Sonically you can do a lot more stuff because it has all these weird effects There's more people in Europe use tractor. There's more people in the US you serato serato's like you know, mix mask mine, short cut, the list goes on. Tractor, we got ATRAC, craze, Rafique. You know, I like to use both, but sonically I'm a little more, I probably would go with tractor just because I like all the effects on it and stuff. But like I said, I got both. It's great to have both because you can hook it up to different things. But what can I say, you know, they're both great things. I mean, tractor is like 100 bucks more. so it might kind of like be a little too expensive so if you get Serato it's still pretty good.","Yo, what up y'all?

Much of this work has come from patient volunteers who have agreed to be in our studies and who have agreed to do some of the testing that we've required of them. Specifically, we've actually studied how mobile people are in their normal daily life. And so we've taken devices that are used for research as well as for commercial purposes such as an accelerometer which is a fancy pedometer which measures how physically active you are and how many steps you take or a cellular tracking device which measures where you go and how much time you spend away from home. People who have substantial visual field loss in both eyes, we found that they walk roughly one-third as much as an individual who has normal vision. We've also looked at how glaucoma affects reading. slower, but that you can't capture this by the test of reading that have normally been used. It's really captured in how somebody reads a book over a long period of time. And indeed we have made our own book to test how somebody might sustain their reading over 20 or 30 minutes in a silent fashion. So the next step is again, how can we rehabilitate this?

We're not simply interested in diseases here. We're interested in the people who have these diseases and making them as healthy, as happy, and their quality of life as high as possible.","A major focus of our work at the Glaucoma Center of Excellence here at Johns Hopkins Wilmer has been to understand how people are disabled by glaucoma and eventually to rehabilitate them, not only by preventing them from losing further vision, but also by making them more functional with whatever vision they may have left. Much of this work has come from patient volunteers who have agreed to be in our studies and who have agreed to do some of the testing that we've required of them. Specifically, we've actually studied how mobile people are in their normal daily life. And so we've taken devices that are used for research as well as for commercial purposes such as an accelerometer which is a fancy pedometer which measures how physically active you are and how many steps you take or a cellular tracking device which measures where you go and how much time you spend away from home. People who have substantial visual field loss in both eyes we found that they walk roughly one-third as much as an individual who has normal vision. We've also We've also looked at how glaucoma affects reading. slower, but that you can't capture this by the test of reading that have normally been used. It's really captured in how somebody reads a book over a long period of time. And indeed, we have made our own book to test how somebody might sustain their reading over 20 or 30 minutes in a silent fashion. So the next step is again, how can we rehabilitate this? In what way can we make books better? Can we make texts better so that these tasks, which are so important to everyday life, can be done more efficiently and more easily?

Acompanyat per l'alcalde de Camprodon i varis regidors , va anar visitant diferents actuacions que es van engegar quan ell ocupava la presidència de Catalunya. A més a més va visitar el monòlit amb una poesia escrita pel seu avi que es troba a la Font de Sant Patllari. Havent dinat i un cop recuperats de la caminada del matí, van fer una visita a la fàbrica galetes Birba.","Vall de Camprodon, Vall de camprodon tv, Pasqual Maragall, Camprodon, Maragall",151,1,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/gVtP-DcSoF0.mp3,"Fic molt content avui de tenir entre nosaltres el president Maragall a Camprodon, una visita que ens complou molt i que té un doble significat. Hem vingut aquí a la font de Sant Pallari on hi ha una poesia del seu avi, Joan Maragall. Recordem-ho, estem dins l'any Maragall, que Camprodon s'hi ha adherit i forma part del comitè que organitza actes per recordar el gran poeta i que amb aquesta font, Cristiu Cabetindrem, un recital de poesia lligada amb la poesia que és la Fonda Sant Pallari. I que, per tant, que avui el president Maragall estigui aquí, allò que el seu avi es va inspirar amb aquestes boniques paraules, ens complau molt. També hem aprofitat el dia per ensenyar-li obres que van poder realitzar sota el seu mandat, tant la llar de infants com el Passeix Maristany, que, sense l'ajut indispensable i vital de la Generalitat, ha estat impossible afrontar-hi, que, en aquest cas, i ha estat un bon servei per tots els nens i nenes de Camprodona i de la Valle de Camprodona. I el tema passeix Manistàn, que era una dels peces claus, una mica la joia de la corona, de Camprodona, d'aquell urbanisme de principi de segle, poder posar el dia en condició en cèntr-te transformar va ser captar l'ajut que vam rebre per part del seu govern. Aquest any és el centenari de la mort de Maragall, el 150 aniversari del seu nasiment. i em direu, sort, sort, hem tingut d'això, perquè, curiosament, Maragall és molt parlat però vol discutir-te el mateix temps i molt oblidat, no? I si aneu a l'Àxiu Maragall, ja el carrer el fons 12.79, us ho recomano que aneu, perquè és com a casa de l'avi, el piano de l'avi, les fotografies, la sala d'estat, etcètera, etcètera. En fi, finalment, he posat a la plaça Bolínel les tàps del Maragall, que és molt... que ha estat moltíssim, però al final hem posat... que ho queda convidat, tots els per qui d'al, i a la Tota Catalunya que visitin la ciutat, perquè em penso que si tornarem vida i recuperarem tota una tradició d'aquest país que crec que no es pot perdre.","I am very happy to have, among us, Mayor Maragall, a visit that I really appreciate and that has a double meaning. We have come here to the Samp-Pallari fund, where there is a poetry of the owner, Joan Maragall. We remember that we are in Maragall, Mayor, and he is part of the committee that organizes acts to remind the great poet that with this fund, Christiu Cabet, we will have a poetry recital connected with poetry. and the mountains, which are the source of the San Pallari. So, today, President Maragalli is here, where his friend was inspired by these beautiful words. We also took the opportunity to teach him works that he could do under his command, both in the childhood and in the Maristan past, which without the help of the essential and vital of the Generalitat, was impossible to face. and it was a good survey for the children's yard for all the children and grandchildren of Camp Rodó and the University of Camp Rodó. The theme was the manistan, which was one of the key pieces of the crown jewel of Camp Rodó, of that early urbanism of the century, so it was possible to put the day in a condition without transforming it, so it was to be captured, the help we received from the government. This year is the centenary of the death of Maragall, the 150th anniversary of his birth. I would say that if this year We have had luck with that, because we have talked a lot about it, but we want to discuss it at the same time, we have forgotten it. If you go to the city of Maragallia, you will see the 1279-Galveston road. I recommend you go because it is like the house of the AVI, the AVI piano, the photographs, the stadium hall, etc. Finally, we have put the Plaza Molina, the city of Maragallia, which has been very much, but in the end we have put it in the way I think that I have to invite all the people who come to visit the city because I think that if we live together and recover the whole tradition of this country I think we will lose."

So I'm going to start with the body lotion. I haven't used loads of this because I don't want to use it because I want to save it for special occasions but it is absolutely stunning. The lid just pops up like that. It smells exactly like the fragrance and it's one of those ones where you put it on and you can smell it for days. You get into bed and you smell it on your sheets for like It's amazing, I love it, it's so nice, it's a shame when you have to shower and you can smell it in the shower like when you wash it off. This comes in the 200ml and to be honest I generally think that having a body lotion with a fragrance is just really useful because I don't use the shower gels that come with them. A lot of them do come with shower gels and some of them even come with like two shower gels which seems completely unnecessary to me. I don't really use shower gels that much compared to body lotion. So obviously for me a body lotion was really handy and if you want this, I know for a fact that boots do it on its own. So you can buy this on its own from boots anyway but I think it's probably around 20 pounds. So yeah, if you want this you can buy it individually or you can buy it in the gift set. So that is really nice. I absolutely love it. and then I'm going to get onto the fragrance and what I love about this fragrance is that it's so different from any other fragrance like the the fact that it is like so blatantly and licorice I love it and it's obviously got vanilla in there and I love vanilla vanilla is like one of my favorite smells ever and it's really nice oh my god it is so amazing like amazing I just can't get over how nice it is It's nice that it comes as a 50 mil because I know a lot of gift sets come with a 30 mil So it's nice to get something a bit bigger this time round and I love the packaging packaging packaging is just really cute It's really cute purple heart and yeah, I love it. I don't really know what else to say I mean, this is like the perfect gift for like any woman and Well, I say any woman but any woman that loves this fragrance because you either love this fragrance or you hate it so And to be honest, I'd say it's more of a youthful fragrance, to be honest. Just because it is so sweet, I know that older women tend to prefer something a bit more floral. So yeah, it's perfect for probably from the age of like 40, 15, or 30s, 40s maybe. But you know, typically it's down to you like whatever you like. I mean, I love it. Absolutely love it. So it is one of my favorite fragrances. It is my most reached for fragrance out of my fragrances. And I actually did a video on my fragrance collection which I will link down here. I only have five at the minute so it's not the biggest collection compared to some people. But there are nice fragrances. Like I have this one and the Lady Million which are like my two premium fragrances. And then I have like some cheaper ones like the Tommy Hilfiger I have quite a nice variety even though I don't have many. But anyway, that is, I don't really know what else to say. I pretty much have covered it in like, what, like a couple of minutes. Um, like, I don't know how long this video is. I can't tell on my camera. So, but yeah, I've pretty much covered it. Um, perfect gift. This actually cost me just under 30 pounds. I know for a fact that the 30 mil of this on its own is around 32 pounds So that was a right steal really if you think about it So yeah always look after Christmas and always look for the bargains especially in fragrance So I hope this was useful to you guys and let me know what you think of the fragrance because I absolutely love it Let me know what your favorite fragrances are and whether you want me to do any other fragrance videos Yeah, if you have any requests at all just post them in a comment below and I will see you guys soon.

Sa talentovanim fudbalerima oba kluba zaigrao je i Boban Džunić, predsednik Gradske opštine Palilula, koji je do nedavno aktivno i uspešno trenirao i igrao fudbal u FK ""Radnički"", „Železničar"", „Jastrebac"", „Sloga""(„Car Konstantin""). Sportski susret i druženje fudbalera dva kluba bila je prava promocija ovog sporta ali i zdravog načina života, o čemu se danas sve više govori i ističe kao prioritet posebno u radu sa omladinom. Bavljenje sportom, po rečima Bobana Džunića nije rezervisano samo za vrhunske sportiste, to treba da usvojimo kao stil života, potrebu da pomažemo i podstičemo amaterski sport i rekreaciju naših građana. U projektima koje ostvaruje opština Palilula uz podršku Evropske unije u okviru programa susedske saradnje Bugarska--Srbija, upravo se afirmišu ovi ciljevi u našem regionu. Predsednik Džunić je sa članovima kluba ""Moravac"" razgovarao i o uslovima rada ovog sportskog kolektiva kao i o organizovanju fudbalske utakmice u humanitarne svrhe u okviru akcije opštine „Pomozimo našoj deci"".

One of them is Moravac from the top of Medjurovo. We all need to know that it is not only a first league sport, but that it is necessary to spread the spirit of the club, help the village clubs. As for me, the city council has not yet implemented its own example of giving me the knowledge that we will meet them, but I call on all those city fathers to start this sport at this level, not only the first league sport. In addition to the financial aid of the club of the top of Medjurov, you will see the improvement in the Slava Zarad. We need to help in technical conditions, we see that they have no good performance here, we will try to have it possible. The municipality of Paljula helped Moravac and in the Greek cadre. President of this municipality Boban Junic was in the composition of the team of Gorniy Medjurov, at the pre-trial of the attack, where Moravac played with the Medoševački youth."

Bueno, se decidió crear una agrupación justamente para torcerle la muñeca a Federaciones y decirle que Acá había un sector de trabajadores importante, con otra mentalidad que quería oponerse a la decisión y al pensamiento de Federación que era en ese momento un pensamiento totalmente contradictorio a lo que marcaba el convenio, a lo que marcaba los beneficios del trabajador petrolero. Entonces justamente por eso se escribió esta agrupación para tratar de buscar y conseguir nuevos beneficios para el afiliado petrolero. Yo le pediría a todos los petroleros, más que nada, que tengan paciencia, que el sindicato lo vamos a recuperar, lo vamos a recuperar tarde o temprano, no falta mucho para esto. Creemos también como agrupación que tenemos la posibilidad de tener un sindicato elegido por trabajadores que sea totalmente funcional para los trabajadores que de una vez por todas se termine con la corrupción sindical creemos que somos capaces y estamos capacitados para lograr un sindicato que de una vez por todas se concentre en lograr nuevas conquistas en cuanto a grandes beneficios que pueden tener los trabajadores petroleros y su familia. Queremos copiar del que hizo bien las cosas, por ejemplo el sindicato de Núñez, el sindicato de Chubot, y tratar por medio de un futuro bloque patagónico que esta agrupación petrolera lo va a integrar, traer beneficios de las otras provincias petroleras germanas a la localidad de Las Heras, Pico Truncado, Caleta Olivia y Río Gallego.","It's very simple, the name of the group of the St. Croisenea Petroleum, as each of the different seeds of the four localities says, together with the name chosen, which was chosen by the assembly, by a group of workers, and it's precisely because it covers all the workers of Petroleum, that's why the group of the St. Croisenea Petroleum, the province of Santa Cruz, is not for all the workers of Petroleum. Well, it was decided to create a group, to support the Moñecca Federación and tell them Here there was a sector of important workers with another mentality that would oppose the decision and the federation thought, which was at that time a totally contradictory thought to what the co-public, what the benefits of the oil worker would mark. So, precisely because of that this group was created to try to find and get new benefits for the oil company. I would ask all the oil workers, more than anything, to be patient, We will recover the syndicate as soon as possible. We believe that we have the possibility of having a syndicate chosen by workers, that it is totally functional for workers, that once and for all it is finished with the syndicate corruption. We believe that we are capable and we are capable to achieve a syndicate that once and for all concentrates on achieving new conquests, as long as we are great, the benefits that the oil workers and their families can have. We want to copy what I saw in the things, for example, the UNQED syndicate, the Chubot syndicate, and to treat it through a future Patagonian block, which this oil group will integrate, bringing benefits from other German oil provinces to the locality of Las Seras, this Pico Truncado, Caleta Oliva and Río Gallego."

Perché anche per un uomo è importante oggi scendere in piazza? perché contrariamente a quello che pensano molti o alcuni questo momento di festa per tutti e non per una parte ristretta dell'Italia e del mondo intero secondo me. Oggi 13 febbraio le donne d'Italia scendono in piazza per dire no al modello femminile propugnato dalla massima carica del governo italiano. Non è solo la massima carica del modello del governo italiano è tutta una cultura maschile la giornata di oggi non sarà l'unico episodio quali saranno i prossimi appuntamenti? l'unico episodio, certamente ci troveremo il 19 febbraio poi ci troveremo ancora marzo e ci saranno via via vari appuntamenti che continueranno se non ora quando continuerà finché avremo visto il risultato di una diversa mentalità che si fa strada finalmente. L'importanza di scendere in piazza oggi è il 13 febbraio. L'importanza di scendere in piazza oggi è l'importanza di scendere come donne e come lesbiche. e l'importanza di dire che la donna, così come viene rappresentata in questa società, non è quello che poi la donna effettivamente è, è riprendersi uno spazio che ci viene negato. E ci viene negato non soltanto all'interno del rubi gate, che è semplicemente un particolarismo e sarebbe una cosa stemporanea. È uno spazio che ci viene negato più ampiamente, in una maniera trasversale a livello sociale. Noi come lesbiche, oggi ci siamo poi in particolar modo perché il nostro essere lesbiche sottolinea ancora di più un'identità della donna che valdi là della definizione della donna soltanto accompagnato un uomo. Nel nostro paese accade il massime carico dello Stato, il Presidente del Consiglio, esidisca ostenti per la modernità di rapporto fra le donne e gli uomini, profondamente lesiva della dignità delle donne e anche della dignità degli uomini e della dignità delle istituzioni. che è un momento in cui la divisione della moralismo ipocrita, tra donne per bene e donne per male, che ne paga le conseguenze sulla propria pelle, sono proprio quelle donne che vivono del autodeterminate del loro lavoro sessuale e non lo fanno per potere, non lo fanno per moralismo, non lo fanno per ipocrisia, è una loro scenta e noi abbiamo deciso di sostenere anche loro che vivono, che sazioni vivono le ordinanze degli cerifi che le vogliono relegare negli bui delle città le vogliono metterli i vittori cespugli preferì a una vergogna invece dobbiamo difendere le nostre donne ma non quelle a noi e a chi ci chiede perché essere qui oggi rispondiamo che ci siamo perché partiamo da noi e vogliamo che soggette emergenti da una decimazione plurale che ci comprenda a tutti e a tutti e a tutti migranti per cari e femministe non lesbiche transessuali intersexi in altre parole no grazie","Why is it important to go down to the square today? It is important to go down to the square because men should do it because men should be ashamed of their sexual acts that behave as they behave. So we are in the substitution of men. Thank you. Today it is important to go down to the square to defend the rights of the woman and to go away also for the scones. This is the most important thing. Why is it important to go down to the square today even for a man? Because contrary to what many think, this is a moment of celebration for everyone and not for a restricted part of the whole world. Today, February 13, Italian women are going to the square to say no to the female model proposed by the maximum load of the Italian government. The day of today will not be the only episode. What will be the next appointment? We will find the only episode, we will find the 19th of February, then we will find March, and we will have various appointments that will continue. If not now, when will it continue? Until we have seen the result of a different mentality that is being spread out. Finally. The importance of going down to the square today is the 13th of February. The importance of going down to the square today is the importance of going down as women and as lesbians. It is important to say that women, as represented in this society, is not what women are. It is to take up a space that is denied to us. It is denied not only within Rubygate, it is simply a particularism and it would be a temporary thing. It is a space that is denied to us more widely, in a transversal way, on the social level. We as lesbians, today we are in a particular way, because our being lesbians, which is even more subject to, women's identity, which is beyond the definition of women, I have accompanied a man. And we are here today, as always, next to you, to support the rights of women who have conquered the state with so much effort. I want to say to our children who have chosen to grow up in a country, we have grown up in Italy because it is a country that respects women. Thank you. In our country, the highest position of the State, the President of the Council, is to say, obediently, that the majority of the relationship between women and men is deeply ill, of the life of women and also of the life of men and of the life of institutions. The red candle is the symbol of the Committee of the Judicial Rights of the Constitution. This is the moment when the division of apocrytal moralism between women for good and women for bad, who pay for the consequences on their own skin, are the women who live self-determined of their sexual work and do not do it for power, do not do it for moralism, do it for hypocrisy. It is their choice. And we have decided to support them too, who live in sanctions, who live the ordinance of the sheriffs, who want to re-legate them in the Bui, the city, they want to put the spills on you, they prefer a shame, instead we have to defend our women, but not those! To us, who asks us why we are here today? We answer that we are here because it starts from us and we want that urgent suggestion of the plural declaration that is understood by all of us, all of us, migrants, precarious, feminist and non-lesbian, trans-social, intersex, in other words, no! Thank you!"

Yeah, liberal radio talk show host Ed Shultz and conservative radio talk show host Steve Malzberg are going to go toe-to-toe on this one. All right, Steve, since you're sitting on the couch, I'll let you take the first stab. Obama, I mean, he's telling the truth because Hillary Clinton and came from behind and su ham shirt and the polls are now t case, you know, the presiden always gets tighter. You w win by two. You have a 16 po win by three or four. It's b at the internals of the gala as you guys alluded to earlier. with likely voters. The, the all the polls.

They've known all along that this is a marathon and not a sprint. This is still a long haul. There's an eternity left before this election.

I was in Madison, Wisconsin the other night and had a town hall meeting and I have to say that a lot of people are pretty confident right now, but they also know that they got across this finish line.

Oh, he doesn't make $250,000. What's he worried about? Biden says, I don't know any Joe the plumbers. The point is this guy wants to buy a small business. So what if 1% of them only make $250,000 a year? The goal is you want to succeed. You want to do better 100% of them want to make more than that. So Obama is saying, if you do, I'm going to take that money and I'm going to spread it around. So no incentive to do better. He takes the incentive out of America. That's Marxism, my friend. Marxism. Ed? Well, let me speak from experience. EA's Schultz Construction is a company run by my two boys. And I can tell you that we've looked at both plans. We really like the Obama plan.

Did you see that? Sure. Hey, hold on. Anybody here, let me ask you, anybody here at the Miranda restaurant, will anybody be walking off during your segment? No, of course not. What are you, nuts? And, and, and, oh man, if he can't take little Steve Malzberg. I tell you, see, we got a call from that construction company he has, there's no more cement, he's got to go, something must have happened, you know. YouTube. All right. Imagine if he was traveling in the pool. My pleasure. Steve, just for equal. Would you storm off, please? I'm out of here, baby. I think that was actually a ploy. Everyone's mad at us. Yeah. Brian, now usually you leave. Right. So could you leave now too, please? All right, fine. Listen to Steve's story. And then everyone will think that you really are mad. That's the way that we're going to. Steve, why don't you leave? Wait a minute. You're asking Brian to leave and not me to leave? Are you crazy? I can't stand for that. All right, why don't you take it? Coming up on the show."

Hoy tenemos un programa muy variado pero lo vamos a empezar con este fortownos que tengo aquí atrás mío de la década de 60 para aquellos que tienen más de 40 estos autos en su momento han sido muy vistos en nuestras calles pero hoy realmente es una pieza bastante escasa. Los más jóvenes seguramente que asocian el nombre de fortownos al modelo que empezó a fabricar en 1974, aquí en nuestro país, formó Torre de Argentina. Pero yo les puedo asegurar que este modelo tiene muchísimos años de vida anterior, así que lo que me gustaría hacer inicialmente es un pequeño raconto de la vida del Fortauno. Este modelo nace en 1939, ya justo comenzada la Segunda Guerra Mundial, para reemplazar al Forreiffel, también fabricado por la subsidiaria Forre en Alemania. Este modelo deja de fabricarse en 1942 y hasta el en 1948, obviamente por causas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, luego en 1948, cuando la economía alemana se estabilizó y empezaron a necesitar otra vez de la movilidad cotidiana, el Fort Taunus reapareció. Y una de las particularidades que tiene este modelo es que después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial se decidió llamarlo simplemente Taunus, por lo cual en un solo lugar del auto vamos a encontrar que está identificado con la marca Ford, pero el auto era de la línea Taunus y obviamente pertenecía a la fábrica subsidiaria de de Ford Motor Company en Alemania. Esta nueva gama de Fortaunus también se desdobló en dos subgamas, una grande y una pequeña. La gama pequeña estaba compuesta por el modelo 12 y 15 m, o sea, con motores de 1200 y 1500 cm cúbicos, y la gama grande por el modelo 17 m, 20 m y 26 m, o sea, 1700, 2000 y 2600 cm cúbicos. Los tres primeros modelos, 1200, 1400 y 1700, utilizaban motores de cuantos centímetros cúbicos. 4 cilindros en línea que más tarde fueron reemplazados por motores B4, mientras que el 20 y el 26, o sea el 2 litros y el 2 litros 600 durante toda su vida fueron motores B6. Todos los modelos taunus desde 1952 hasta 1960 tenían mucha influencia de los automóviles americanos, obviamente o principalmente de los automóviles de la marca Ford. Pero a partir de 1960, como es este modelo, empiezan a tener un estilo mucho más europeo. Autos mucho más armoniosos con diseños no tan estridentes o llamativos como los autos americanos y con cosas más particulares de la necesidad del mercado europeo. Sin embargo, este modelo, que es denominado 17M P3, que es de la tercera generación del 17M, tiene una trompa muy similar a algún Thunderbird de la época, pero obviamente con dimensiones más pequeñas. Este modelo, como dijimos inicialmente, 17M ha sido de alusión a la motorización que utilizaba que era 1700 este modelo ofrecía motores 1500, 1700 y 1800 cm cc con potencias que iban desde los 60 hasta los 70 caballos este motor es un motor como dijimos también de cuatro cilindros en línea con válvulas a la cabeza utiliza un carburador solex de 32 y obviamente tiene tracción trasera por eso hay muchos de los que se han utilizado en el modelo Estos autos también ofrecían distintas variantes en cuanto a carrocería. El sedán podía venir con dos o con cuatro puertas. Había una versión convertible muy atractiva, de la cual se fabricaron muy pocas unidades y también había una rural. Desde el momento de la construcción de los autos, la construcción de los autos fue muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy muy Hay cosas que que me parecen los Ritchmans. y una versión deportiva que utilizaba una caja de cuarta al piso y utilizaba dos butacas adelante. Estos autos también con este asiento enterizo tienen mucha semejanza con los automóviles americanos de serie, obviamente con el Forfalkon que también utilizaba una caja muy similar y el clásico asiento enterizo que siempre fue bien americano. Como les dije al principio de la nota estos autos fueron muy vistos acá en la década de 60, obviamente estaba abierta la importación por lo cual cada uno podía traer cualquier tipo de auto de marcas incluso que no existieran aquí en el país. Pero lo interesante que tiene este modelo es que no tiene ninguna adaptación para auto de discapacitado, porque la mayoría de estos autos alemanes que llegaban a nuestro país llegaban con alguna adaptación para personas discapacitadas. En ese momento los distintos bancos otorgaban créditos con muchos beneficios para personas que tuvieran algún problema de movilidad y con un certificado que se presentaba aquí y se mandaba Alemania, la fábrica lo preparaba de acuerdo al tipo de problema que tuviera cada persona, si fuera en las piernas o en los brazos, derecho o izquierdo estos autos venían preparados específicamente para cada problema que tuviera cada persona casi en particular. Así que vuelvo a repetir, este auto es uno de los pocos que no ha venido para discapacitados, por lo cual es un auto normal de serie como se vendían en Alemania en esa época.

Today we have a very varied program but we are going to start with this Ford Towns that I have here behind me from the 60s for those who have more than 40 these cars at the moment have been very seen in our streets but today it is really a fairly scarce piece. The youngest ones surely associate the name of Ford Towns to the model This model was made in 1974, here in our country, it was Argentine motorbike. But I can assure you that this model has many years of previous life, so what I would like to do initially is a small story of the life of the Fortauno. This model was born in 1939, just started the Second World War, to replace the Foreiffel, also made by the subsidiary of Foren Alemania. This model stopped being made in 1942, 1948, obviously because of the Second World War, then 1948, when the German economy stabilized and began to need the daily mobility again, the Ford Taunus reappeared. And one of the peculiarities of this model is that after the Second World War, it was decided to call it simply Taunus, so in a single place in the car we will find that it is identified with the Ford brand, but the car was from the Taunus line and obviously belonged to the subsidiary factory of Ford. from 1952 all the taunus models change the nameplate the nameplate starts to have a number in front that represented the cylinder of the motor and a M in the back this M meant or derives from the word Germanmeisterstück or master piece because they were cars a little more evolved with better determination details than the previous taunus they were a higher level of car and that is why this nameplate This new range of Fortaunus also doubled in two sub-games, one big and one small. The small range was composed by the model 12 and 15 m, that is, with engines of 1200 and 1500 cubic centimeters, and the larger range by the model 17 m 20 m and 26 m, that is, 1700 2000 and 2600 cubic centimeters. The first three models 1200 1400 and 1700 used 4-wheel drive engines, 4-cylinder engines in line, which later were replaced by V4 engines, while the 20 and the 26, that is, the 2-liter and the 2-liter 600, during all its life, were V6 engines. All the Taunus models from 1952 to 1960 had a lot of influence on American cars, obviously, or mainly, from Ford cars. But from 1960, as this model is, they begin to have a much more European style, cars much more harmonious with designs not so strident or striking like the American cars and with more particular things than the need for the European market. However, this model, which is called the 17M P3, which is the third generation of the 17M, has a very similar trunk to some Thunderbird of the time, but obviously with smaller dimensions. This model, as we initially said, 17M was the illusion of motorization that used to be 1700 However, from this third generation, there was also a variant of engines. This model offered engines 1500, 1700 and 1800 cubic centimeters with powers that went from 60 to 70 horses. This engine is a 4-cylinder engine with head valves, uses a 32-cylinder Solix carburetor and obviously has rear traction. the wheels that the car has that are still pieces taken from American designs such as the engine is very similar to a Ford Falcon engine but obviously with two less cylinders and therefore smaller these cars also offered different variants in terms of bodywork the sedan could come with two or four doors there was a convertible version very attractive from which very few units were manufactured and there was also a rural two doors and a rural one with the rear panel sealed, which was called the Iber Ivan, which was what we could compare today with a Ford Currier or something like that, which was a utility vehicle derived from a car or a street car. A wide variety was also offered as a car equipment. As for the gearbox boxes, it could come with three or four speed to the steering wheel with interlocking seat and a sports version that I used a fourth-door box on the floor and I used two front-wheel drive boots. These cars also have a similar look to the American series cars, obviously with the Ford Falcon, which also used a very similar box and the classic inter-wheel drive that was always well American. As I told you at the beginning of the note, these cars were very seen here in the 60s, obviously the import was open so each one could bring any type of car of brands that did not exist here in the country. But the interesting thing about this model is that it does not have any adaptation for discapacitated cars, because most of these German cars that arrived in our country arrived with some adaptation for disabled people. At that time, the different banks gave credits with many benefits for people who had some mobility problem and with a certificate that was provided and was sent to Germany, the factory prepared it according to the type of problem that each person had. If it were on the legs or on the arms, right or left, these cars were specially prepared for each problem that each person had, almost in particular. So I repeat again, this car is one of the few that has not been discapacitated, so it is a normal car from the series as they were sold in Germany at that time.

Now, what happens when you remove a section of the books? A couple of the books, for example. Now Mac, I'm not sure if gravity is one of those scientific theories that you actually do believe in, but according to the rest of us sane people, what will happen with the top books is they have now what's known as potential energy. Now potential energy is mass times gravity times height. It's one of the most basic laws of physics and anybody will realize that as soon as the force holding the top The top portion of the books up, like say a couple of burning books, becomes less strong than gravity itself. The force of gravity, which is 9.8 meters per second squared, the top books will come crashing down and turn themselves into kinetic energy. This is how a pile driver works. Now what happens when this kinetic energy meets another object? Well, this depends on the structure and density of the other object. In this case, the lower object or the books on the bottom are very dense, somewhat like yourself. So, what can we predict will happen? Well, I personally predict that you're going to be too ignorant to give a shit, but as far as the books are concerned, assuming that the bottom books are actually sitting on the ground, once the top object hits the bottom object, which are both solid, the kinetic energy is going to be transferred through the bottom books, through the foundation, and down into the bottom to the ground, which would bode very strongly for your ridiculous truth or argument if only the Twin Towers had been solid. This is a structural diagram for the steel supports for the World Trade Center buildings, clearly demonstrating that they are in fact not solid. Now what happens when the kinetic energy from several floors of a building come crashing down? If you care for another example, ask any gamer who's ever played Counter Strike against 3D or my god, how many keyboards they've been through. Or maybe you've never played Jenga before. Now I'm even going to go so far as to explain to you exactly why it fell in on itself. This is my pathetic attempt at drawing a workbench. The bench has two strong outer supports and two weaker inner supports. Now I'm sure you'll be familiar with the term that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. meaning the weight of the workbench itself is being supported by a reactionary force represented by these blue arrows.

I would suspect either one of these two spots or possibly even this third spot right here in the middle. These are the laws of torque, by the way.

This is where ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" comes from.  The world celebrates Christmas for twelve hours, but it should be celebrated for twelve days because the gift of Christ is with us for twelve months of the year.      When most people hear of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" they think of the song.  This song had its origins as a teaching tool to instruct young people in the meaning and content of the Christian faith.    From 1558 to 1829 Roman Catholics in England were not able to practice their faith openly so they had to find other ways to pass on their beliefs.  This song is one way they did it.  ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" is in a sense an allegory.  Each of the items in the song represents something of religious significance.  The hidden meaning of each gift was designed to help  young Christians learn their faith.    The song goes, ""On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me...""  The ""true love"" represents God and the ""me"" who receives these presents is the Christian.","of, my, Day, Lords, gave, Ten, background, me, spiritual, Twelve, love, allegory, Christmas, color, colorful, cutters, multi, true, cookie, 10, makeover, Days, BookofMormonReader, Hanks, leaping, Dianne, to, 12, rainbow",2263,11,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/kK2IGghgH6E.mp3,"On the tenth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, Ten lords are leaping, nine ladies dancing, Maids are milking, seven swans are swimming.","On the tenth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, Ten lords are leaping, nine ladies dancing, Maids are milking, seven swans are swimming."

Aber auf der Ebene, dass sich ein ganzer Verbund noch dazu so ein Große mit 25 Gemeinden zusammen gibt und versucht eine Strategie für den Entwickler der nächsten zehn Jahre noch dazu, eine so dynamischen und natürlich auch mit konflikten belasteten Raume, wie das Zillertal zu machen, das ist schon ein tolles Beispiel.

Na verdade, o jovem à mídia, eles são uma coisa só, porque A gente vive em uma sociedade que é jovem e a gente vive em uma sociedade imediática. Então a mídia é a imagem dessa sociedade. Pode pensar em uma mídia que não seja conformada, uma mídia que não exista só para reforçar os valores que já existem na sociedade, uma mídia que resolva transformar o mundo.

A mídia não quer ser transformada, então ela vai continuar batalhando para transformar os jovens. Agora eu tenho certeza que os jovens vão conseguir transformar a mídia. Eu acho que a gente está vivendo uma atualidade, acho que acontece as duas coisas ao mesmo tempo, mas eu gostaria que o jovem transformasse muito mais a mídia.","I think that the media is capable of transforming everything. From what we think, our opinions, our ideologies, our dreams. We turn the media into more and more, we have awareness of the processes of interaction that we live, of our thoughts. In fact, the young media is just one thing, because We live in a society that is young and we live in a media society. So the media is the image of this society. You can think of a media that is not conformed, a media that does not exist just to reinforce the values that already exist in society, a media that decides to transform the world. For the simple fact that you young people are with their own equipment, migrating, it is already a own cable. young people have the opportunity to transform the media. We have to use the available communication vehicles to start modifying, to stop other things, stop what we want. Young people are already provoked by the media and that the media also provokes young people. I think the media transforms young people. Why? The young people transform the media. Because how is the media going to do something like this? I believe that in the small urban centers, the rural areas, I think that media influences the attitude of the youth. Media doesn't want to be transformed. So, it will continue to fight to transform the youth. Now I'm sure the youth will be able to transform the media. I think we are living a good life. I think these two things happen at the same time. But I would like to see the youth that the young people become much more media."

A slideshow of what we've done on our house.  Correction--we bought this house in 2011.  I misspoke in the narration.,Remodeling,56,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/kmsT-xp5uKs.mp3,"have been posting all along updates of our progress on Facebook. But we're at a point now where we're kind of halfway through a project when we've given update of where we started and how we got to where we're at. Kind of give a thumbnail sketch of what we've done to our house. This is the house we bought last summer, 2010 as a bank foreclosure. We knew we were going to have to do some work on it. When we turned the water on, we found there were some broken pipes. There were several places throughout the house that the bank hadn't winterized the house correctly. And the water got in the pipes and it froze and they broke. When we turned the water on, the water went everywhere. So the first thing we had to do was tear out sheet rock and try to find the places and pipes were broken and fix them. One of the things that we knew that we were going to do was This is where the roof leaked. We found out with the first rain we had some water coming in so we had to take temporary measures to catch the water so it didn't ruin any more. Like I said, we had mold through the house and in order to get rid of the mold we filled that dumpster, a 30 yard dumpster, we filled the sheet rock and carpet and suspended ceiling and lots of other stuff. There's a lot of tear out just to get rid of the mold. The kitchen was in place. They tore off the old wood shingles and put on asshole shingles. One of the items that Brenda wanted to address right away was to make the opening between the kitchen and living room bigger. She said, it really needed to be more open. She wanted to have an open concept floor plan. So she looked at this wall and said, that's gotta go. So there's the kitchen. The way it used to be laid out. It had an 8 foot ceiling, a soft-feet side edge and Brenda said it just wasn't laid out the way that she wanted to be able to cook in and she said we're going to change it totally. So starting with the wall we ripped off the sheet rock and found a plumbing and electrical that had to be moved and once we rerouted all of those we braced up the wall temporarily and put in a bigger header, cut it out and made a bigger opening there. Here's a picture of the kitchen as being This area off to the right was head of vaulted ceiling. It was a little eating area in large windows. We had to take these windows out because Brenda wanted the countertop to go there. And this wall was one that she wanted to break through and put a refrigerator and a pantry to take the space out of the porch to the outside. So we started tearing the ceiling out of the kitchen. And Brenda did a lot of work on the kitchen. of that work to break the sheet rock out and insulation is a very messy job. Then we removed all of the sealing joists and took those out and when we replaced them we put them back in line feet. Here's a picture of the windows that used to be and we shortened the windows up so we could put a countertop there. This is the finished view of the refrigerator and pantry to the left of the door to the door to the pantry and space in behind the refrigerator there to keep food and food items. We made the ceiling one level at nine feet before the kitchen. And there's a picture of the opening between the kitchen and the living room. And the hardwood floors got the hardwood floors installed. Kitchen cabinets just came, still in the process of getting those in. We've got them unfinished so we're going to stain some of them and paint some of them. The countertops work. We're going to build the countertops ourselves as well. So a lot of work left to do on the kitchen. Another thing that Brenda looked at was that there's this wall that you can see in the living room for the basement stairs. And it didn't go all the way over. It was just kind of a really interesting design. The stairs went down, the landing went across, 14 feet. and they went back down to the basement and there was this big open area there. This could be the extra space for the living room floor. So we decided we were going to tear it out. So Michael and Jacob came for my birthday. We started tearing out the walls, tearing out the stairs. You have to hold the sheet rock off, all the supports off. Tore down the landing, shortened it up and rearranged the stairs and extended it. The floor is extended to the living room. So we've got an extra 5 by 10 area of floor space for our living room. And of course, put hardwoods down over that and we'll have a railing over around those stairs. Another design element that Brenda wanted to change was the fireplace. She let the rock, well, do a different mantle, but she loved the stone. But the way it was designed up here, this dead space off to the left and this kind of angled wall up to the right She just said it didn't quite look right. She fought and fought and fought about what to do about it. So we took this wall and we kind of hold into it so that there's it's open to the hallway above and we framed a wall down below so that the closet has access from over behind rather than straight out into the room. And we filled it with a sheet rock to kind of balance that side of the room a little bit better on the The left hand side, the dead area up above, we framed it out and covered that with sheet rock so that the wall where the fireplace is across the front is where the littering is. There's not a lot of angles anymore. In this area to the left we're going to put the entertainment center. The master bedroom was another issue. It had soffits all around the outside edge. to have a flat ceiling and a coffered ceiling. And then the windows, the window on the left that you can see, the door opened when you opened the door. The window was down the door and the window on the right was over in the corner of the room and just not a very good design. The sub-renu said, well, we need to change that. So we tore that wall completely out and took the windows out and put in just a double window in the middle of the room. It makes it a lot to lot more inviting to be in that room. Well that's it, that's it so far Brenda is scraping ceiling texture working on that and me doing plumbing. We're doing seems like most of our spare time is doing something on our house and we still have a long ways to go but wanted to show you guys or show everybody where we started where we've been and where we are now. We'll have more updates as we get more work done.","We have been posting all along updates of our progress on Facebook.

Emitido el día 19 de enero de 2008 por Radio Carve, Montevieo, Uruguay","yamandu, roberto, robles, marichal, amaral, humberto, fernando, torres, daniel, fontana, Leonardo",621,1,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/lGSP-cV3ngs.mp3,"Leonardo y la máquina de volar de un bar toroble. La obra de Leonardo da Vinci es de una deslumbrante variedad. Es un hombre que fue pintor, escultor, arquitecto, científico, investigador, inventor, pero es prácticamente imposible encerrar en una pieza escénica esa personalidad, esa personalidad con Leonardo da Vinci desbordada de talentos. Él fue indudablemente el gran nombre del renacimiento en una época en la que los talentos florecían y se multiplicaban hasta el deslumbramiento. Juiciosamente, el mexicano Humberto Robles, quien ya había dedicado una pieza teatral a la personalidad de Frida Kahlo, que fue llenada acá también en Montevideo, esa notable pintora mexicana de vida tan complicada como trágica. Bueno, ahora Humberto Robles, sinó esta obra dedicada a Leorardo, algunos aspectos de los últimos días de la existencia de este pintor, cuando junto a uno de sus sonía todavía con la construcción de su máquina voladora. Con suma precisión, con un excelente manejo de creyendo dramático, Robles va dando vida a Leonardo en diálogos generalmente esclarecedores, resucitando también alguna anécdota a célebre para llegar así en forma más clara a la médula de un personaje de su talla. Y el esfuerzo valió la pena. Con algunas referencias casuales a su obra o a sus múltiples talentos en disciplina, disiplidna tanto artísticas como científicas. El autor permite que el espectador vaya tomando contacto con la variada personalidad de ese hombre, ese hombre impar de espíritu visionario, comprometido con la vida, comprometido con el hombre, en boca de quien punta el autor algunas reflexiones de un insolayable sentido didáctico. De esos diálogos entre el maestro y un discípulo, adornados, como decíamos, con alguna anécdota, insertado inteligentemente en el texto, y que él no le consigue plasmar en pocos trazos, por lo menos en una parte importante de esa personalidad. Pero la obra no se detiene en esa recreación, sino que impone un manejo del drama que el autor ya había manejado en su anterior Frida, dedicado a Frida Kahlo, y que extrañamente abandonó luego, quizá en aras de una comicidad primitiva, cuando poco después estrenó una comedia muy menor, acá en Montevideo, que fue El Ornito Ringo, parecía otra autor realmente. En Leonardo, Robles parece que renacer da un viraje importante en sus creaciones dramáticas. Bueno, estoy hablando de las tres que conocemos a nuestro país. Porque Leonardo vive en el escenario, se impone también teatralmente en un texto que el autor maneja con mucha habilidad para mostrar a ese hombre capaz de enfurecerse y de enternecerse, de lanzar una ironía con especial agudeza, de entusiasmarse hasta el paroxismo ante una idea avasalladora. El personaje, por supuesto, es un bocado especialmente disfrutable para un actor de la experiencia, de la sensibilidad, de la capacidad histónea que ha mostrado en su carrera Roberto Fontana. Su creación, su creación es estricta, es precisa. Sin despliegue sin necesarios, Fontana juega con los diversos matices de esa personalidad, impone el tono justo para una escena clave, contiene adecuadamente el dramatismo de otra escena, pero no hay más allá de los límites justos. maneja una voz especialmente dotada para lanzar de pronto como una flecha alguna pequeña ironía o para adecuar sus tonos a alguna situación especialmente poética que también las tiene la obra su actuación domina por supuesto todo el espectáculo y el director Daniel Torres confía acertadamente su impacto a esa creación protagonica cuidando además el clima envolvente de cada situación para que la figura de Leonardo os derrote Roberto Fontana mantenga su centro de atención o de interés. La dirección no solamente de Daniel Torres sino también de Humberto Robles, quien no pudo quedarse para el estreno y en este momento está el México, pero estuvo también el principio de la apuesta en escena que culminó luego Daniel Torres. Y acompañando esa actuación polarizante de Roberto Fontana, el joven Fernando Amaral acierta también en la definición de ese alumno, ese alumno fiel, atento, deslumbrado, y de la Teatro Circular. Leonardo y la máquina de volar escribió un Berto Robles, codirició con Daniel Torres y lo hacen en realmente muy bien Roberto Fontana y Fernando Amaral.","Leonardo and the flying machine of Umberto Robles. The work of Leonardo da Vinci is of a deluminating variety. He was a painter, sculptor, architect, scientist, researcher, inventor. It is practically impossible to close that personality in a scenic piece with Leonardo da Vinci, a talented person. He was undoubtedly the great name of the Renaissance, in a time when The talents flourished and multiplied to enlightenment. The Mexican Humberto Robles, who had already dedicated a theatrical piece to the personality of Frida Kahlo, who was also here in Montevideo, that notable Mexican painter of life as complicated as a tragic. Now Humberto Robles signed this work dedicated to Leorardo, some aspects of the last days of the existence of this painter, when together with one of his disciples and the same story of the first film, which was about the construction of his flying machine. With great precision, excellent control of the dramatic crescendo, Robles was giving life to Leonardo in dialogue with generally clear-cutters, also resuscitating some silver anaconda to get to a clearer form of the medium of a character in his size. And the effort was worth it. With some casual references to his work, or to his multiple talents in disciplines, and disciplines both artistic and scientific. The author allows the viewer to take contact with the varied personality of that man, that man in part, visionary spirit, committed to life, committed to man, in the mouth of the author, some reflections of a legible insolent sense of life. Of those dialogues between a master and a disciple, adorned, as we said, with some anecdotal, inserted intelligently in the text, and he manages to plasm in a few steps at least an important part of that personality. But the work does not stop in that recreation, but it imposes a management of the drama that the author had already managed in his previous Frida, dedicated to Frida Kahlo, and that he strangely abandoned later, perhaps in the era of a primitive comedy, when shortly after he released a very minor comedy, Cal Monte Viedeo, which was the Ornito Ringo, it really seemed another author. Here, in Leonardo, Robles seemed to be reborn. He gave an important turn in his dramatic creations. I'm talking about the three that we know of our country. Because Leonardo lives in the stage. He also imposes, in a text that the author handles with great skill, to show that man able to infuriate and enter, to throw a irony with a special glee, of enthusiasm, to the paroxysm, before an abasal idea. He is a vocation especially enjoyable for an actor of experience, of sensitivity, of the capacity of the script and who has been in his career, Roberto Fontana. His creation, his creation is strict, it is precise. Without explanations, without necessaries, Fontana plays with the various nuances of that personality, imposes the right tone for a key scene, he adequately contains the dramatism of another scene, but no further than the right limits. He especially uses a voice to launch a small irony or to adjust his tones to a poetic situation that also has the work. His performance dominates, of course, all of this from a show. And the director, Daniel Torres, firmly believes in his impact on that main creation, also taking care of the environment of each situation so that the figure of Leonardo, Roberto Fontana maintains his center of attention or interest. Well, the direction is not only Daniel Torres, but also Umberto Robles who could not stay for the premiere and at this moment it is the Mexico, but it was also at the beginning of the staging that Daniel Torres later culminated. And accompanying that polarizing performance of Roberto Fontana, young Fernando Amaral also asserts in the definition of that student, that student faithful, attentive, disjointed, and always be with the master's dreams. It's not easy to act in front of an actor of the force of Roberto Fontana, but both understand each other wonderfully in the stage. In a final scene, I think it's an idea by the author in which the student lies piously to the master, he achieves precisely the poetic impact, surely sought by Humberto Robles. The result is thus widely enjoyable and this can be seen in the voice of the master. Leonardo and the flying machine, who wrote a Roberto Robles, co-directed with Daniel Torres and they really do it very well Roberto Fontana and Fernando Amaral"

Great, I got three or four things for you. You want me to just go shoot them out or you want to ask questions? Just like to ask a few questions. Go ahead. Alright, first I want to talk about West Webster. Yes. The 501C3 code limiting the availability. Yes, well look. Can you comment on that? Yeah, the people in the Rochester area were extremely generous after the horrible fire and shootings in West Webster and over $900,000 was collected by the West Webster Fire Department to go to the families who had lost loved ones or had loved ones injured. Unfortunately, they started collecting the money before they filed for a 501C3 tax exemption. And unless we change the law for particularly just for West Webster, the, let me say that again, unfortunately, West Webster Fire Department started collecting the money before they applied for the 501C3. And by one of these little catchalls in the law, that money money would not be tax exempt. The donees would not get tax exemption if you donated money to West Webster, and the families who get the money, that money wouldn't be tax free. So we want to pass legislation, Congresswoman Slaughter and I do, to just make sure that this specific West Webster fire department charity raising is tax exempt. It's been done before for the victims of 9-11 for a couple of fires out west where the same thing happened. we can get this law passed because the generosity of people in the Rochester area was overwhelming. That money should get the same tax exemption as any other charity gets just because they applied a little too late shouldn't stand in the way. Right. Two more quick things. Right. Obviously the big news today and yesterday is Verizon. Yes. The government phone records. Today the House intel chairman said a domestic terror attack had been thwarted because of the phone records collection but that hasn't stopped a lot of criticism of the collecting, where do you stand on that? Well, I think we have to look into this really carefully. We always have a balance in America, protecting us from danger and terrorism, particularly since 9-11, but at the same time maintaining our freedom and our privacy. And so while the law does allow the federal government in court supervised instances to look at the phone records of somebody they suspect, the question is why were there so many? What kind of of checks and balances were in place and was the privacy of the people protected. And so I have a lot of those questions. I'm asking them of the agency that did all this snooping. And I want to make sure that when they do it, it's only needed. And we don't go undergo these kinds of fishing expeditions that might violate people's privacy. And I just wanted to touch on sunscreen finally. Yes. Last week the FDA, new labeling rules and then this week we're talking about the FDA use that are out earlier today. Well, let me just say this. In Canada, in Europe, in Asia, they've been using a sunscreen that's much more effective than the ones that are allowed to be sold in the United States. There are two kinds of ultraviolet rays that hurt us and the sunscreens used in other countries block both kinds of ultraviolet rays. The one allowed to be sold here in America only blocks one kind of the ultraviolet rays. And so the FDA has had many different companies apply to use the stronger, more effective sunscreen and to sell it here in the United States. The FDA has had the case for 10 years and hasn't given an answer. So we're saying give us an answer. If it's not safe, you think it's not safe, let us know. Otherwise, let this sunscreen be sold on the market. It'll save thousands of lives. In the Rochester Finger Lakes area alone, there are over 200 cases of melanoma, deadly serious skin cancer caused by the sun in last year. And so we have to get the best sunscreen available. The FDA can't sit on these cases for such a long period of time. And the sunscreen, the more effective sunscreen used in Europe, Asia, Canada has had no bad side effects. Why can't it be sold here?

Eu costumo dizer o seguinte, que caráter não é algo que sofre concessões. Hoje eu vou ser uma pessoa de bom caráter e amanhã eu acredito que vou ter algumas transgressões permitidas na minha índole, na minha conduta. Não é bem assim, né? Ou você é ou não é? Gente boa, gente boa. Quem não é gente boa, tá fora. E esse pai ajudou dessa forma. dele com um saquinho esquisito. O pai ficou só de canto dando aquela cuidada. Ele falou que que é isso aí rapaz. Ele não, rapaz. Isso aqui é um negócio que eu vou esconder aqui no sofá, mas não é nada não, eu só não preciso se preocupar. E ele colocou o negócio no sofá. O pai não teve dúvida. Chamou a polícia, falou, se for droga, se for burundanga eu não quero esse negócio na minha casa. Ah, mas meu filho vai preso? Que vá, porque eu não admito coisa errada debaixo do meu teto. Tá de parabéns esse homem. Quem vai contar pra gente essa história eu repórter feio na Nogacia. então eu encontrei a droga de bar do sofá. Elias estava fora de casa no final de semana. Hoje, assim que o filho chegou, aparentemente sobre efeito de álcool, seu João criou coragem e ligou para a polícia, dentro da localização exata de onde estava o Caim. Eu já tinha uma medo, desconfia, mas eu desconfiei mais na sexta-feira por causa do movimento e eu estava usando a sacola que eu nunca tinha visto. Apareceu com essa sacola diferente, então aí eu fui vestigar ele, então eu achei Ele pegou em curto o sofá e colocou a droga na sua sofa. Aqui no plantão policial, Elias Rodríguez da Mar Sena disse que apenas estava guardando o entorno presente, mas não teve jeito. Ele foi indiciado por tráfico de drogas e, se incongerado, poderá pegar de cinco a 15 anos de prisão. Ele informou a nossa equipe que a droga era dele, pegou de um traficante maior, estava guardando por 500 reais essa droga. Esse tipo de ocorrência é muito comum, ainda mais vindo de um pai, né? Que sempre o pai quer proteger. Mas o pai, dentro da lei, querendo que o filho seja um bom sofrador, o cidadão fez a parte dele. cara o guatambuí não tem medo não e aí o filho chega não pegou para guardar o negócio assim porque entra os contos olha o enguíos que ele poderia arrumar para o pai e se a polícia estivesse investigando né esse traficante e desce uma batida nessa casa e o pai preso também até ele explicar que essa coisa não era dele ele ia passar um bom tempo na grade na jaula que a gente simples não tem tanto dinheiro para ficar pagando advogado que fica atrás da grade nesse país infelizmente só quem não tem dinheiro para dar na mão de advogado, que se tiver vai solto rapidinho. Esse homem, se a polícia desce uma batida ele é bacana, melhor o filho dele, melhor ele sofreu sabendo que o filho está preso, porque fez coisa errada, do que ele ter que pagar por algo que não cometeu. E a gente continua acompanhando essa história, que com certeza vai ter desdobramento, tem gente aí criticando, onde já se viu um pai, ele poderia muito bem ter botado o filho para correr. É filho, pode ser o que for, sobrinho, primo, parente, está fazendo coisa errada, você vai admitir, você vai passar a mãozinha, permitir que isso aconteça, inclusive, debaixo do teu teto. Você vai pacando junto.","The father decided to report the son to the police in Marília. I usually say that character is not something that suffers from concessions. Today I will be a good character and tomorrow I believe I will have some transgressions allowed in my indole, in my conduct. It's not like that. You are or you are not. Good people, good people. Who is not good people, is out. And this father helped this way. The son came home. with a weird bag. The bag, the father, was just singing, taking care of it. He said, what is this, boy? He said, no, this is the thing I'm going to hide here on the couch, but it's nothing, I just don't need to worry. And he put the thing on the couch. The father had no doubt. He called the police, said, if it was drugs, if it was burundanga, I don't want this thing in my house. But my son is arrested. What is it? Because I don't admit anything wrong under my roof. Congratulations to this man. Who will tell us this story, I report to the Fenerbahçe. This guy that appears in the picture, it's Elias Rodrigues da Marcena. He was arrested for drug trafficking. In his house, the police found a kilo of cocaine. What catches your attention is who made the report. It was his father. His father, João, took the child's hand and decided to follow Elias. It was when he found the bag full of drugs under the sofa. I found it because of the movement I saw and it was a little different. So I took it and went to investigate it. I found the drug on the couch. Elias was out of the house on the weekend. Today, as soon as the son arrived, apparently under alcohol, his wife created courage and called the police. In the exact location, where he was, he fell. I was already afraid, I was distrustful, but I distrust more on Friday because of the movement. And I was using the bag I had never seen before. It appeared with this different bag. So I went to investigate it. He caught the driver and put the drug on the driver. Here in the police station, Elias Rodríguez da Marcena said that he was just keeping the drug. But there was no way. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison for drug trafficking. He informed our team that the drug was his. He took a bigger drug dealer and is keeping this drug for R$ 500. This kind of occurrence is very common. It's more like a father who always wants to protect. But the father, in the law, wanting the son to be a good son, and the citizen did his part. The guy, the guatambu, is not afraid. And then the son arrives, took to keep the thing like that, because he has a hundred points. Look at the inquiries that he could arrange for the father. And if the police were investigating this trafficker and gave him a beating in this house, and the father caught too, until he explained that this thing was not his, he would spend a good time in the classroom, in the classroom, which is simple people, there is not so much money to pay for the lawyer, who stays behind the grade in this country, unfortunately, only those who don't have money to give in the hands of the lawyer. Because if he had, he would be released quickly. This man, if the police give him a beating, he would be nice. Better his son, better he suffered knowing that the son was arrested because he did something wrong than he had to pay for something he didn't commit. And we keep following this story that will certainly have a double, there are people criticizing, where you saw a father, he could have put the son to run. It's son, it can be what it was, cousin, cousin, doing the wrong thing, you will admit it, you will pass the hand, allow it to happen even below your ceiling, you will go to the corner together."

Because this song made me not know Cai Jian Yang. Before I decided to choose this song, I hesitated for a long time. Because this song has many interesting parts. Especially on the skill level, or on the love level. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! For me, this time is a new breakthrough, and also a new challenge. Then, Ginny will miss you I think you are singing at the beginning of the song. I'm looking forward to it. But when you start singing at the beginning of the song, you are completely immersed in your shortcomings. Including your long and hard-to-understand voice, your voice and your voice are completely strange in the rhythm. I think you are not good enough for the practice of this song. You have to work harder. Thank you. Jinny, it's not good to sing and sing. At first, it was hard to sing. The low part of the low part can't be lowered. The low part is not good. And then when you reach the high notes, it's so scary. The more you walk, the better. But I dare to say that your voice is quite good. It's good to choose the right song. If you see the next time I hope you can practice your low notes and high notes. Don't be nervous. The song that just sang reminds me of a person who just left us. He is the one who didn't have anyone to look forward to. What are you doing? I'm learning how to do a model. How is that possible? Why? Your height is not tall, your eyes are not sharp. How is that possible? We are all together, so we are together in the end. We can't be supermodels, but we can sing it out. Yes, we can sing it out. Supermodels are so smart. Then let's sing out the confidence and power of supermodels. We are all so cute."

I'm in the small town of Wozyska Górna in Poland's southern Silesia, the country's biggest coal mining region. No other EU member state is as dependent on coal as Poland. Over 90% of its energy comes from coal-fired power stations. Minor Olek Lesniewski takes me on a tour of his workplace. the pit and show me the machines he uses. Oleg is brimming with enthusiasm about his job. When the lift reaches the bottom, we clamber into an underground train. Back in Germany, I use sustainable energy. To me, the idea of coal mining is anything but modern. In fact, this journey underground feels like one back in time. Our train rattles along at 12 kilometers per hour. Oleg tells me he's worked here for 27 years, since This is my first time underground. On route to the pit, I begin to feel pretty claustrophobic. It's humid, narrow, and I can taste the coal in the air. And it takes us an hour and a half to reach our destination. The further we go, the darker it gets. I have no idea which direction we're headed anymore. I couldn't imagine having to work here day in, day out. I can tell when we've reached chaffed 561 by the time we've reached the chaff. the sheer noise. And there it is, the raw material. Oleg heads the team here. He has to keep an eye on all the miners and check that all the machines work. His father was a miner too. He tells me about the first time he came down a mine when he was still in school. I couldn't believe there were no windows, he says. But he acclimatized pretty quickly. A lot of the mining is done mechanically. But now and again I see miners working by hand. Working conditions are top I've never allowed myself to get scared, or like says. Most of the people that work here grew up around mining. It's very formative. And financially speaking, they don't fare too badly. The pay isn't brilliant. An average miner's not going to be able to do that. But after 25 years of work, they've already earned themselves a solid pension, which acts as a big incentive. Many families in the region couldn't imagine a life without mining. Oleg's colleague, Arek, tells me he hopes his son will one day work here too. When he's done with school, Arek says he's going to study engineering, and soon he'll be stepping into my shoes. Experts say coal is so plentiful in Poland that the poles could carry a lot of energy. This miner's convinced that coal will never run out in Silesia. It's down to the geological makeup of a place, he says. Some places have coal, others don't. You have to look for it, but it's always there somewhere. But Poland's hanging on to it. Coal is easy to get hold of domestically, so the population doesn't have to be dependent on foreign imports like, say, Russian gas. After five hours of darkness, I finally get a glimpse of data. A look at Huazizca Gourna from above reveals that the mine is quite literally at the center of the town. And the coal burning power station is just a stone's throw away, where half of the excavated coal is taken for burning. Locals are all invested in the mining industry somehow. Mining shapes both economic and social life here. I meet Olex's brother, Mira Suave, who shows me where the coal's taken once it's above ground. Six and a half thousand people He explains that this is where the coal comes out of the shaft. And it's only any good to us once it's here, he says. The mine was due for closure seven years ago because the state lacked the funding for new investment. But the miners took to the streets in protest and wrote to the then Pope John Paul II. The mine was kept open. Here in Poland, they say that the mining lobby is so big that no government would ever dare interfere. Miro Swamph is already in retirement and runs an in-house mining museum. He wants to preserve the history of the mines and encourage younger generations to keep on mining. These days, women are allowed to work in the mines too, in theory at least, as yet none have ever opted to do so. Miroslav's father, Frantziszek, is 88 years old. He was a minor too, and over the years he's collected all sorts of mining memorabilia. I asked the men about the effect of coal mining on the climate. They're well aware of the debate that's raging in the EU. Maybe there is such a thing as global warming, says Miroslav. We're no specialists in that field, but energy supply in Poland hinges on coal. At the moment, we have no alternative. Plans are a foot for a nuclear power plant, but it's a controversial issue in Poland. And the development of renewable energy technology seems to be slow off the ground. So the mine looks set to stay for the foreseeable future. Miroslav Olek and his father invite me to visit them at home. Miroslav shows me old maps and pictures of the mine. He says that life in his hometown would be unimaginable without coal mining. The local economy would have ground to a halt, he says. One thousand six hundred people work in the mine, he explains. And often whole families depend on their wages, with the help of the Without the mines, 10,000 people would be out of work. And finding alternative works nearly impossible. There isn't any. But the industry may soon become a burden on the country as a whole. The EU is demanding that Poland pay a hefty levy if it doesn't reduce its carbon emission levels. I really hope that we can strike a deal with the EU, says Mero Swamp, and that we don't have to pay too much for our CO2 emissions. Surely no one can demand that we stop mining just like that from one day to the next. Oleg adds that the union must surely understand. Later, Miroslav takes me back to the mine, just in time for the shift change. The mine is always a buzz with activity. With 120,000 people across Poland employed in the coal mining industry, many couldn't of living without it.","I'm getting ready to go 530 meters underground.

Zunyptons here and I'm bringing you guys about the gameplay slash commentary and as you can see I'm doing the P90 I have a gold I'm doing a TDM This will be my second episode for my weapons series for some machine guns So let's get started. So it's locked at level 38. So kind of halfway there It's not gonna be too long to unlock it. You can get some pretty good experience out of it magazine rounds 50 rounds. That's a lot around Zedkita I think it's the the world besides light machine guns. I think it's the highest out of assault rifles and sniper rifles and the saw rifles It has the best capacity of rounds and speed point two seconds just like I think all are most of the submachine guns. Yes Reload speed 2.76 So I thought that was really nice because as you can see from yesterday when I did the empty seven the empty seven was 3 seconds and this is just a little bit lower, but it's also really good because it has more mags and more rounds I bet more rounds and a faster reload speed so that was really nice Yeah, so the P90 as you can see right here in the gameplay the perks I'm using is scavenger pro hardline pro and Stadia and pro so it's the same perks as yesterday I think it's great for the submachine guns. I personally don't think you need to have scavenger pro if you have extended mags or you don't need extended mags if you have scavenger. Scavenger pro is the extra mags. If you don't have one you don't need to have the other but I like to have it. I just feel like that way. Other than you can have a silencer which is nice. Really nice. I use that a lot. it because it ruins the range and everything which is not really that much bad but to me I'd rather have extended mags so I can shoot a lot more and just spam the hell out of them but yes so the recoil is fine at least that's what I think it's pretty steady I would say it's kind of like the MP7 but I think the MP7's recoil is a little bit better The recoil kind of moves like side to side more than up up or down So it's really nice to maintain under than like the PM9 or has crazy crazy recoil so Yes, and so the P90 has the second worst fire rate under the 1p45 And that's why I make it up for it as putting rapid fire on it so I can kill them fast and get bullets out faster. I'm using my G18 and kitballs, I think that's great for close range, great secondary, at least that's what I think so you can use any machine pistol. that it could be good in some situations if they have a lot of equipment like um so if you want to rush and there's a claymore around the corner you could uh get that out of there but uh stocker pro probably does the same thing or there's um but an ims around the corner it's going to ruin your rushing and stuff like that then you take it out quickly and syra pros a good idea for that and um yeah if that's it Not a great beautiful score, but I'm at the top of the leaderboards after I like to be Smarble you doing the UMP 45. I have a great great TDM scores probably my best Actually my second best TDM I really get TDM after that Yeah, my name is your Nick Tomerson. I'll see you guys later I know I'm gonna be famous cuz my friends and family and sister Been on the low concern That's Andre three stacks. I do it big take no relax.

The area of ​​the building is wide, so many types of area can be seen. I thought it was a bit boring, but if I get in, I can see the possibilities. And you can see that it's not just a coincidence, it's not boring at all. Since February 2011, I was the only one in the family and family. In the end, I could not get into serious problems, as I was a member of the family. I was in Brussels since September 2011. It was very exciting to be able to be in the UN Secretary of State in the United States. I was able to be part of the UN's national team. I was in the 21st EU member group. I feel a great opportunity to learn about the whole of Hungary, the whole of the foreign countries. I have a lot of experience, which I got from my colleagues in the Netherlands. I love it, it's the most important experience of my life. I can't be anywhere else in the European Union, for sure. I was there in England, but France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Romania, Austria. I know that you're going to Germany. I am now a member of the Association of Social Sciences. I am a part of the protocol and project manager assistance group.

Hän jo verittää tohon päälle tussilla, että mä en vaikuttaisi ihan niin köyhältä. Yep, siinä on kantamukset ja tolla pitäisi hyöketä 7 kilos aam. Tonne suuntaan eli hyvin käy rautatiaasemalle. Ei kannata ajan kovin lujaa muuten kuoleen hikisyyten. Alright, ei muuta ku katotaan perille. Jaa, as, kameran visiirinäköjään. Ajosta ei jotain. Onneksi olen niin koko kunnossa, että ei paljon tunnu missään tämä polkeminen vastatuulee. Ja jos jonkun hirveän rinkankaa silleen ja yrittää, tämä matkalveliraportti mun pitää ruveta riksuumenevästi unassa kikkaa ja lähtee aloittamaan hirveästä. Visirinkankaan on hirveästä. Se ei nimittäin menee kiinni. Kello on nyt jonkun verran pääsin asemalle normaalisti. No nyt katotaan sitten jos venataan 20 minuuttia. Se jää käy se varmaan tuolla lahden. Tai lahden suuntaan raita 8 riksuun päin. Nyt ollaan tultu jonkin lahteen. En tiedä mikä katotaan. Ei kätä teidän käänn tarvitse tietää. Mutta täällä on jotain tällä sijoittui. Mutta on kaikenlaisia tuolla siihen. En tiedä oikeesti. Ohi täällä on hei. Driftool! Olisi ihan huolunut. Eli nyt pitää mennä suihkuja vaihtaa vaatteita pistää laajaa saavkaa. Ja jälkeen katotaan uudestaan. Kun on hikikomeroitsija tarvitsee aina vähän maistia, että uskaltoutuu ulos kodista. Mä otan tällaisen silhyn klippeen, mitkä on tosi kiva lätkis, sit kasaan jälkiketeen. Tulee pahen jotain turhanpäivästä sinne YouTubein. No niin, nyt koska kaksi tyyppiä mun rinnalla haluaa seilyttää anonymiteltiin, se nii katotaan tonne päin siellä on tälleen. Ja jos kenelikkejä ei pääselväksi, niin nyt ollaan tälleen lahde. Ja sitten poikettiin yhdelle ja näihin tunnelmiin varmaan tuota on sopiva lopettaa. Tää liittyy desukoniin varmasti jollain tavalla. Luulen, että olemme soikeeseen suuntaan. Kyllä. No niin, nyt on tälläen desukon. Nyt mennään tuonne sisällä. Ja mä en tiedä, että uskalakkaan kuvaata siellä, mitä pakko yrittää. Löytyy tällainen metsäpolku. Ja tota, mennään varmaan tänne juomaan siideräitä desukoniin. Ja ei onnettä kauastaakse. Mutta tota en tiedä. Mihin päädytään? Koska täällä ei oikeasti tiedä, missä on. Koska tuolla on desukanien äletupää menetä anonymiteettisä. Jos tähdetään tänne näin. Tää on aika tämmöinen jyrkkä polku. Me lähdetään tuonne. Tästä on aika pahaa pätkä kyllä YouTube-in, kun me vähän niin kuin eksyttiin alkuperäisesti. Tottaisiin täällä, mitä asujaimistoo. Tässä olisi ihan saatana hyvä setti. Kato. Ei, kun sarin nyt mä kirailin YouTube-in. Miksi taas aika kova? Kulis vain ne pidettämme. Ei. Okei. ja olen nyt halua kaikkeen nimien paljasta, että tässä näin, mutta on ollut kyllä tosi kivoja tyyppejä. Yllätyin ihan positiivisesti. Kaikki oli hullun mukavia tälläinen. Me olen tultu tälläiseen aika pitkälle ylös. Me tultiin tuosta S-marketin kulmalta ohi desukanin ja en vielä tiedä, mitä siellä desukanis pitäisi olla. Viittä vai oli viittä? Mitä mieltä sä oot kuvalaudesta? Oisko sulla mitään sanottavaa tästä aiheesta? No, mä en ite omista tietokoneetta. Täkin mä oon saanut käyttää sitä, mä oon saanut mennä hetiä kaikille täällä. Sä oottelleen internet-tietoviissa se, joo. Mutta tota... mä haluan tutustua kuvalautaan pikemminkin sen jäsenten kautta, kuin pelkästään. Niin, noin määrän. Sillee nähdä sen, sillee roidin olaan takaa. Joo, en mäkään siis kuvalautaa mulle semmoneen juttu, että tota... Miten kerääntyy aika paljon masentuneita ihmisiä, minkälainen mäkin on jollain asteella itsekin? Sitä mä oon täs miettinyt, että sellasi ihmisiin... No siis jos itsellä menee hyvin, niin voi olla vaikea samaistuun toisten ahdinkoon mun mielestä. Mielestäni on hyvä nähdä niit tyyppejä. Niin, no ei näe nyt kertaa. Ei, johon kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa, kertaa Se on sääntäkin tavalla, että pitää kuminkin keskustella vähän netissä kanssa. No ei oo mitään noin. Mä taritän osaistua sinne nettikeskusteluun maasioon paljon, ja sitten kun saan oman tietokoneen. Joo, mutta ei siellä netissä käydään läpi aika synkkiaiheita niin kuin jotain tälle. Ja siis loppupeleissä jos löytää jotain tyyppejä, jotka on vähänkään samalla altopituudella. Niin, no se täält voi löytää. Täält voi löytää kun on just semmosia taiteellisempiä. Oho. Ei se mitään. Mutta siis tosiaan niin täält voi just tyytää vähän semmosia taiteellisempiä. Mulla ei ole ihan sama, että minkälaisia luonteita mä näen. Oikein noit tyyppejä ei pääse miksi miittaa, mutta en ole oikein uskalla lyötäytyy kenenkään porukkaa. Kun kaikilla on omat kuviot, niin ei viitti silleen mennä. Ilta vasta nuori, kyllä lämpeneen sit. En mä tiedä, siis tosiaan pitäisi käydä varmaan jossain paikallisessa ja ehkä vähän laulaa karaukeen. Kohta sen nimi homojen miitti ja sen jälkeen katsotaan mitä tapahtuu. Niin, täytyy tukemaa karaukeen. Sehän onko muunkin riehaantumaa siellä laulamista? Ja nyt ollaan nimi-humojen miitissä ja osan ota näette siitä. Me voimme vielä kontriputtaa yhden jalan. Okei, eli nyt kävelemme täällä jostain lahden keskustassa Apautralla ja tässä on kaikenlaisia donitsimeininkin ja sellaisia onnistuneen varsin onnistuneen nimi-humomiitin jälkeen palataan tuota meidän tukikohtaan ja katsotaan siitä miten ilta lähtee kehittymään jos lainkaan","This is still a long way to go. I'm already trying to get to the top of the hill so I don't have to be so scared. There are the slopes and there I have to climb 7 km. There is the direction, so I have to be careful. I can't drive a cow or something, I'm dying. Alright, let's see what happens. And the camera is in the water. I'm driving. Luckily I'm so tired that I don't feel much wind in the wind. I'm trying to do some kind of a lot of running. This is a road report. I have to go to the river to get some water. That's what we call it. I just got to the top of the hill. Now we will see if we can get there in 20 minutes. And then we will go to the Lahden. Or Lahden is heading for Rijksuunpäin. Now we are at the Lahden. I don't know what you guys need to know. But there is something here. But there are all kinds of things here. Oh, here it is. Drift! That would be crazy. Now we have to go to the toilet and put the towel. Now I found this, I don't know if you know this legendary I wanted to know this background information Can you tell me your anonymity? I don't have a picture of your name Where do you tell me? What are these words? Do you see what's going on? I don't know, this must be some kind of a domino or something Twist, leak, dunk, then we have dunk, slam dunk Yep, there's some kind of a rope I always need to taste the Hikikomeros, because I think it's going to be a good place to eat. I'll take these little clips, which are really nice to take with me. But I'll be back with something funny on YouTube. Dezuconi is probably connected to the road. I think we are in the right direction. Now we are in Dezuconi. I will go inside and film what the pack is trying to do. We found a forest pole. We will probably go to drink some of the Dezuconi and some of the Dezuconi. Why is it so hard? I would rather stay here. No. Okay. So now we are at the bottom of the lake. I just realized that I'm giving myself a little wine drink picture when I drink the whole thing. I drink the second alcohol level and I wanted to fix my hands a bit. It's just a small, low level thing that's not so bad for social people. And now we are, in fact, meeting a few people I don't want to name all of them but I'm happy with the result. I'm surprised that all of them were great. We've come to this place for a long time. We came from the S-market corner to the Dezucon. I don't know what Dezucon should be like. You have to use the boat to get to the river and then you can get to the lake and then we'll see. Oh, the boat is on the name tag. How many kilometers? About 5. I think it's about an hour. We're going to the lake for a while. We'll find a place to stay and think about the conditions. This is my brood and we'll talk about it. What do you think about filming? I don't own a computer I can use it I can go to the internet and use it I want to get to know the film more through the settings than by watching it Yes, I understand I want to see it when I'm back in the studio I don't think filming is a thing for me I would just believe in talking, because it's always difficult. I don't really know what kind of nature I'm seeing. Well, it's always a risk to have a perspective and a thing that you can say in a more concrete way than in a video. I have no idea what I'm thinking about here. I have that in mind here with me. It's good that you're a person. Otherwise they wouldn't have come here alone. Because those guys can't really do anything, but they're not really happy with the group. When everyone has their own pictures, they don't go there. I don't know, so I think you should go somewhere and maybe sing karaoke. And then we'll see what happens. Maybe you can sing to someone else? Okay, so we're going to the middle of the lake to get some water. Here are all kinds of Donetsk and the famous, especially famous, name-homomythian after that we'll go to our camp and see how the evening goes."

Благодаря компьютерной мультипликации мы можем проникнуть в клетку и увидеть, как работает эта замечательная система. Проникнув в центр клетки мы видим плотно скрученные нити ДНК, хранилища информации необходимой для построения любого белка в живом организме. В процессе известном как транскрипция, молекулярный механизм вначале развертывает какую-то секцию спирали ДНК, чтобы выявить генетическую информацию необходимую для создания данной конкретной молекулы белка. Затем другой механизм копирует эту информацию, чтобы создать специфическую молекулу известную как информационная Рибонуплеиновая кислота или краткая РНК. По завершении процесса транскрипции, тонкая полоска РНК проносит генетическую информацию сквозь комплекс, спор ядра, своеобразный механизм работающий как привратник, регулирующий вход и выход из ядра клетки. Лента молекулы РНК направляется на своеобразную фабрику молекул, которая называется Рибосомой. Она состоит из двух частей. Первая надежно прикрепляет РНК к Рибосоме, а затем вторая начинает сам процесс сочетания аминокислот в белки. Именно на этой сборочной линии Рибосомой создается та самая специфический упорядочная цепочка из аминокислот. которые доставляются на фабрику ребосому из других частей клетки. Собраны из 10 цепочки аминокислот зачастую состоят из сотен отдельных элементов. Именно их последовательность и определяет индивидуальный тип вырабатываемого убилка. По завершению создания новой белковой цепочки она поступает из ребосомы в другое цилиндрической формы клеточный механизм, где ей придается специфическая структурная конфигурация. Она также необходима для успешного функционирования только что построена убилка. После того, как цепочка свернулась в белок, он высвобождается и с помощью уже другого молекулярного механизма переносится именно в то месток летки, где он необходим. Это просто замечательное явление. Такой прекрасно настроенный и в то же время такой миниатюрный механизм. Это ли неподтверждение того, что у него есть разумный проектировщик и создатель? Мы изучили все детали немоверно сложного и реально существующего молекулярного комплекса обработки. генетической информации.

Thanks to computer multiplication, we can penetrate the cage and see how this wonderful system works. By penetrating the cage center, we see tightly twisted DNA threads, keeping the information necessary to build any protein in the living body. In the process known as transcription, molecular mechanism at first develops some section of the DNA spiral to find out the genetic information required to create this particular molecule protein. Then another mechanism copies this information to create a specific molecule known as information ribonuclein acid or short RNA. After the process of transcription, thin strip of RNA carries genetic information through a complex The core of the core is a mechanism that works as a regulator, which regulates the input and output of the core of the cage. The RNK-lentomolecules is directed to the fiber-based molecule, which is called ribosom. It consists of two parts. The first one is securely attached to the ribosom, and the second one begins the process of mixing amino acid into protein. which are delivered to the factory of ribosomes from other parts of the cage. The chains collected here are often made of hundreds of separate elements. Their sequence determines the individual type of the modified protein. At the end of the creation of the new protein chain, it comes from ribosomes into a different cylindrical form of the cage mechanism, where it is given a specific structural configuration. It is also necessary for successful functioning of only the built-in protein. After the chain is turned into a protein, it is released and transferred to the place where it is needed. of genetic information. This is the new molecular genetics area where we find the most convincing evidence of the reasonable idea of the Earth's system."

En 1905 días tú podrás cambiar todo eso o podrás lograr tu meta y ahorita les voy a explicar por qué, mire, para principiantes. Si tú eres una persona que estás tratando de bajar de y pesas mucho y quieres correr una carrera o un maratón en 1905 días tú lo vas a poder lograr ahora ahorita voy a explicar los entrenamientos ahora la persona intermedia los intermedios las personas que ya están corriendo mis amiguitos que ya han estado empezando a correr maratones pero quieren lograr un maratón de usted hablando de los 26.2 millas andele ahora si vamos a hablar de algo bien específico que aseguro que en situ entrenas como yo voy a estar hablando ahorita en mil 95 días tu vas a lograr un buen tiempo si tu tiempo de 4 horas para ese día va a ser dos y tanto yo no sé dos y un cuarenta dos cuarenta pero de que lo vas a lograr o sea de que lo vas a lograr superar todo ese tiempo lo vas a lograr ahora si eres un avanzado te garantizo que tu lo vas a no solamente lo vas a lograr sino que puede que tu seas el que gane es el maratón ahora por qué les digo esto bueno he platicado con entrenadores y corredores de queña estiopias todos los corredores que realmente siempre ganan los maratones y hay una clave entre este tipo de entrenamiento ahora si tú entrenas para principiantes si tú entrenas el primer mes la dieta la tonificación y ejercicio aeróbico si recuerde a todos los videos están ahí en mi canal les puede verlo en el primer año entrenan por lo menos los 11 meses bien duro 5 días a la semana o 6 días a la semana guardando su dieta tratando de hacer lo que más cuerdas y luego los 11 meses entrenan su dieta y luego un mes ya sea el mes de enero o el último mes como ustedes como ustedes se sientan mejor los descansan sin hacer nada y luego vuelven a empezar a entrenar otra vez al siguiente año otra vez bajándola a dienta tonificando y el tercer año ahora sí como ya bajaste como ya tonificaste como ya tienes ahora si eres principiante principiante te aseguro que por lo menos cuando vayas al maratón no vas a tener mucho dolor como cuando se tiene cuando no entrenas por eso lo estoy diciendo mil 95 días es muy importante ahora el primer año un mes el segundo año otra vez descansé un mes y el tercer año por lo menos descansé un mes pero en intermedio o sea después de los seis meses que han estado entrenando otra vez con su meta que han estado haciendo o me descansa y luego de ahí siguen entrenando cuando llegue el maratón recuerden ya los consejos tengan otro vídeo cuántos días descansar antes del maratón que yo ya les he dicho 10 días antes es mucho mejor de esa manera ustedes podrán lograr su meta ahora intermedios lo mismo también la misma clave la misma clave y les aseguro que ustedes van a ganar o se van a mejorar su tiempo ahora los avanzados si ustedes se entrenan de el primer año y descansan un mes otra vez y me vuelven entregar los avanzados, yo les voy a decir una cosa los principiantes solamente bajamos de peso y logramos en que sea caminando terminamos el maratón, 26.2 millas o 42 kilómetros los intermedios como ya tenemos un cuerpo bueno o sea ya bajamos ya tenemos buena tonificación aguantamos más y mejoramos nuestro tiempo garantizado pero los avanzados mis chicos chicas monitas que ya tienen un buen cuerpo que ya no más están un poquito más de fuerza entonces hay que bajar a todo lo que da, miren por si un ejemplo yo yo mido unos 5-5 aquí en pies y mi peso debe de estar en 1.20 o 1.25 entonces o sea 125 o 120 sin embargo yo ahorita estoy empezando 135 tengo que bajar hasta 125 para cuando se llegue ese tiempo mi peso ya no me va a estorbar más aparte los intervalos y ya se ha abogado la clave Si ustedes entrenan de esa manera les aseguro que en 1925 días los avanzados van a ganar la carrera. Ahora, mucha gente me pregunta, Alex, ¿síos quieren entrenar en la mañana y en la noche? Bueno, aquí está la clave. Platicaban con los de Kenyan. Ellos entrenan de esa manera. Entranas en la mañana y en la noche. Ahora, en la mañana, pues, es el que hacen un long run y en la noche hacen un short distance, o sea, en pocas palabras, en la mañana, largas distancias y en la noche cortas distancias ahora pero entonces dicen pero cómo entonces cómo se recuperan bueno aquí viene la clave si tú puedes dormir 14 horas si te recomiendo entrenar la mañana y en la noche pero si no puedes dormir 14 horas es mejor nada más entrenar una vez por día seis días a la semana y un día descansarlo siempre es así para la recuperación del cuerpo pero sí pero como los hablaba de queña o de estiopia y corredores que me están mirando si es que me tienen en español ahorita y como entrenar cada día como le dije principiantes el primer año el segundo año el tercer año les aseguro muchos de los principiantes por muy grande toto toto toto te que estén vas a poder terminar un maratón corriendo a mi caminando pero lo vas a terminar y tal vez hasta corriendo también intermedios mejorarán su tiempo 100% y los avanzados mis queridos amigos se me enfocan con la dieta con el aeróbico con la zonificación o sea con todo y otra cosa un tip más cada día que te levantes mira te les pejo y dice hoy voy a entrenar hoy voy a correr hoy voy a ganar y antes de dormir imagínate que estás corriendo cómo estás corriendo qué tan rápido estás corriendo todos los días si es posible esa si no lo dejé de hacer día y noche y verás que en mil 95 días habrás ganado o habrás logrado tu meta pero los avanzados o los que ya son, ganarán un maratón, se lo garantizó. Suerte a mis amigos.","Hello all my friends, I am happy with all of you, remember a hug wherever you are for me you are unique and unique so a hug where you are in any country I left my glasses because you told me that I look nice when I wear the glasses so it's true, it's sunny but hey a greeting a hug today we are going to talk about a advice a very good secret even the title 1095 days is very important that you listen to this that I am going to be talking about at this moment For beginners, this type of training, my people want to change their lives, want to become athletes or runners, people who want to be dynamic, who want to change their health, since if they are too hard or anything else, in 1095 days you can change all that or you can achieve your goal. And now I'm going to explain why. For beginners, if you are a person who is trying to get off the track, and you weigh a lot and you want to run a race or a marathon in 1095 days you will be able to achieve it now I will explain the workouts now the intermediate person the intermediate people who are already running my friends who have already been starting to run marathon but they want to achieve a marathon I am talking about 26.2 miles now we are going to do something very specific I assure you that if you train as I was talking right now In 1095 days you will achieve a good time. If your time is 4 hours, for that day it will be 2 and so, I do not know, 2.50, 2.40, but if you are going to achieve it, that is, if you are going to achieve it, exceed all that time, you are going to achieve it. Now, if you are an advanced, I guarantee you that you are going to, not only are you going to achieve it, but that you can be the one who wins the marathon. Now, why do I tell you this? Well, I have talked to coaches and runners of Kenya, Ethiopia, and all the riders who always win the marathon and there is a key between this type of training now if you train for beginners if you train the first month the diet, the tonification and aerobic exercise and remember all the videos are there on my channel you can see them in the first year they train at least 11 months very hard 5 days a week or 6 days a week saving their diet, trying to do what is best and then the 11 months train your diet and then a month, either in January or the last month, as you feel better, you rest without doing anything and then start again training the next year, again lowering your body, toning and the third year now if as you have already lowered, as you have already toned, as you already have, now if you are a beginner, a beginner, I assure you that at least when you go to the marathon, you will not have much pain as when you train, that's why I'm telling you, 1095 days is very important now, the first year a month, the second year again rest in a month and the third year at least rest a month but in the middle, that is, after the six months that they have been training again with their goal that they have been doing, they rest and then they continue to train Remember, when the marathon comes, the tips are in the other video. How many days to rest before the marathon. I have already told you, 10 days before is much better. In this way you will be able to do your meta. Intermediates, the same key. And I assure you that you will win or you will improve your time. The advances. If you train for the first year and rest once a month. The advanced ones, I'll tell you one thing, the beginners only lower the weight and we manage to walk, we finish the marathon, 26.2 miles or 42 kilometers. The intermediate ones, as we already have a good body, that is, we already lower, we already have good tonification, we hold on more and improve our time, guaranteed, but the advanced ones, my little girls, that already have a good body, that already no longer, are a little more than strength then you have to go down to everything that gives look for example I measure 155 here I start and my weight should be in 120 or 125 then 125 or 120 however I am now starting 135 I have to go down to 125 for when my weight reaches that time it will no longer disturb me more apart from the intervals If you train like this, I assure you that in 1095 days the advanced will win the race. Now, many people ask me, Alex, I want to train in the morning and at night. Well, here is the key. I talked to the little ones, they train like this, they train in the morning and at night. Now, in the morning they do a long run and in the night they do a short distance, or in short words, in the morning, long distances and at night short distances now but then they say but how they all recover well here comes the key if you can sleep 14 hours if I recommend you to train tomorrow and at night but if you can't sleep 14 hours it's better to just train once a day six days a week and one day to rest it is always like that for the recovery of the body but if but as I spoke about Kenya or Ethiopia and runners who are looking at me if they understand me in Spanish right now some days in English but they train in the morning in the afternoon they sleep or eat after they eat they relax they sleep they get up again and they train again when they return they sleep again and another day they return and that is their routine I know runners who in 1095 days have achieved their goal but I'm already telling you the key you have to focus on it you have to do it as I am explaining in my other videos I told you, beginners, the first year, the second year, the third year, I assure you, many of the beginners, for a very big tototototote, you will be able to finish a marathon walking, but you will finish it and you will see it running too. Intermediates will improve their time 100%. And advanced ones, my dear friends, they focus on the diet, with the aerobic, with the tonification, that is, with everything, and another tip every day you get up, look at the mirror and say today I'm going to train today I'm going to run today I'm going to win and before sleeping imagine that you are running how are you running how fast you are running every day if it is possible that is if I did not let you do it day and night and you will see that in 1095 days you will have won or you will have achieved your goal but the They will be able to guarantee it. Good luck."

And indeed, there is much more of you than a lot of cheese. Won't you be understanding? This is Hell, which you were promised. They have fixed it today, because you were disbelieving. And if We had willed, We would have put a seal on them. 162. And if We had willed, We would have touched them on their place. But they were not able to escape, and they would not return. And whoever sees it, we will put him to sleep in the back. Will they not understand? 182. And they take a gift from it, that they may be helped. 193. They cannot help them, and they will have a group to be prepared. 22. And forgot his creation. He said, Describe the bones, Describe it, which He has created once, and He is with every creature upon it. 23. For you are from the green tree, and when it is recited. In the Qur'an"

This is a complicated product and it's important that you deal with someone like me that's a specialist. I'm independent, I deal with all the major carriers which is very important. I'm also Virginia State Partnership approved and you can click on the partnership link to find out more about the protections you get with that. Instead of trying to get into the complexities of this project, I'm just going to share with you a conversation I had with an existing client. I just got a phone call the other day from a client of mine named Mark. Mark has put his mother in a nursing home. He's spending about $5,900 a month for this nursing home. Now, the thing a lot of people forget is there's also a tax cost to this because they're liquidating assets. They're paying approximately 15% for capital gains. She's in the 20% 28% tax bracket. So really he's spending just under $8,500 a month after tax. As you can see, this is pretty expensive. Now she's been at home for about two years. They already spent approximately $218,000 for her care at home. If she's in the nursing home for just one year, the total cost of her long-term care will be about $300,000, which is the typical claim. Now, bear in mind, they have provided a lot of her care. If they had a policy for her, it would have paid for all of those expenses with no tax consequence and provided services such as home modifications, emergency response systems, any transportation, nurses, therapists, and a privileged care coordinator, which all the major policies offer, and that's just an advocate. a third party advocate to look out for you, help you with claims, and work with your family. The most important thing here, though, is that a policy would have relieved the burden from his family. People come to me and say, I want to protect assets, John, but they usually purchase this insurance because they don't want to burden their loved ones. That would have freed Mark and his family up to spend more time with her instead of coordinating care and all the things that they had to do for her. So when Mark called me, he just thanked me. He said, John, thank you so much. I'm so glad I'm not gonna have to put my children through this. So give me a ring, fill out the quick quote below, and we can get this process started. This is a fairly complicated product. That's why I specialize in it. A lot of local CPAs, attorneys, estate planning attorneys and financial planners use me because I'm a specialist and they know I can take care of this product for their clients. It's a very customizable product and it's a very complicated industry to navigate. Just like your primary care physician would send you to an orthopedic surgeon if you had a knee problem, these local professionals will send clients to me because they know this is a specialized product. There's a link below for what's called a quick quote. Just click on that. That'll start the process and start the dialogue with us and I can start customizing a policy for you to take this burden off of your loved ones. Thank you, I look forward to working with you.","Hi, I'm John Spachek, I'm the President of Long Term Care Services and I'm sure you're here for information about long term care insurance.

Here I show you how to make a successful mixdown in Sonar. Some further editing is done in Sony Sound Forge,"example, sonar, audio, tutorial, sound, export, lesson, sony, master, mixdown, teach, forge",29599,52,46,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/nd2r-KKAPEI.mp3,"We're going to look at exporting audio in sonar, which is nothing more than a mix down. This song I have open here will do as an example. I have several audio tracks and a couple of MIDI tracks. The idea of a mix down is just to take all these tracks and turn them into one stereo file. Let's have a listen. Now I hear all the tracks playing. If this was going on to a cassette I'd simply pop a new tape into the machine and hit record and let it run. But things are different now. To make a CD or an mp3 we need to mix these down into one stereo. The exporting process is very simple and since the organ track is played on a virtual synthesizer it will be included in the mix. But one of my MIDI tracks is playing back on my piano and needs to first be recorded into audio. With software synthesizers you can simply render them, but for this I have to actually record it in real time. I'll solo the MIDI track and arm an audio track for recording. My piano is already plugged into my mixing board so it's easy to send it to the the signal from there. For you, you might have to actually unplug some wires and plug things in different to make your MIDI feedback into the computer. Once this piano line is recorded, it will be included when I make a mixdown. And with these newer versions of Sonar, I don't have to render the software since it's freezed them either. The mixdown does all that for me. So now that that's done, I simply need to select all the parts. It's going to be difficult to get them this way, but I'll go to select all. I want to show you where that is but I'd normally use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-A. So once all the parts are selected, we can go to File, Export, Audio. I'm going to export this as a wave file and I want it to include all the settings that I've made in the program so that the volume of each track and the effects and so on will all be included. I'll save that on my computer and now I want to open that file up so that you can see what that looks like. I've opened it in Sony Soundforge. This is a great program for doing your final mastering. It's a good chance to get rid of the silence at the beginning of the song. When I hit play, I don't want to wait three seconds before the music starts. I'd also go to the end of the song where I could apply a fade out, or at least trim the silence away from there too. Another step I always take in this program is to normalize. When you normalize, it means the loudest part of your song won't go over a set amount. In this case that's just below 0 dB. Now I have a mix that should play at a pretty standard volume compared to other CDs.","We're going to look at exporting audio in sonar, which is nothing more than a mix down.

Ne parliamo con Giuseppe Zagarella di PD per Imperia. e sono un progetto comune su persone che hanno state risposte a un gioco, su un progetto condiviso e ovviamente alla città compreso, c'è idea, ha scommesso questa idea, questo ci impone un grande senso di responsabilità perché ovviamente l'imperio si aspetta con un seguito governo all'altezza. Quindi alla fine la scelta della famosa alleanza è stata una scelta vincente, Perchè non si, perché l'istacco sono un signale molto forte, non si vuole di qualità, cioè che si sarà da avuttaggio, assaggiato, di un delicato, per le sue lezioni, e spagliare l'unica, ma interiormente spiegare che sono i passaggi che qualificheranno questa coalizione, un intergetto che fa di una relazione organica, serie, c'è stata la protesta dell'astensionismo ma non la protesta di grillo, è stato un flop quello di grillo Se su base nazionale voglio dare copia a un'occa a un momento che è il livello locale, penso io forse mi sbaglio che una politica fondata su no avuca cosa in realtà non sia una politica pagante e poi forse a livello locale non è tanto un titolo quali sono stati le motivazioni che tra io e me la francese diretta del reto e una delle poche lezioni in cui il cittadino italiano può uscire sia il candidato sinca perché il consigliere è personale, sapendo che può tirare i reti quando lo smaglie, sapendo che vuò in qualche modo riportarlo al bordo di me se assombrere le abitizioni che non sono in una terrestre della coletività. si è fatto troppo fumo e ha fatto un riuscito sul simbolo come che ha risultato anche la specializzazione del buono.","10 sections left, 44 total and we can go to the swimming pool with 20 points on the anon We are talking about a common project, about people who were willing to play in the game, on the division project, and obviously the city that was taken over by the idea, to spread this idea, this puts us in a great sense of responsibility because obviously the empire is expecting a government position in the city.

I think that the right-wing society is one of the few elections in which the Italian citizen can choose, both the candidate and the candidate, personally, knowing that he can continue his career, knowing that he can somehow bring it back to the board, if he assumes the administration that he will not be in the community."

Well, it's kind of getting late and kind of getting tired, but the injectors wired up. I had a coolant temperature sensors wired. Megasort called for a twisted wire pair.

Chucked the other side into my drill and just ran it down until it became a nice uniform piece of wire. wire. and the water temp is for the air to water intercooler. Just going to monitor the temps coming out of that heat exchanger. Top over here is the wide band, boost vac and last oil pressure. So this is all turbo related and this is just general maintenance on this side. And this is where the mega squirt is going to mount. Just got a punch hole in the back of that.

So, well, just keep working.","Well good good afternoon again, this is Southwest 82 still working on the E9 Suzuki GTI turbo Back up at the shop. I'm doing the primary wiring for the Megasquirt. I've got it all assembled the stem is Right next to it Working off of Carlos Wiring diagram got everything laid out right now. I'm just trying to Get everything wired up properly got a couple extra fuses in there just to make sure I don't blow something. But what we've got so far, I've got the engines all assembled out. The wires are in place. Sorry I've kind of messed up the wiring harness right now, but I had to make a new bracket for the battery because I'm using an Optima Red Top and it doesn't exactly sit in the standard position, so I've made a little cradle for it. Due to the downpipe on the turbo, I had to move the radiator over just a little bit so I fabricated it. get some brackets, very simple. There's just some bar that bent around. There's a cradle underneath that pulls it. And as for the turbo itself, I did wind up going with the Garrett Z25. Currently the gate is set, I believe, to 7 pounds. I'm just going to start with that for now. I'm 2.5 inch downpipe coming off. And as you can see, the gap between the radiator and the downpipe is fairly close. And this is just the transmission cooler that I've got sitting in there loose. right now. I haven't hooked up the transmission cooler or the air to water intercooler line yet. Look underneath the car, see the oil for the turbo, the return drain. Those two lines hanging down on the water supply for the turbo. We've got to finish that.

I know your fortune is to have nice easy use But here and I'll take the weight of your arm for now. Yeah There are three arches of the palm. There's ones that one that goes from the thumb to the side of the hand that goes in like this There's one that goes from the bottom of the palm to the top of the palm We know that one where you bend your hand like this when this comes together. So this movement here Yeah, and then there's one that goes from your thumb to your little finger this way So we're going to widen all those arches. I'm going to take the weight of your arm, you can let your hand hang. And we're just going to widen them by, like we talked about before with your neck releasing and your head going away from your spine and your spine lengthening. Very nice and your back widening. We're going to let that coordination of your body, especially that back widening and lengthening, come out through your hand and through your fingers. So I'll take the weight of your arm again. Yeah. And just you do that nice thinking where you let your neck release. Very nice your head go forward and up your back widen and lengthen. Yeah, and that actually comes out through your hand. That's What what very nice what widens your hands all the way from the bottom of your hips and That gives you that nice easy use of your thumb. There's a nice joint here for our thumb when our thumb moves It moves from in here. We also have this joint and this joint We have a nice movement here and quite often people get a little stuck and they leave their hand like this for years. So because we often use our thumb over this way, but it's nice to just let that release out again by starting with your neck releasing your head going a little bit forward and up your back widening and lengthening into releasing your thumb out from your back. There you go. And I'll take the weight of your arm once again. Good. So this gets, yes, a nice free movement there. Good. And you get that nice widening of your palm. Now the joints, I'm going to turn your arm over again. knuckle joint here that we can so easily see here. When we turn your hand over we're going to look and see where is it, where is it here. And a lot of people think that it's across here, but actually it's right about here. See when you bend your hand? Yep, it's right in there. So that joint when you bend your hand is right in here that bends. Just like you're doing a funny wave, funny wave from here. It's right in the middle of your palm. Yes, we get that nice easy bend across here. Yeah, and your wrist no matter what you're doing your wrist always stays free. Our wrists are like our necks. They stay free and our palms kind of like our heads. In fact our fingers are like little sort of like little bodies with heads on the end. This last joint here is like a little neck and these are like little heads on the end and they release a little bit away from those little necks and the whole fingers lengthen. That's even if you're holding on to something, even if you're grabbing something pretty tight. The little necks here in this last joint release and the little heads of the lat, those fingers lengthen and go away from little necks and that gets you a good grip. Gives you a very, very good grip. If you release this last joint of your fingers, again with the idea that it starts with your neck releasing and your head going, allowing your head to go forward and up, away from the top of your spine, your spine to lengthen, your back to widen. And allowing that to come through your arms and hands, always your head, neck, and spine being primary. But releasing this last joint of your fingers, so it's like these little necks release and these little heads continue lengthening. So if you're playing the guitar and needing to press down on the strings, your fingers almost continue going right through those strings instead of tightening which starts pulling them away if you tighten your arm. They actually lengthen through to the neck of the guitar. If you're playing the piano, these last joints release and that leads that let's there be room for this, these little heads to lead and the whole rest of the joints in your fingers and your arms with free wrists to follow that all the way from your back and all the way from that nice free head neck and back of your body out through your fingers so they move very freely and easily in all the joints and the rest coordinates with them. And also if you are playing the violin or even holding the bow, how you might let the ends of your fingers lengthen a little bit and leave these joints free and your wrists free in order to really be able to use your back much more. If you are playing a wind instrument and you have the keys here pressing down on the keys just that freed on there let your hands move your fingers move so much more quickly and freely and leaves your arms much freer","Let's talk about hands now and how to have a nice free wrist how to have a nice free palm and easy joints of your hand whether you're typing working at the computer whether you're Reaching for something holding on to something I'm going to go ahead and turn your hand over and we're going to we're going to look at the palm not to read your palm until you're fortunate Oh, yes.

I wanted to be a dental assistant because it's part of the healing profession and there's nothing more rewarding or personally gratifying than helping people and making them feel better. The dental department does a great job teaching you all the different skills you need to be of a professional dental team.

In the labs we have two instructors for 12 to 15 students, and in the clinics we have a one-to-three instructor-student ratio.

Dus het is nu een man tekort en het is zanger, maar die is een jam en ze liefblikbaar. Hoe lang bestel je er al? Het is 6 maart. We hebben een jaar of zo punk gespeeld. Ja, we hebben zo'n pas een nieuwe MCD opgenomen en die zal binnen een maand of zo uitkomen. Met vier nieuwe nummers. Ik heb er al een hele grote duurt over. Ik heb mijn nummers opnemen om zo hier en daar naar wat organisatoren te sturen. Maar echt het planen voor CD of demo echt niet. Ik weet niet of ik dat er nou bij kan zijn. Maar vanaf volgend jaar, ik begin kei een van de band om mee te begeleiden. Om toch wel meer variatie te kunnen krijgen met muziek. Ik ben de zesbeelde met Timmy, een heel goede moot van ik. Ik zei, Tim, ik kon hier bijna mijn gitaar spelen. Dus ik ben beter bij hem met het droom. Eigenlijk om Luc Duffermond beter te leren kennen. Dat is wel een gemens. Ro Aron. Ja, Ro Aron. En die papa is een toerust in cowboys. En voor de seks? Deze is de spas. Daar kun je me helemaal beluisteren. En op Facebook blijkbaar ook. Dank u wel. We zijn echt allemaal voor ons gekomen. Ik vind dat heel sympathiek. Wij zijn de Pretty Boys. We zijn met vier normaal, maar de drummers zijn beneden. Ergens in de backstage. Par vrouwen aan het lichtsturen. We bestaan sinds 2006. Maar twee jaar alleen hebben we ook megedaan met West Talent. Ik ga er voorhanden met stick nummer 8. Bijna gewoon, maar net niet. Maar hopelijk deze keer beter, wie zie je wel. We gaan toch maar hingen om toch een beetje muziek te maken. Het zijn eigenlijk allemaal vrienden. We komen allemaal uit een andere muziekhalen milieu. Maar uiteindelijk hebben we toch een beslist om rock muziek te spelen. En ik heb iets nieuws te proberen. Wij zijn de tips uit de brugge poperingen. We spelen al redelijk langzaam muziek. En we proberen... We gaan de oude gloryjaarden terug brengen, het jaar 1670. We geloven er eigenlijk in dat je de oude ding ook nog op een nieuwe manier kan doen. Ja. We konden ook meedoen aan het Oostvlam-Zrok on Coeur. Waar onze demo was nog niet klaar. En dan gezien dat we echt een westvlaming zijn. Wij zijn samen begonnen op Saint-Zolder, de zolder van Bakker Ivo in Roesbrugge. En zonder dat we eigenlijk komt We hebben gewoon instrumenten gekocht en beginnen, oefenen. De eerste nummer gaat over Immatuliel MacKennan, over Superman. Ik ben Sanne, ik ben de bassist. Onze saxofonist is er al niet meer, die is terug naar Antwerpen. Ben, ben. En daarnaast Laurence, de drummer, die eigenlijk ook al terug weg is naar Antwerpen. Dus, dat is niet moeilijk. Je gaat naar Do Cajos van Gohend. Je klikt op conservatorium en je beeldt alle musicanten op dat je ziet. En dan doe je met de overblijvende, warm je bandje. Zo is het eigenlijk niet special. Deel aan stalige muziek, op West Talent gebracht worden denk ik. Ik ook, heel rare is de lakenhallen van Nieperzin en weet deze ook eens te zien.","We are Mightsphere, that's Walter Kers, Tony Wittebulle. We are from Iper, we make the Mangle Mousse of everything. Oh yes, Ambissie, just making fun of it. I wrote my own, just looking for a roof, selecting it. Everything is more than a hen. So, better in between in the studio. So, we are in Sabotage. It's only a short time now, but it's a jam with CD. How long have we been here? It's 6, but we played punk for a year or so. We just took a new MCD and it will be released in a month or so. We are not really told that for the famous time, it's really to do that. That's nonsense. That's what they say especially for the fans. I'm Weszo. I'm a big fan of Jakey's Balloon Flight. I wanted to have fun here. I'm more interested in how far I can get with my songs. I'm really proud of the fact that I'm in the last 56. I'm going to record new songs soon. I'm not planning for demos, but I'm going to record them. I was recording my songs to send them to some organizers. I was planning to do a CD or a demo. I don't know if I can say that there is a chance. But from the following year I'm starting to look for a band to lead me. To get more variations with my music. I'm Bones with Timmy, I think he's a good musician. I told Timmy I could play my guitar here. So I started dreaming better. Actually, to learn to play the drums better. That's what I did. One demo, the beautiful title, the knockdown those came in, they are escape and cave. And also a number that you call that. But unfortunately it's not on. You can listen to me for nothing. And on Facebook, Blikbarok. Thank you. You really came all the way here. I think it's very nice. We are the Pretty Boys. We are with four normal, but the drummer is down somewhere in the backstage. A few women and a little girl. We have been here since 2006. But two years ago we also did it with West Talent. I'm going to win almost all the time, but hopefully this time I'll do better. The reward is given to a new record, so it's in the record. I'm going to try to put a new song on my space every month. I've searched 3 nerds. We are all friends, we all come from a different musical background. But we decided to play rock music and try something new. We are the tips from Brugge Popering. We play pretty slow music and we try to play We are a bit of the old glory years back in the 60s and 70s. We believe that the old thing can be done in a new way. We could also participate in the East Flamens Rock & Co. Where the demo was not yet finished. And then we saw that we really were in the West Flaming. We started at Saint-Zolder, the Zolder van Bakker-Uvo in Roesbrugge. We have just been to the instruments, started to practice. This song is about I'm a son, I'm the bassist. Our saxophonist isn't here anymore, he's back to Antwerp. And besides that, Lawrence, the drummer, who's back to Antwerp. So that's not difficult. You go to Do Cagos by Goent. You click on the conservatory and you call all the musicians to sit down. And then you do the remaining warm-up band. That's not special. I think they are brought to West Talent with stale music. I also see the Lakenhallen of Nieper. And I know that I have seen it too."

So once again, a big applause for the former Polish footballers who have also changed the players who appeared on TV. We won 7 matches in a row, we didn't win the match, we are the best. You are giving us your support, thank you. I would like to welcome new players, like you did 4 years ago. I would like to do the same with new players, they will help us this season.

One thing that I feel good about here in the Wroclaw, because my daughter was born here and she is a Wroclawian, so I'm not sure about that. And the last thing, that people will come out now, on the stage, which is not seen enough, but those who are involved in this success and help in this training, in this ride, in this training, in this preparation for the match, so please take it as you take us, the players, it will definitely be a great pleasure.

На опушении пожара были задействованы 25 специалистов, две мобильные группы из Ваучевского и Судского лесничества, пожарная череповца Кадуя Хохлова, работали две модели, Сейчас главное локализовать, не дать пожару дальше распространиться. Плюс ко всему из сутского участкового лесничества. Сейчас едет еще мобильная группа, 5 человек вот буквально с минуту на минуту подъеду с мото-помпами. Будем дальше работать. Так на месте работали 4 пожарных расчета и одна машина лескоза. Сюда же подъехал трактор и погрузчик. В задачу засыпать огонь зублёй, чтобы он не распространялся дальше. Кстати, погрузчик предоставили добровольцы. Работник лагеря Жемчужина Мологи. Детский центр отдыха от Чеговсгорания. Совсем недореко, всего в двух километрах.

The fire itself is not a fire, but it is really very difficult to extinguish it. The fire grew in the eyes of the fire. The fire was fixed at about 14.00 and literally in a few hours, its area increased from 2 to 10 hectares. The fire was set on 25 specialists. Two mobile groups from the Wauchivsk and Sudskvolesnichestvo fire brigade, Kadu and Khokhlova worked together. Now the main thing is to localize, not to let the fire spread further. Plus, the whole day of the school summer, now there is still a mobile group, 5 people, literally a minute by minute, I will go with the motorbikes, we will continue to work. So, four fire calculations and one car from the Kuzo were working in place. The tractor and loader came here, their task is to fill the fire with soil, so that it does not spread further. By the way, the loader was provided with a good driver, a working head of the Zhymchuzhnyi Mologe. The children's center of rest, from Chigavzgoran, is very close to the river, only 2 kilometers. It's the most important thing in the fire. I've worked for 7 years and I've never had such a fire. The grass is prepared, it must be, it's cut out and it's made of spah. The strip, they left the juice, they burned it, they left it. That's the reason for the fire. According to the specialists, the reason for the fire is probably the fire extinguisher. The statistics of the fire extinguisher are almost all the fire that occurs in the human womb. Only 5% of the fire is in the nature. The area is 840 hectares. This information was heard during the meeting of the commission. At the moment, 78 people were appointed to the administrative office. The fire in the area of the Mologyn foreign military camp is currently in operation. It has not been completed yet. The specialists of the Ochev forestry are still working in the area."

For every traditional tradition, and for every previous tradition, I suggest that this is the true reality that we come out of the history lesson and the traditions that are the results of traditional traditions that are more complicated and more complicated We have been talking about the end of the human civilization. for the famous Arabs and Muslims in the fields of knowledge, literature, science and art. From what he gave at the end of the matter, we have clearly applied what we mentioned to him, that for every one of them, there is a clear clear evidence. Since many of the Arabs and Muslims, the old and the present, are eager to see in the eyes of the The effect of which made the Arabian civilization in Europe. It is a project that is aimed at the human history and in our reality. But it does not represent the reality except the half of the reality. So, I see in the Arabic heritage, without its continuation, in the context of this tradition. It is a matter of the appearance of a imaginary image of this tradition. An image of a mental one, not a reality. It is an image that really shaped the minds of people. And it was given to some, certainly, as a lie, that this Arab-Islamic civilization, and what it was given from human heritage, was just a surprise. The Islamic Revolution and the Arab world's leadership began, and this was the same situation, and then it was settled on a throne. These days, we are dealing with it among people. It is as if we were running away from the principles of previous and advanced. This is a great understanding of nature. We have not been able to share the Quranic verse with it in the reality. between people and their transition, not to the city, but to the laws and regulations. There must be no meaning in it, and there must be no understanding in it, even to reach a real message with the previous opinion, and therefore, a clear message at the present moment. The previous ones expressed their opinions, then they confirmed their scientific book which reached us from the pages of the Qur'an and from that, the words of the Prophet, of course. The result of this is a result of a failure. And it will be clear later on, that this issue has started to be created. That is the true faith that has been established by religions that have been passed down to this ancient region of the world. and Christianity and Islam. Although this true faith and the rational rule is a sign of the first creation and the beginning of existence, the majority think that each creation is the first creation. They understand that nothing becomes the surprise of every existence. From here, they are enthralled by their desires, dreams, and other realities. Is the legal rule required? This is the Quranic verse which confirmed that the previous time for Islam was more legal. The most important thing is to think that ignorance is nothing or it is the form of the normal and to realize that ignorance is ignorance as long as Islam is knowledge. And it is the darkness as long as Islam is light. And from there, the mind goes to the delusions and realizes that the Arab civilization, Islamism, has appeared, has disappeared suddenly in the human race The first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of the first creation of Allah is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One"

Freut mich, dass ihr da seid. Das fängt gut an. Ja, auch für mich ein wunderschönes Guten Abend. Schön, dass heute wieder so viele Leute da sind. Und danke, dass ich den Vortrag hier machen darf. Probieren wir zusammen. Hallo? Hallo? Hallo? So besser? Ich sage nochmal kurz, das ist die Einleitung. Ich bin Felix Büsching, wurde gerade schon gesagt. Das ist ein Informatikinstitut. Dort rögen einmal über die Straße. Ich habe ihn zum Anfang in Wort mitgebracht. Und zwar folgendes. Powerpoint macht mich nicht. ist das ja mein zweiter Vortrag. Beim letzten Mal musste ich ja dieses Hirn mit nach Hause nehmen und beim letzten Mal habe ich Ihnen etwas zu meinem Projekt Gestaltung altersgerechter Lebenswelten erzählt. Da geht es darum, wir haben mit einem immer älter werdenden Gesellschaft, da ist an der Wand, dass die Alterspyramide, die gar nicht bei einer Pyramide aussieht für 2050 mit ganz viel alten Leuten, ganz viel mittel alten Leuten und alle haben sich in den Zippern leihen und ganz wenig Junge und ich habe gesagt, wir können da oben nicht dran schneiden. Auch wenn wir im unteren Bereich für mehr Basis sorgen wollen, soll das nicht Teil dieses Vortrags, sondern vielleicht hinterher. Ich wollte Ihnen letztes Mal dann ganz viel Technik in die Wohnung stellen, damit wir sie überwachen. Zum Beispiel habe ich die Schutzerkennung vorgestellt, anhand eines Beschleunigungssensors. Die junge Dame dort trägt einen Beschleunigungssensor am Würfel und der Beschleunigungssensor funktioniert vollermaßen. Er nimmt die Beschleunigung auf und wenn wenig Beschleunigung da ist, dann kann man daran merken, oder steht vielleicht und wenn aber plötzlich eine ganz krasse Änderung in der Beschleunigung da ist, dann könnte man feststellen, okay, der hat sich ordentlich gemauelt. Im dem Fall könnte dann ein intelligentes System, das über Funk benachrichtigt wird, das auswerten und Hilfe holen. Ein anderes Beispiel war die Aktivitätsüberwachung, wo wir Ihnen ganz, ganz viele Sensoren in die Wohnung packen wollen und erkennen wollen, was sie denn so machen den ganzen Tag über, um dann Änderungen in der Aktivität festzustellen, um dann eben zu sagen, okay, wir greifen mal besser auf, bevor der Oberschränkelheitsbruder ist und ich erst danach. Das waren die Ziele dieses Projekts. Wir wollen das klein integriert und vor allem drahtlos machen und das ist die Motivation für den Vortrag, den ich jetzt halten will, nämlich wie funktioniert eigentlich WLAN. Das hat jeder zu Hause so ein WLAN-Router, vielleicht ein drahtloses Laptop angebunden und ein weiteres Device oder mehrere ist egal, aber es steckt dahinter. Machen wir erstmal eine Begriffsklärung. WLAN steht für Wireless, Local, Area, Network, Ein LAN ist ziemlich genau in der Mitte zwischen einem Pan und einem MAN. Ein Pan ist ein Personal Area Network. Das ist unser Body Network. Da können wir zum Beispiel den Beschleunigungs-Sensor vorhin und wenn die Dame dann auch noch einen Blutdruck-Sensor trägt und einen Schrittzähler und die Sachen ein Netzwerk bilden, dann ist das ein Personal Area Network, ein Pan. Ein MAN ist ein Metropolitan Area Network. Also ein Personal Area Network. Wir können über Atome nachdenken und gucken, was so auf Atom-Hara-Ebene passiert. Die Daten sind auf den Feldern gekommen. richtig das kabel und dieses kabel kann","This is the Wachsweiger TU from the Institute for Business Systems and Law and Justice. This is the end of the video. I wish you a wonderful evening. Thank you for being here today. Let's try together. Parascapillic Decatriaphobia This is my second lecture, last time I had to take this film home. And last time I told you what my project design, Alters' fair life, tells. This is why we always have an older society. There is on the wall that the older pyramids, which looks like a pyramid for 2050, with a lot of old people, a lot of middle-aged people and all have a little bit of a zipper and very little younger. And I said we can't cut it up there. I want to show you a lot of technology in the housing so we can monitor them. For example, I have the protection experience. With a speed sensor, the young lady there carries a speed sensor in the middle and the speed sensor works as follows. It takes the speed up and if there is little speed, you can notice that the human being is not in the middle of the house. or maybe he is standing there and if suddenly a very bad change in acceleration is there, then you could say ok, he has not really been bitten. In this case, a intelligent system could be used to evaluate and help. Another example was the activity surveillance, where we want to put a lot of sensors in the apartment and recognize what they do all day to make changes in the activity system, to say ok, we will take a better look at the system Before the overshadowing is over, I'll go first. That was the goal of this project. We want to integrate it and make it wireless. And that's the motivation for the progress I want to keep now. Namely, how does actually work with WLAN? Everyone has that at home. Such a router, a WLAN router, maybe a wireless laptop. And a wireless device or several is no matter. But what's behind it? Let's first do a concept. WLAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network. Wireless, wireless, local area network, LAN, a LAN is in the middle between a PAN and a MAN. A PAN is a personal area network. This is our body network. We can use it to accelerate sensors. If the lady carries a blood pressure sensor and a step-pattern and the network builders use it, it is a personal area network and a PAN. A MAN is a metropolitan area network. You can think about how to build an antenna on a capacitor or how to send data to it. I forgot something. There are media access processes in between. That's why it's important to know why it's interesting. The cable."

Mi-a răspuns un tovară Jluka, nu știu cine fie să răcu. Mi-a spus că el și alți câzva care fac parte dintr-un Comitet Național, sunt acolo 22 de cembrie, ora 3, fara un sfert, ora la care tovarășul Iliescu apare pentru prima dată în fața Națiuni, prezentat ca un erou multașteptat. Între timp, în sediul Comitetului Central, diferite persoane sugerează oameni lor dinăuntru necesitatea venire acestor.

Crearea Consilului Frontului Salvării Naționale se face în spatele ușilor închise.","The events of December 1989 were not in the same way as all the other countries, and so far they have been too little attempts to remove the truth of appearance. So it is clear that each of us, coming with different personal experiences, we do not see with that shock the further evolution of this event. We do not want to accuse anyone without arguments, but what is certain is the fact that what is The people who died because our lives have to change fundamentally are the last ones who can still be discredited. Let's remember how many of us saw the same things. It's a first step, but we understand one thing. The Central Committee's headquarters is at the center of the city. All the officials who can be involved in this construction work that we are talking about today are coming. Including those six militants of the party who gave a dose of patriotism, who addressed the countries who made an appeal to the Luciditate and to the Ceausescu, who had become incapable of something like that. The Central Committee of the Parliament is the representative of the population. I spoke to the number one cabinet on the phone. I was no longer the number one person, nor the secretary of this person. I was told by a friend, Luca, I don't know who he was, he told me that he and some other guy who is part of the National Committee are there, 22 December, 3 a.m. in the middle of the night, the Iliescu's comrade appears for the first time in front of the UN, presented as a very awaited hero. Meanwhile, in the headquarters of the Central Committee, different people suggest to the people from the inside the need to come here. The fact that the dance was a colleague with the comrade Gorbachev, saying that he wanted to be the conductor, should not be. The government is the power of the politicians. From the beginning, the police have stood without communism. The army wants the political power to be taken away from the democratic institutions of the free people. Mr. Roman, here, the Romanian government supports the fact that the new-grown organization, the National Salvation Front, will take over the old political power that was before the Romanian Communist Party. We want to know what's going on here! We want to be in control! We want to be in control! If we don't organize ourselves, we won't be organized! The creation of the National Salvation Front is behind closed doors."

Non hanno saputo dirgli allo subito di posti terapino di corpi senza vita. Ne hanno recuperati 76. Per lo più ragazzi di cui faccio pulite, oggi vediamo in un sito e sui giornali. Le facce di giovani che non vedranno realizzati i loro sogni, che sono poi i sogni di tanti, dei migliori di quelli che credono in cui valori che la bestialità di un mostro ha cercato di cancellare. che non li suggeriscono, non li prevedono sotto nessun punto di vista, noi testimoni restiamo ancora più sconcertati. Non esiste forse un luogo sicuro per chi crede nella convivenza rispettosa dei paesi democratici. La Norvegia piange ai suoi figli migliori. Tutto il mondo civile stenta credere che si possa in questo nostro contesto storico a mettere l'esistenza di geni del male. A ricordarcelo l'impresa di Braivic che ha trovato il impreparata una società avanzata che aveva superato certe ipotesi aberranti che pur evidentemente sopravvivono e a volte si palesano senza che si possano prevedere. Il male esiste. Non c'è forza democratica che riesca a cancellare quanto l'incoltura e la violenza propongono, in profitando della civile tolleranza per tutte le opinioni. Di fronte al cedere di certe barriere erette e supportate dalla conoscenza della storia, le società Simentiscono nel panico quanto hanno ottenuto sul piano della convivenza civile. Questo non è successo in Norvegia, non una voce sbagliata, se levata a dimostrare il panico per una sconfitta come è stata quella della strage dell'Isola d'Iutoio. In altri possiti, chissà quanti avrebbero urlato invocando in quel paese dove il massimo della pena possibile per i diritti più efferati sono 21 anni la pena di morte. La Norvegia non ha perso pur né dolore la sua fermezza, e la sua civiltà ideologica. Nessuno ha chiesto di fornire armi alla polizia che continua a girare disarmate. Il mostro Bravik ha procurato un immezzo dolore ma la sua perversione è stata sconfitta dalla forza morale di un Paese esemplare unito nella tragedia convinto delle regole di una civiltà offesa ma non vinta. Il mostro non rappresenta se non un caso limite, non è capofilla di alcun movimento, è uno dei i valori figli dell'incultura e dell'idiozia che solo nella violenza riescono a risprimersi. Solo qualche sconsiderato ha approfittato della tragedia per far sentire la propria aberrazione culturale. Un grottesco politico europeo ha tentato un'incredibile difesa ideologica di questa strage spaventosa. L'idiozia è un altro aspetto della monstruosità, ma anche questa volta la rozezza e l'incultura sono state messi a tacere perché la visione di quelle facce pulite cancellate dalla furia del male non possa venire disturbata da voci distorte e bestiali.","How many of you have been killed after the murder in the island of Utoia? They didn't know at first that the body therapy was without life, they even recovered 76. For the most guys, who are clean faces, today we see on a site and on newspapers the faces of young people who will not see their dreams come true, which are then the dreams of many, of the best of those who believe in the values ​​that the bestiality of a monster has tried to cancel. When these events The Nordic countries cry for their best children. in the past. The people of the country are not only disbanding, but also making up for the crimes they have committed in the civil society. This has not happened in Norway. Not a wrong voice, but it has been shown that the panic for a conflict was the one of the island of Tøya. In other places, who knows how many would have cried when they were in the country where the maximum possible pain for the most injured rights was just death. Norway has not lost its firmness, and its ideological civility. No one has asked to supply weapons to the police, which continues to turn disarmament. The Brajvik monster has sought immense pain, but its perversion has been defeated by the moral strength of a country and exemplary, united in the tragedy, convinced of the rules of an offensive civility, but not defeated. The monster does not represent, if not a limited case, it is not a capofila of any movement. The children of the culture and the diocese who are in violence can only express themselves. Only a few have taken advantage of the tragedy to make them feel their own cultural aberration. A European political grotesque has attempted an incredible ideological defense of this dangerous line. The diocese is another aspect of the monstrosity. But this time the anger and the inculcure have been put to the brink. Because the vision of those clean faces, cancelled from the furia del male, I can't be disturbed by disturbing voices and beasts."

Wayne Jake has held on to his back and he was like, try to laugh at being serious. Jake, get off man, don't mess about, you know. So eventually he got across and he went, Lin, how did he do that man? Look how dirty that is. They raised £50,000, which is helping to build an orphanage in India as we speak. The walk was organised by faith and football, as religion plays a big part in Limbo's life. Not that it interested him as a kid, mind you. I was going to church as well on Sundays and believe me, church was the last place I wanted to be on Sundays. I just found it so boring. During a speech at Fratton Park last week for those thinking of turning to Christianity, he revealed that he nearly gave up football, when he was in contract negotiations with Reading seven years ago. You want your children to be healthy, strong, you want your marriage to be great. You get those things and it's like, well, we've got all this now what? At about 28, I made a decision to go to church. And I went there and the church that I went to was so different from what I was used to. There's a lot of freedom. And for the first time I heard that had Jesus can change your life. Do you get stick from opposing team on the pitch? No, not from opposing team. From a couple of letters to every now and again, especially when I start speaking to one or two of the others about different things gone on, you know, I would get a little bit of stick then and they're like, what are you trying to convert in for and all that. And he's not alone. In the team now, there's seven players who are Christians and we meet together, we pray before games, you know, we meet up once a week and have, you know, studied the Bible, have prayer sessions, talk about life and there's even a Monday night, once a month, Pray Up Pompey meeting where the guys meet together, pray for the football club, so there's all sorts going on. Pray Up Pompey, I see you. But I think people will be surprised to hear there's players, you know, five or six, seven players heading off to have a play before a game. Yeah, that's it. And it is unusual. But, you know, we don't find it unusual. We believe that's the thing to do. And we don't pray for wins, by the way. You believe that's an offence? Yeah, yeah. The fans' prayers were answered at the start of the season as the team went top and didn't concede in their first five games. The defence has been outstanding. In no small part due to the understanding of the centre half pairing who have played together before many, many moons ago. What's it like playing alongside him now? But in the last couple of games, they've conceded and lost. He says his faith has helped him step up to every challenge he's had to face at the club and it helps put everything in perspective. I couldn't ask for anything else and that's helped me so much in the last few years of my life."" And they'll be doing another walk for charity as soon as this season's over. I often come back and think to myself if this is what I could do for the rest of my life I'd love to do it and I really believe that that's going to be a big part of my life when I finish football that I'll be going to different countries helping children.

Tu es la seule qui puisse réellement m'aider. Mais plutôt, vous disiez vrai, vous pouvez savourer votre victoire. Qu'est-ce que le mot victoire peut signifier quand ma fille souffre autant ? L'enfant que j'ai mis au monde, berçait dans mes bras, et restait là à me regarder, sans la moindre émotion, le moindre sentiment. Navré pour vous. Je suis tout autant pour vous. Ne soyez pas Navré. Je crois que tôt ou tard, tout s'arrangera. Maria se souviendra qui elle est. D'une façon ou d'une autre, la vie reprendra son cours. En effet, parce que je m'épanne. pour faire tout ce qui est dans mon pouvoir pour qu'il en soit assis. Pour rendre à Maria la vie qu'elle avait, avec tout ce qui s'y rattachait et tout ce qu'elle mettait. Commencez par son mari. Tu as envie de m'aider, n'est-ce pas ? Je veux dire, tu ne m'en veux pas d'avoir... d'avoir gâché ton mariage au moins ? Non, je ne t'en veux pas du tout, Maria. Ah, ça ne fait rien. C'est mon vrai nom, Maria. Et les personnes qui étaient là tout à l'heure sont toutes de ma famille. Oui, ce sont les torresses. Tu sais qui ils sont. Oui. Qu'est-ce que tu sais d'autre à mon sujet ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ? J'ai la nette impression que tout le monde me cache une chose capitale à propos de moi-même alors je te le demande. Dis-moi ce que c'est. Allez, dis-moi franchement qui je suis en réalité pour tous ces gens. Tu devrais t'adresser au Dr Estrada. Elle est convaincue que la vérité serait trop difficile mais à la tort.

Tu n'as pas oublié que tu étais complètement anéantie. Ben ! Personne ne savait s'il allait pouvoir réussir à survivre à cette mort. Nous n'arrêtions pas de prier. J'ai toujours su qu'elle était vivante. Nous avons tous ressenti à chagrin immense. Mais aujourd'hui, aujourd'hui c'est fini parce que Maria a survécu lorsqu'elle a chaviré de ton bateau, Ben. Tu n'as pas oublié que tu étais complètement anéantie. Ben ! Tu vas enfin pouvoir retrouver ton grand amour. Pas un mot de plus, Annie. Ça suffit. Ben... J'ai dit pas un mot de plus. Tu as entendu ? Mais enfin, Ben, après toutes ces années de souffrance et de malheur, tu vas pouvoir retrouver Maria et les vivantes. J'imagine que vous n'avez qu'une envie, revivre ensemble. C'est une situation qui est très compliquée et à laquelle tu risques de ne rien comprendre. Alors explique-moi ce qui se passe. Maria, il faut que tu me laisses, que tu me laisses un peu de temps. Maintenant qu'on en est arrivés là, il faut te souvenir de ta famille. des gens qui ont pu être importants pour toi. Mais Ben ? Oui, Maria parle-moi. Lui aussi, il me connaissait auparavant, mais il refuse de me dire la vérité. Mais à la seconde, où il... il m'a effleuré la main, j'ai senti qu'il y avait eu une forte relation entre nous. Je l'ai ressentitée qu'on s'est touchés. Nous étions... nous étions traillés. C'est lui qui me l'a dit. Je sais que nous étions très liés. C'est vrai, Meg. Ben vient de devenir ton mari. Si quelqu'un doit m'expliquer ce qui se passe, je pense qu'il faut forcément que ce soit toi. Représenter pour moi.","But no one forces you, my dear. It only depends on you. Dana and my love... No, it's not Dana! Her name is Maria! Her name is Maria! I'll do everything I can to help her. It'll be fine. Oh God, thank God! You're the only one who can really help me. You could savour your victory. What can victory mean when my daughter suffers so much? The child I gave birth to in my arms and remained there to look at me without the slightest emotion, the slightest feeling. It's true for you. I'm just as much for you. Don't be a fool. I think sooner or later, everything will be fine. Maria will remember who she is. In a way or another, life will take its course. Indeed. Because I'm afraid of her. I want to do everything in my power to make her sit down. To make Maria the life she had, with everything that was attached to her, and everything she put in her time. Start with her husband. You want to help me, don't you? I mean... You don't want to have... to have ruined your marriage at least. No, I don't want to have anything, Maria. It's not that. It's my real name, Maria. And the people who were there earlier are all... of my family. Yes, they are the Thorens. You know who they are. Yes. What do you know about my subject? What do you mean? I have the impression that everyone hides something from me about me. But I ask you. Tell me what it is. Tell me who I am in reality for all these people. You should address Dr. Estrada. She is convinced that the truth would be too difficult, but she is right. The most important thing is that I always have someone who loves me and who really loves me. Someone like you, Meg. Maria, you don't understand what you're asking me. I know that after what I've gone through, nothing can be worse. All these people who have assisted in your marriage, it's obvious that they know things about me. So it's been a long time since I've discovered the truth around me. Stop, Maria, stop. You know the truth. You too, you know what others know about me. Yes, that's true. I'm aware of it. I'm sorry. You're still the husband of my daughter. Maria, you still love each other. You're really ugly for the other. You know that, Ben. I'm sure you'll live with her again. It's obvious. You're going to do it, Ben. Of course he knows. We all know who we are. All the people who knew Ben and Maria during their marriage, they were extremely loving. Stop it, it's enough! I have to say that because it's the strict truth. They were crazy about each other. It was awful. You didn't forget Ben. You didn't forget your chagrin. You didn't forget you were completely unwell. Ben! No one knew if he could survive this death. We didn't stop praying. I always knew she was alive. We all felt a huge chagrin. But today... Today it's over because Maria survived when she got rid of your boat, Ben. You're going to die. You'll finally be able to find your great love. Not a word more Annie, that's enough. I didn't say a word more, did you hear that? But Ben, after all these years of suffering and misfortune, you'll be able to find Maria and the living. I imagine you only have one desire, to live together again. It's a very complicated situation and at which you risk giving nothing. Then explain to me what's going on. Maria, you have to let me go. Let me go a little bit. Now that we've arrived here, you have to remember your father. friends, people who could be important to you. But... Ben? Yes, Maria, speak to me. He too knew me before, but he refused to tell me the truth. But at the second, when he... He flurred my hand, I felt that there was a strong relationship between us. I felt it again, we touched each other. We were... We were very close. He told me that. I know we were very close. It's true, Meg. Ben has just become your husband. If someone has to explain to me what's going on, I think it's necessary for you to represent me."

En Nox zit ongeveer standvol voor een van de vier sterke concepten die hier maandelijks plaat vinden. Vandaag is dat issues van DJ Mystique en DJ Chucky en DJ Rebel die gewoon hier een vette vette vette set spelen. DJ Chucky hier in Nox, Antwerp Lai. Brak! Welkom bij NoxTV. We dragen het maar eens eens issues tegengehaald. Ja gewoon, weet je, de foosjuis eigenlijk is een heel leuke zaal. Maar het is iets te klein. En daarmee heb ik een keer per maandhoek mijn eigen avond... ...in de Nordie DJ's uit. En dan, ja, ze hebben gewoon geleden de club op zijn kop. Het club DJ of het Holland eigenlijk... ...om een maand echt een topper te brengen. Ik denk wel als DJ, maar als producer vooral. We hebben Leibach Loop. We hebben vaten ook al zelfs al gehad. Nou is DJ'n shocky bezig. Hard welcome nog. Ik bedoel, Issues is het beste concept in België. Ik zeg het je, I promise you. Issues, de hoofd, de vogel van de... DJ Checki uit Nederland. Als je bent eigenlijk net uitgroebe tot het best Dutch Club DJ. Ja dat zeggen ze, maar ik wil het gewoon altijd naar mijn zin hebben in de club dus maak niet uit wat patiëters van krijgen welke namen krijgen. Ik wil gewoon altijd voor de mensen mijn ding kunnen doen en dat blijf ik ook doen. De poster staat, dirty house, eclectic, Latin beats. Wat moeten we daar eigenlijk allemaal over verstaan? Gewoon lekkere muziek met veel beats en veel muziek voor de vrouwen natuurlijk. Lekkere chicks dus eigenlijk. Zeker weten. Binnenkort is het kerst en nieuwe jaar. Wat zou jij graag onder je kerstboom terugvinden? Doe mij maar een bandlied. Goeie vraag, heel goeie vraag. Een heel vette buitenlandse boek in Ibiza ofzo. Een schijfde beste sfeer en het schoonste bood. Dit was Issues bij NoxTV. Tot de volgende keer.","Good evening, 5 December, the evening before the centric class. And Nox is about full of stances for one of the four strong concepts that are here on Monday. Today it's the DJ Mystique's issue. And DJ Chucky and DJ Rebel are just playing a cool, cool set. DJ Chucky here in Nox, Antwerp and Laaay. Welcome to NoxTV. We've just seen some issues, we've got them. You know, the foosy guy is actually a very nice guy. But it's a bit small. And I'm doing my own thing every month. And then the DJs come out. And then they just put the club on his head. The club DJ, or even Holland, really wants to bring a great band. I think as a DJ, but as a producer, especially. We have a live-action club. We also have a concert hall. Now DJs are shocky-faced. Hard welcome, guys. I mean, Issues is the best concept in Belgium. I promise you. Issues, the main goal of the... DJ Checki from the Netherlands. Hello Kus! How are you? Fine with you. It's going well. Did you find it easy to get away to a nox? We were a bit disappointed, but we finally got here. I thought you'd come with a stomp. With Sinterklaas. Yes, together with Sinterklaas, but it didn't work out. We got here with our own car. We got here with our own car. But we're finally here. The tent is full and I'm really excited. I have to congratulate you. You just turned out to be the best Dutch club DJ. They say that, but I just want to get it to my heart. But not from what titles I get, what names I get. I just want to be able to do things for the people and I will do that. This is the secret of DJ Chucky. What is your strongest chance? What I always do is a bit, or a bit. I always look very closely at what the audience wants. And then I try to make my own story. There is a lot of music for women and a lot of beats. Just a band song for me. Good question, very good question. A very cool foreign book in Ibiza or something. A very nice atmosphere and the most beautiful boat. This was Issues by NoxTV. Until next time."

Tak, możemy z pomocą widoczności aplikacji. Możemy założyć sobie application control policy. Muszę wyłączyć te proksy, bo on w tej chwili proksuje cały ruch, łącznie z ruchem do mojego Cisco ISA. Uruchamiamy jeszcze raz eksplorera. To akurat jest minus, że Cisco ISA administrowane jest poprawnie tylko przez eksplorera, np. z chrom nie działa. Wrazamy do apk ControlPolicyz. Wydaje się, że chcemy zablokować jakiekolwiek tunelowanie ruchu. Polityka bloku i tunelowanie musi zostać przypisane do jakiegoś interpejstwa. Nie ma możliwości wprowadzenia tego blokowa.

We will not see the URL that we have seen so far. For this proxy, our user will be able to freely go to any place in the network and our filtering of the URL is not worth much. Let's see if it works. Let's go to Google and see if the local location works. And now the local location works because our user has This is a hidden programming that works. Can we block it? Yes, we can. With the help of the application's visibility. To set the application control policy, I have to turn off the proxy, because it works all the time, including the move to my Cisco ISA. We are moving the explorer once again. This is the minus that Cisco ISA is administered correctly only through the explorer, for example from the network. We return to the application control policies. We put a policy in which we want to block any tunneling of the movement. We will try to install our smart program. The program will of course start, but it will not be able to connect any communication with the Proxy server. We are blocked here all the time. It is not in the table, and it will not be able to. The program is blocked here, and our Proxy function cannot be transferred outside."

I am here with Katie Forreston and Katie, you're looking forward to your performance? Yeah, I'm really excited. Can't wait. And I'm excited for everyone else. Yeah, I was just about to say the lineup is looking quite strong today. What are you thinking about this combination of acts together all up in the One Roof? I think it's great because not everyone just sits at home listening to one type of music. Everybody listens to all sorts of genres, especially in the that Sony Genres have fused together. So I think tonight we're representing all the urban sounds, so Long Beach, As, Electro. I'm looking forward to performing later because I'm bringing something a bit new tonight. I've been on a bit of a journey over the last couple of years trying to find my sound and I think tonight's going to be one of the first gigs I'll be doing which is bringing that to the table really. In the past I've been doing a lot of soul and jazz and working with loads of rappers whereas tonight it's more electronic sounding, a bit more up-tempo than what people might be used to hearing me. So it's just such a nice vibe having a night like this. They're all over London aren't they but the night Manchester. Finally is there any act in particular you're really looking forward to seeing? Do I just have to say one? It's not exciting it's all about good music. No no well I'll say daily then because I've never seen him live before but I am a fan of Shaka so I'll say daily just because I haven't seen him and I've been doing a little bit of YouTube stalking so yeah I can't wait to see him. It's gonna be a lot tonight it's definitely gonna be a lot. all about God music here today Sunday 31st July you're here with Darko, Katie Forrester signing out for now but we will have so much more in store a little later on."

A Melbourne and Deakin University report has shown. The joint report evaluated the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden program and confirmed the program has created positive health behaviour change in primary school children. What we found was that there was a clear increase in children's willingness to try new foods. We also found that there was an increase in children's level of enjoyment of cooking and an increase in their knowledge and confidence in their cooking and gardening skills. I like beans and I like cooking it in a cheese, chicken and rice. When you get rice and then you put all these vegetables in, like beans and carrots and broccoli and cook it. And it's really good. I never actually ate vegetables. I used to always eat junk food. So now I've learnt how to cook vegetables and it still tastes. The two-year study assessed over 700 children's change in attitude, behaviour and knowledge of food. Interviews with over 500 parents and 93 teachers were also conducted. The program has certainly exceeded our expectations in so far as student behaviour attitudes and also their engagement. It's amazing for children who require that little bit extra attention. The program allows the children to actually bring the garden back into the classroom and vice versa. So in terms of a maths program they can be talking about the maths involved in cultivation, growing, harvesting and also the maths that's involved in the cooking is quite extensive. It's really difficult to achieve change through health promotion programs that are meaningful and sustainable over time. What this shows is that this sort of program is an intense and ongoing program can achieve meaningful outcomes for children in terms of their appreciation of diverse healthy foods, for schools in terms of creating a very positive learning environment and for building connections between the schools and their local communities. cooking. Now you will find a beautiful dahl being made with tusk and kale and ginger and cabbage in the kitchen and a glorious leafy salad and I didn't see what else was happening but I saw bread rising in there and I think they were for chapatis. This is lovely, it's seasonal, it's wintry food, we are in Melbourne so they represent the community, the climate and seasonality. We also found that there was an indication that there was a transfer of the benefits to the home environment So that's pretty exciting given that that wasn't even the core focus of the program. I think the evaluation report is really important. We have strong anecdotal evidence that comes into the office every day. Whenever I visit a school I hear the same stories but we know that the government requires strong positive evidence that this program is delivering the outcomes that they say they want. Which is to develop healthier, long eating habits in young children. We believe that's what this program does and now we can show it. I like the kitchen garden program because it made me really healthy and it made me really, I loved vegetables but now I love them even more.","Primary school children have increased confidence in cooking and gardening as part of a kitchen garden program.

Même si on a eu le déçu sur l'ensemble des deux aux états de biais, il faut quand même le faire. C'est-à-dire que le système commence à s'implanter. Le système jour droit. 17 lancés seulement à une équipe qui devance les boutiques au transiment avant le match de ce soir. Comme demain, l'équipe qu'on va rencontrer devance les boutiques au transiment général. Et devant, encore plus, Gatineau qui est à démarquer ce soir 7 buts à Québec pas deux, 7. Moi je suis en commande pour l'équipe d'un clément à l'autre. d'autant plus qu'au moment où on se parle, on connaît pas l'alignement. On pourrait avoir, il faut avoir, imprévu, entre que minimum deux sur la liste des blessés. Loguil McMillan, qui était victime de clacage, mardi, quand tu te finis de jouer ce soir, ne je ne le ferai pas tout le fin de semaine. Et en troisième période, avant de me donner, on refonte le bat, seulement 10 joueurs, il y en manque un Olivier Fortier blessé. On ne connaît pas la nature de la blessure. On espère que ce n'est pas grand, mais au moment où on se parle, il est entre les mains. Ceci étant dit, l'Oceanic-Denémouski a contrôlé le match du début à la fin parce que l'Oceanic-Denémouski a joué 60 minutes sur 60. Bien sûr, il y a quelques attaques de l'adversaire. Mais quand l'adversaire limitait à 400 premières périodes, ça veut dire que l'on n'a pas eu beaucoup de temps de glace. Quand dans la deuxième période, il a fallu attendre une éternité avant d'avoir un tir au but de l'aventure de l'adversaire, ça veut dire que les muskis ont bien fait ses devoirs. C'est sûr qu'à trois à un à la vétière minutes de jeu, On a voulu faire ça un peu plus gentil. Un peu plus cuté, mais un peu plus au loin. On a voulu jouer finesse. Et là, ça l'a ouvert un peu jeux. Tu as amené cette erreur de Marc-André Bourdon. Qu'a-t-il coûté le deuxième but? Mets-tu du pote ou vas-tu lui marier à perdre le tour? Il est parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, il a été parti pour le premier coup, Il a fait les arrêqués en tout temps. Il a beaucoup de lancé. C'est pas une langue contre la qualité. Les arrêqués, il les a fait. Les loups, patrice 1er, il a forté le son 16ème match dans l'Uniforme de l'Occénie où il y a le son 16ème. Leucaconte. Leucaconte. Je pense qu'il est pas là. Bon, on va le venir avant le gars. Il produit, puis le Clément lui dit à la fin de la match, s'il lancé, puis je pense qu'il va le faire. Et naturellement, Marc-Landry pour le temps. Marc-Landry pour le temps, tout ça. C'est un but. à la prochaine, vous ne reviendrez pas ici. Et demain, gatineau, 7-4 à Québec, à Québec, salut! 8e victoire de suite de gatineau. Vous avez un affaire de la commande est sérieuse et on ne connaît pas tout à fait notre aliment. On va s'organiser pour y aller d'autant plus que vous avez pu se voir qu'à peu près tous les sièges ont vendu. On va donc avoir une superbe belle existence pour tirer nos à leur dernière partie locale avant un fin de semaine prochain. pour changer de quoi, pour l'intégrité. Toi, j'ai eu ma stationnalité à la jante couture, au fait, j'ai des mits.","The goal is to limit the opponent to only 17 throws. Even if we have the disappointment on the whole, we still have to do it. The system starts to implant. The system is on the right. Only 17 throws is a team that is in front of the coach before the match tonight. Tomorrow, the team we will meet in front of the coach in general. And in front of us, Gatineau, who was scored tonight, 7 goals. Don't worry, 2 goals, 7 goals. We don't know the line. We could have had to have a preview of at least two on the list of injuries. Logan Mcmellon, who was a claquage victim on Tuesday when he finished playing this evening, won't be able to play for the weekend. And in the third period, before giving me, we will go back to the bench. Only 19 players, there is one left, Olivier Fortier injured. We don't know the nature of the injury. We expect it's not great at the moment where we are talking about the injuries. This is why the Ossianis of the Muscovites controlled the match at the beginning of the game because the Ossianis of the Muscovites played 60 minutes on 60 goals. Of course there are some attacks from the opponent, but when the opponent limited to 400 first periods, that means that they did not have much time to play. When in the second period they had to wait for an eternity before having a shot at the goal, in relation to the opponent, that means that the Muscovites did well, it's to see. We wanted to do it a little more yellowish, a little more cute, we wanted to go with finesse. And then it opened a little game, which brought this fear of Marc-André Bourdon, who cost the second goal, but on the podium, you can be sure that nothing will lose. Speaking of the podium, it was only his first start in the oceanic form, very successful. The two start on the road. You have to remember that the two start in season with a far away against Saint-Jacques. He was a 6 to 1 saint, and he was 6 to 1 extra. Tonight, we felt like he was a master. He was confident. It was a good challenge to maintain the victory of the Oetian. Of the Bar and other Bar. To react to the 4,000 people who saw him for the first time after having heard all kinds of things about him. Some of them didn't have a style, or a style of the Bois-Talent, or some of them were a bit too much to Dominique Acherk, etc. So he was at home in the situation. He made the arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of arrequises in a very long time. He made a lot of ar It's a goal. If you have the opportunity to see again, Sebastien Couché, full-fledged, in his zone, two against one, the opponent, led the round to the Mourdon, who is going to play for the goal of the victory. All beauty. Couché, we have a lot of details in the last matches. I must go inside to see if you can see, there are two passes. So go to the Oceani 3-2 on the English Dark City, that we will return to Saint-Jean in a week, We will see you next week, we will come back here. Tomorrow, Gatineau, 7th card to Quebec, to Quebec, 7th card, 8th card of Gatineau, I will give you an order of the serious command and we do not know you, you are called the leader. We will be able to be there for a while, what I have to say tonight, that at about all the seats are sold out. We will therefore have a great resistance to Ténault at their last local party before the next week. I'm going to change the world, what I'm going to do. I'm going to change the world, what I'm going to do. I'm going to change the world, what I'm going to do. I'm going to change the world, what I'm going to do.

Solo volvió a la titularidad y jugó los cinco partidos de los Fuegos Olímpicos de Beijing 2008, que le dieron la medalla de oro al equipo estadounidense y en los que solo encajó solo tres goles. Todo parecía ir viento en popa cuando las lesiones hicieron presentes. La temporada 2010 terminó en el quirófano y su hombro derecho lesionado. Este año la recuperación física y anímica llegó en el Magic Jack y con una espléndida participación en el Mundial de Alemania, que ha batido récord de audiencia y atención mundial. en los cuartos de final enfrentaron nuevamente a brasil y los fantasmas volvieron al vestuario hubo penales y solo no defraudó se mantuvo fuerte y seguro bajo los palos y estados unidos pasó a semifinales donde venció a francia llegó la final contra japon y esta vez los penales no fueron superados una sensación de impotencia invadía a una hope solo inconsolable que subía triste a regoher su ansiado balón de bronce rara vez conseguido por un portero y sus guantes de oro galardo aunque se entregaba por primera vez en un campeonate de semejante índole. Solo está triste, pero no sola. Puede presumir de ser la mejor portera del mundo y de alguien que fue bautizada con el nombre de esperanza, lo que sí podemos esperar desde luego es una esperanzadora carrera.","While the Japanese went through the middle of the field to hug his goalkeeper Ayumi Kaigroghi, true heroine in a critical penalty and protagonist to give the title of champion to the country of the newborn, the goalkeeper of the beat team, Hope Solo, ran towards the stands to look for the console of his family and sink into a hug with his friends. If someone tore tears yesterday in the American team, that was alone, who did not manage to think about everything that happened in the last years. The Pal Beach, where they also fight Abbey One Badge and other five more selected, meets the next July 30th. Many of their idol groups have lived this veteran of the ball, Oriunda de Richland, in Washington, and daughter of a veteran of Vietnam of Italian origin. Only he began his football career as a model in secondary school, where he scored goals without stopping and achieved state titles. At the university he placed himself at last under the sticks, where he stood out, taking out balls outside the goal. and where it was included in three occasions in the Onfer Estelar, the so-called All American of the non-professional circuit. It was hired by the Philadelphia Charge when there was a female league in the United States and when this disappeared due to bad management and lack of interest in the public, it traveled to Europe to play for a year in the Swedish League with the Gothenburg and another in France with the Olympique Lyonnais. The United States League restored and only returned to play in the Atlético San Luis and in the Aldanta Beach, where years before it would also play the Mexican Maribus. He regained confidence and joined the team. He only returned to the top and played the five games of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. They gave him the gold medal to the US team and in which he only scored three goals. Everything seemed to go well in Popa when the injuries were made. The 2010 season ended in the Kirofano and his right shoulder injured. This year the physical and anemic recovery arrived in the Magic Jack and with a splendid participation in the German World Cup. In the quarterfinals, they faced Brazil again and the ghosts came back to the dressing room. There were penalties and only one of them was not from Fraudó. He remained strong and safe under the sticks and the United States passed semifinals where he won to France. The final against Japan arrived and this time the penalties were not overcome. An impotence sensation invaded a hope only inconsolable, which was sad to take away his old bronze balloon, rarely obtained by a porter, and his gold gloves, a garland that was delivered for the first time in a champion of such an angle. Only she is sad but not alone. She can assume to be the best goalkeeper in the world and of someone who was baptized with the name of hope, what we can wait for from then on is a racing hope."

Con questa ricorrenza si vuole ricordare alle donne e gli uomini del III Milenio la grande manifestazione del 1917. Delle donne operae di San Pietroburgo scesa in piazza l'8 marzo perché del pane per i loro figli e il ritorno degli uomini dalla guerra. Ma anche le 129 donne, tra le quali molte bimbe di 12-13 anni, morte nell'incendio di una fabbrica di cottone a New York, dove le operai lavoravano 14 ore al giorno, inchiuse a chiave per timore di furti o di pause troppo lunghe. Il sacrificio di queste donne, molte delle quali per salvarsi se gettarono dal decimo piano, rinnova in ogni donne il desiderio di vedere riconosciuta la propria dignità e il diritto ad una vita di quali la. di nuoro. Oggi è la festa della donna. In realtà io non ho mai amato la festa delle donne perché il simbolo della nostra debolezza, anzi vi assicuro che sarei molto felice se un giorno potessi festeggiare la festa degli uomini non ce l'ho contro di loro ma vorrei dimostrare che la donna è capace di stare veramente nei posti più importanti, occupati sempre da loro, dagli uomini e così significerebbe che abbiamo raggiunto i nostri diritti e la parità nei loro confronti. Inoltre io sono un insegnante e come tale mi voglio rivolgere alle colleghe insegnanti. Care colleghe, guardate, io lo so, noi non siamo adatte a fare il bungabunga e neanche lo vogliamo fare. Noi vogliamo educare perché siamo educati e siamo i due catrici della scuola pubblica statale. Vi invito, pertanto, ad opporvi a reagire con forza alle parole offensive che il nostro Presidente del Consiglio, anzi il Presidente del Consiglio, ha rivolto alla scuola pubblica statale. un saluto a tutti da lala e le parti della gilve degli segnanti di Bari. In occasione della ricorrenza dell'8 marzo vogliamo far trungere a chi è in ascolto il nostro saluto e i nostri auguri. Auguri alle bimbe affinché possano crescere sicure, sane e serene. Auguri alle ragazze affinché possano acquisire consapevolezza di se stessa delle proprie possibilità e della propria naturale forza. Auguri alle mie colleghe insegnanti che le sostengono nel difficile cammino che porterà a queste giovani a diventare delle cittadine della Repubblica Italiana. auguri a tutte le donne che ogni giorno, con senso di responsabilità, si impegnano nei loro compiti e nel loro lavoro. E infine auguri agli uomini che rispettano le donne, perché solo insieme a loro possiamo tutti sperare in un futuro migliore. Arrivederci.","Today, on 8 March 2011, a inauguration of all women was the Socialist Congress of the Co-Penagans workers in 1910 who decided to dedicate a party to women. With this recurrence, it is wanted to remember the women and men of the Third Millennial, the great manifestation of 1917. Of the women and workers of St. Petersburg, the 8 March was chosen to ask for bread for their children and return from the men of war. of the 12-13-year-old women who died in the fire of a cotton factory in New York, where the workers worked 14 hours a day, locked in the key for hours of rest or too long breaks. The sacrifice of these women, many of whom to save themselves if thrown from the tenth floor, renewed in each woman the desire to see recognized the dignity and the right to a life of which it is. Today the women's party is a symbol of our weakness. I assure you that you will be very happy if one day you can celebrate the man's party against them. I would like to show you that women are capable of being in the right places and we would have achieved our rights and equality in their confrontations. Moreover, I am a teacher and as such I want to talk to my teachers and colleagues. Dear colleagues, I know we are not good at making fun of each other and we don't want to do it either. We want to educate them because we are educated. We are the four of the State Public School. I invite you to react with strength to the offensive words that our President of the Council, indeed the President of the Council, has brought to the State Public School. Women who don't find work, educated women, women who are licensed, women who have a role in society, women who are marginalized, women who are violent, women who are fragile but insatiable, women who want their party to be held every day. We want to make our health and our needs grow. We want to make babies grow healthy and healthy. We want to make girls grow so that they can be aware of themselves, of their own possibilities and their own natural strength. We want to make my colleagues teachers who support them in the difficult path that these young people will take to become citizens of the Italian Republic. I wish all women who, every day, with the sense of responsibility, are committed to their competions and their work. And finally, I wish all men who respect women, because together with them we can all hope for a better future. Goodbye."

I'm just trying to get them to leave. I'm going to call my husband and say, you know this fat guy, Alfredo Benavidez? Have you talked to him? Have you been with him? Have you been with him? If he tells me not to call him, I'll be in trouble. You believe him? I was in the city of Barranco. That's hard. I've been to the city to sing. You've been with some guys. I don't care about that. I want to feel good. But you're not going to make me live the impossible. When I'm leaving, he'll be fine. He's been my father for years. After you heard about the record, the fact that you're fine doesn't mean you're just lying. No, but... You're telling the truth. You're telling the truth. You're telling the truth. I don't like it. Stupid. What? You see? You're going to say he's my son. You're blaming me. I'm your son! You're going to say you're my son. I didn't say you're a bastard. What did you say? You're not a girlfriend. You're a f-----. You'll have another taste, but don't mess with my family. I'm not a f-----. I'm going to have a fight with Luisito. You're a f-----. I'm going to be playing. No! Don't cry, you're going to be excited. Don't make her cry. I didn't say anything. You didn't say anything. You didn't see her crying. That's stupid. Why are you crying? Stop it. I don't want to make a face. What are you going to do? I'm going to go up this hill. What are you doing? You're going to talk to her. I didn't say anything. You said it. You don't know if the other guy is the same as you. They've been in Barranco's suite. I don't want to see him sing. I'm going to break his guitar. I'm going to break it. No, you're crazy. What happened? My f----- up Gordo. He keeps telling me to do it. The other idiot from Yamphool says they've been in Barranco's suite with some legs. You're a f----- up, Gordo. I don't care about him. You worry about what you've told me. What have I told you? You tell me who Luisito is. No, no. You tell me. I don't know who you are. I don't know who Luisito is either. Why do you have to get into my husband's? Why do you have to tell me I'm gay? I didn't tell you you're gay, you idiot! I didn't tell you. I'm telling you right now. I heard you, but I'm not. I wanted to be in front of you. You know what, I'm fat? I told you I don't want to be a coward. I said it on the table. You're single. I said it on the table. Alfredo, I don't see you as a nine-year-old. Some people change their tastes. I'm a whore. I'm not a whore. You're a whore. You're not mine. Oh, my God. Calm down. You're a whore. You're not going to get into my couple. You're crazy. I'm not here to defend myself. I'm here to protect myself. Imagine if you were here. Get the f---- out of here. I'm not here to defend myself. I don't understand. When we're done... Okay, okay. Stop. Stop, please. You're making me angry. You're making me angry. I don't care. I'm going to be deaf. I'm sorry, but I'm going to destroy this fat bitch. You'll see later. He's trying to get us to the discord and get us to get angry. The other guy was going. Yes, of course. But the other guy also made a mistake. He shouldn't have. Of course, but the girl wanted to cry. The girl's going to make him cry. She's fine. He's a real man. He can do anything. He can do anything.

He says yes because they've been in the... Look at him. Why are you fighting? You're not a kid. You don't know what you have on your side. Why do you get angry? I don't get angry. He doesn't throw the dardo in front of you. I'm not a cook. I'm just a cook. The maricones, they keep their things. The reindeers, the geysers throw them away. He has to say something that makes him happy, but it's always the case. With me, you can't get in. I get up at night and I take my scissors. I take my machine and I go to work. I'm serious. I don't want to do this. I can't do it. I'm going to do it! Now if I say it, do you remember I said I'm going to avenge someone? It's over, because now I'm going to ask your aunt to cut this damn piece of shit. I'm going to cut it and I'm going to do it. You have to be careful, I'm going to get it. Alfredo?

It's crazy because when I first met Debbie she was a little bit timid, not really sure how it was going to work out, you know, working with a trainer and such, but we just clicked like right away. We became buddies right away and the results just started just started happening like crazy. What made you come to me as a better fit? Well, one of the girls here I would see her and I saw she was losing weight and I was talking to her and I wanted to start working out in the gym but just didn't have the time or wanted to make the time and do it myself not knowing exactly what to work on and what to do. So it was easier to have a trainer here and way. Awesome. Awesome. So just having that accountability, having someone there to kind of coach you and show you what to do really well. Yeah. And the meal plans, you know, they're fantastic. Oh yeah. The food is good. You don't skim off food. You eat like five, six times a day. I mean, they're not little tiny eating videos either, you know, but you eat a lot of food. So you're not hungry at all. Awesome. So if you were to say the number one thing that that kept you from working out before like would you say it was like a lack of motivation or like what exactly was it? Yeah lack of motivation. Just doing it myself. It's hard to just motivate yourself to go do something when you're like oh I'm too tired you know but it off maybe I'll do it maybe I'll do it it you never get around to it. Where this way you have somebody that you have a certain time you go see them and you work out. So it makes it easier that way than trying to do it on your own. Awesome, awesome. Okay, so how much how much weight did you lose so far? I've lost almost 15 pounds since the end. I just went out shopping and bought some more new clothes that fit. So awesome. It's great.

Not wanting to do anything. It's crazy because when I first met Debbie she was a little bit timid, not really sure how it was going to work out, you know, working with a trainer and such, but we just clicked like right away. We became buddies right away and the results just started just started happening like crazy. What made you come to me as a better fit? Well, one of the girls here I would see her and I saw she was losing weight and I was talking to her and I wanted to start working out in the gym but just didn't have the time or wanted to make the time and do it myself not knowing exactly what to work on and what to do. So it was easier to have a trainer here and So just having that accountability, having someone there to kind of coach you and show you what to do really well. And the meal plans, you know, they're fantastic. The food is good. You don't skim off food, you eat like five, six times a day. I mean, they're not little tiny eating videos either, you know, but you eat a lot of food. So you're not hungry at all. Awesome. So if you were to say the number one thing that that kept you from working out before like would you say it was like a lack of motivation or like what exactly was it? Yeah lack of motivation. Just doing it myself. It's hard to just motivate yourself to go do something when you're like oh I'm too tired you know putting it off. Maybe I'll do it. Maybe I'll do it. it, you never get around to it. Where this way you have somebody that you have a certain time you go see them and you work out. So it makes it easier that way than trying to do it on your own. Awesome, awesome. Okay, so how much weight did you lose so far? I've lost almost 15 pounds since the end. I just went out shopping and bought some more new clothes that fit. So awesome. It's great. Awesome, awesome, awesome. And how's your energy now now that they know why I I don't lay around on the weekends anymore I am always up to do and everything Remodeled with my house and just happened at night. Okay. Okay. We're back. All right So now I bet you're wondering. Okay. They're showing me all their client testimonials They're talking about motivating me and coaching me and doing all these great stuff How much is this going to cost? It's a very good question and the answer to that question is Absolutely nothing it will cost you zip zero not a single dime We don't want nothing from you all we want you to do is tell everybody and I do mean everybody about this more than fitness journey We want everybody to get to the best shape of their life. There's no screens attached We're not going to upsell you on anything. No, and so without further ado the outline, okay?

I'm sorry, Koyce, because a big world is coming. If there was such a final, the battle under Grunwald was a war and a mazur, today a flower like a rose will bloom. Exactly, that's what we're talking about. I was in Grunwald's hut, there was a crack, a crack, and it should have been there long ago. We are happy that the law is coming. We have prepared a number of petitions that we would like to read now, using the fact that the TV is not only in Poland. We people... We people... No, you don't understand that, that's us. We apologize and ask for an apology for 2014. We promise that 2014 will never happen again. So we are ready to help Godme Dumst. Thank you. Thank you. Mister, we have one more request. I? To show the priest of St. John about the excommunication imposed on us, on the Kingdom of Poland, on the people's struggle for this armed act, because when I bring the IPN, it obliges us. Talk to the priest himself, tell him about you. But not as well as about you. These are important conversations. And there was almost no such thing at all in this battle? Yes, of course. It was there, right? The Great Pole was there. Wacław Szamot. Azawisza. Azawisza was black. What? A bad character. And now we would like to return the champion two-two-on-one swords. Yes, yes, yes. They say that the lords of the Zbieraczy, the Law of the Zlomiars, under the command of St. Edi. They could be in Sweden. Why Sweden? Because there was the Law of the Collectors of Iron Names from the Obozovs. But how can we do that now, Miszowicz? But we have two laws for that. He is a great man, he is a great man, etc. Of course. Well, ladies and gentlemen, agree, agree, and then you can give us your hand. We don't talk about the cross anymore. We talk about the Europeans. Yes, I am behind. Today the cross is the Europeans. That means, here the Euro is the Europeans, because we have to start. Thank you."

Abbiamo verificato che, nel termo del comparto dei servizi in abito sociale e sanitario, mancava una figura che potesse scuparsi nella quotidianità di aiutare tutte quelle persone che si trova comprovata un momento di risultato ai salvi, di persone anziane ma anche chi ha la difficoltà operabile di reperire i farmaci e soprattutto la documentazione sanitaria. Nalla quattro anni fa, da un'iniziativa sul personale, sul territorio, Oggi siamo presenti su 74, proprio quello che dico in cittadiana, presentiamo il famiglione 2 milioni d'italiani che si ricorgono noi proprio perché hanno delle coprovate difficoltà ad andare dal medico, a tirare la ricetta, andare al farmacì e acquistare il prodotto e portarsolo direttamente al farmacì. Di solito questa attività veniva fondamentalmente affidata al favoritismo del parente prossimo all'ambito familiare. Oggi noi siamo quella figura, siamo il parente e in un momento una vera risorsa, quindi riuscire ad aiutarli in questa trispazione diretta fondamentale. La presentiamo in un'Italia da Cechi sul territorio perché, su questo, abbiamo anche vissuto una fascia di persone risabili e siamo convenzionati al partnership della CIS, dell'FNP, per quanto riguarda tutta la parte pensionata, ma ne lo accorde anche con l'ordine dei con vari ordini professionali che magari erano dei nostri servizi e poco per questo di poter necessitare. Siamo considerati un vero e proprio welfare, un prelato, non solo servizi di natura documentale o farmaceutica ma anche tutti questi servizi come l'infermiera domicilio, l'assistenza domicileale, la replitazione, la fisoderapia privata ma apprezzati vicini a quello del pubblico con i tempi e la qualità del privato. Quando è che annola partirà il servizio? Annola è partirata come dicendo l'attività di consenere Carbito qui annola ha creduto che il nostro progetto è una società che si chiama pronto salute che si occupa di centralizzare la proprietà, che lo stiamo interessando, tra le rivolge, se andano a numero verde, che è 800, 57, 25, 25 per avere tutte le informazioni. del valore di 35 euro a famiglia, da quel momento, con le persone chiamando il numero verde, chiedono quello che fa bisogno, il nostro consulente si muove, va dal medico di famiglia, retira la documentazione sanitaria, si regga il farmacia, acquista il farmacio e riporta direttamente a 12 cilio del cittadino. Permettiamo a tutti i cittadini di non avere più la necessità di trovare il tempo nel dare dal medico, dire verso tra le normali attività da lavorare a dire, e soprattutto ricevono nel rispetto di quelle che sono le principali normative di riferimento, perché lavoriamo con la delega prescritto per il cittadino o in modo tale da tutelare anche la figura dei medici di base ne ha la consenua a persone diversa dall'intensità, gestiamo tutto con l'obligezione della privacy perché la documentazione sanitaria è comunque documentazione sensibile per la privacy, lì per la scelta della fabbricieda parte del cittadino e in modo tale del non veicolare al corpico commerciale di altra nature. ci sono quelle delle convenzioni in atto? di riferimento per dare sempre più da dovenzione di servizi ai cipri. di carattere sociale, di carattere sociale, non sanitaria e poi sicuramente un servizio a fondo delle altre fasce di persone. Al solito l'Italia, in particolare, siamo già presenti a Napoli, a Pozzoli, ad Alersa, a Caserta e a Salerno, quindi adesso avremo anche qui al Nolo, quindi una conoscertura quasi totale del territorio e quindi ci aspettiamo di grossi seguiti totali come abbiamo fatto anche in altri ari.","The project was based on the satisfaction of the need. We identified that in the form of the service department in a social and health environment, a figure could be missing in the daily life of helping all those who are in the process of getting a job, who are old people, who have the difficulty to repair the farms and especially the health documentation. Four years ago, a personal initiative on the territory Today we are present on 74 of the Italian community, we present the family of two million Italians who are in our way, because they have the difficulty to go to the doctor, to remove the prescription, to the pharmacy, to buy the product and take it directly to the pharmacy. Usually this activity comes fundamentally devoted to the favoritism of the relative family. Today we are that figure, we are the relative family. and the next one is always available to satisfy the needs of the Italian family. Another one is the satisfaction of all those who are in trouble, especially the disabled, of the people with the problems they have. But I think it is good to know that the problem is constant, for everyone, and that of the lack of time. So we are also told to a public, an important one, also the lawyers, the lawyers, and the professional group, We have a lot of resources to help you in this important and significant satisfaction. We present it to you in Italy and in the Czech Republic, because we believe that you are also a part of the people of the Sabin. We are a partnership of the CSDFNP, which is related to all the affected parts, but we also agree with the professional organizations that were our services and for this reason we need them. We are considered a real well-fired, The research is carried out by Dr. Lina Sontorrentino, who is our reference map, where the research will be centralized. The research will be in the green number 850, 57, 25, 25, to get all the information. What is the service of the farm and the home? The cost of the family is 35€. The person who calls the green number, the person who needs it, the consultant moves to the family doctor, he retires the health documentation, he gets the pharmacy, he buys the drugs, he takes us to the hospital. We allow all the citizens, where the need to find the time to go to the doctor, to go to the doctor, to the normal activities they are working on, and above all to the general public, The main requirements are the regulations, because we work with the delegate written for the citizen, in order to ensure that the figure of the basic doctors gives us a different person from the others. We manage everything with the private documentation, because the sanitary documentation is still in the sensitive documentation for the private ones. There is the choice of the famous part of the citizen in order to avoid commercial agreements of other nature. We have to do it again at the evening of the 21st or because we need to repair the house of the family, therefore in the rare opening of the medical centers and the opening of the pharmacies and the withdrawal of the documentation for the pharmacies. There are those conventions in action? Yes, we have local conventions from the Lottico Palace to the hermaphrodisiacal services, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, we have a coordination and starting from the Why did this service happen in the Campania region? and also social characteristics, not healthy, and then surely a service in the form of other aspects of people. In Italy we are already present in the country, in Naples, in Pozzoli, in Alersa, in Caserta and in Salerno, so now we will have almost a total coverage of the territory here in the Netherlands, and therefore we expect such results as we have also done in other areas."

And from the child of what fucking goomba, so immediately the game starts. Okay, this time it will work. I died again. Fuck, Mukhumor. I can't die. Yes. I remember. It's very difficult. I've already played a lot of games on my feet. And what are they here? I? No. I will jump over the skull of my father. Chaknoris is weak. Two goons are different. Chaknoris is in the same boat as weak. He can't do two mushrooms at the same time. And I can. Yes. Two little eyes are smiling. Almost passed the level. The end of the rubble is a terrible thing. 19,300 points. That's cool. So here's the level. And here's Maria cleaning the rubble. Oh, well, well. You don't even need a Vasily. And you noticed, Maria Karolik. Well, I just ate a mushroom. But it was two pounds different. I can't play normal. Maria, don't you have a headache? Shut up, you moron! You're a fool! You're a moron! Sorry for the splash of emotions. Maria, do you know that? How the fuck are you? You jump so high and you're fucked up. Eh. We take it again, take it and grow them like a book. Okay, let's go fuck the evil with the legs, not Maria, not with the head, don't think about it. Hold the head. Yeah, Mario, we have a dream. How do I get to the end of the world? Oh no, sorry, this is a magic boom and a skull. Oh yes, I completely forgot. Long time ago, as a developer, it was hard to make a work. A skull and a boom? Is that all? Well, I forgot. There are more guns. about rhinos, but damn, why aren't they at the beginning? While we were discussing the mob, I was tired of spending my life with glasses, but how could I have been so smooth?

Así que, tras que no estamos trabajando, también estamos sometidos a la sola inseguridad que hay en todos lados. No hay respuestas en el municipio, no se acerca a nadie a decirnos nada. Y desde que vimos que la obra, más o menos en marzo, cuando la obra iba muy lento, empezamos a reunirnos porque no veíamos presencia municipal en la obra. y empezamos a exigirlo un poco al municipio que interceda, para ver los plazos de obra porque era muy lenta la obra. A partir de ahí, por ejemplo, conseguimos que el municipio se comprometiera, que todo el Consejo de Libererante votara a favor para sacar los impuestos municipales como una forma de acompañamiento. Los impuestos municipales hasta el día de hoy siguen llegando. Nosotros, esta semana cuando abrimos, encontramos en nuestras puertas todo lo que es impuesto. Yo lo que le pido al que le pido que le corresponda es que nosotros queremos acompañamiento real, que nosotros queremos que las cosas sean de hecho, no palabras, porque de palabras estamos cansados. No tenemos ni palabras ni hechos en este caso, porque información no tenemos, nadie se acerca de decirnos qué va a pasar y en lo concreto tampoco, porque los impuestos nos siguen llegando como siempre. que no se creía nada. Y quedó de venir a la semana a hablar de nuevo acá al frente del MJ, y nos vino, nos vino a dar la cara. Son políticos, parece que ganan bien ellos y para nosotros nadie se calienta. En alguna oportunidad lo dije, los comerciantes de Luján no están acostumbrados a los cortes y ese tipo de cosas. Nosotros nos levantamos todos los días, abrimos las presionas y salimos a trabajar. No le estamos pidiendo al Estado que nos dé ningún tipo de resarcimiento en lo que se refiere. tenemos. Lo que queremos es poder seguir trabajando. Si yo no facturo lo que venía facturando no es porque yo no me levante y venga a trabajar. Es porque el Estado me cortó la calle principal que es la que me permite el acceso a mis clientes. Entonces lo que necesitamos es que el Estado responda de alguna manera. Estamos viendo la posibilidad de presentar un amparo, estamos buscando a alguien que tenga peso, alguien que sea reconocido y hacerlo en el conjunto de todos los comerciantes, somos más de 120 comerciantes los que hay sobre la avenida. Aprovecho las cámaras para invitarlo al resto de los vecinos, le vamos a comunicar cuando viene este abogado, se acepta el caso, vamos a primero iniciar lo que se llamaría una demanda legal, que eso nos ampare para si bueno, llegar adelante alguna otra medida como el corte, tener antes un algo que nos ampare, porque mucha de la gente dice que nos pueden hacer algún tipo de demanda, entonces nosotros primero le reclamamos y tenemos algo sobre qué basarnos.","And they cut my hands off because four months ago they entered that they didn't work in the money, they had to pay the rent, the taxes, they had to pay everything. And everything is bad, we didn't work anything and we have to pay. In front of the Mijota station, in the service station, but a terrible mud, the trucks, trucks, cars, and that kills them, it kills them all. When the work just started, the merma was almost total, 80% had gone to sales. Today we have enabled a short break and the neighborhood, Buenos Aires, is packed, so you can breathe a little better. You have to recognize it, you see something of transit. But we are not as always. People continue to go here and the one who passes finds himself later with all that dirt, compost. We have to force them to continue because if they bend the trucks inside, they throw cables. No, you feel it, you keep feeling it a lot. We have no security. Yesterday, for example, we went to work with the business here in front of us, they had it packed at night, they opened it. So, after we are not working, we are also subjected to the insecurity that is everywhere. There are no answers in the municipality, no one approaches to tell us anything. And since we saw that the work, more or less in March, when the work was going very slow, we started to gather because we did not see the municipal presence in the We started to demand the municipality to give us a little bit of time to see the work because the work was very slow. From there, for example, we managed to get the municipality to commit to the entire Liberator Council to vote in favor of removing municipal taxes, as a form of accompaniment. The municipal taxes, until today, continue to arrive. This week, when we open, we find in our doors everything that is taxed. The reason he is responsible is that we want real support, that we want things to be done. Not words, because we are tired of words. We don't have any words or deeds in this case, because we don't have any information about what will happen. And not specifically, because taxes continue to arrive as always. The superintendent was here and I told him that when he was going to enable me, he said, tomorrow they start working, stay calm. And I told him, of course, the superintendent, We were asked to leave the state, and we were not bothered by any kind of resuscitation. We have to work hard. If I don't factor in what I was doing, it's not because I don't get up and come to work. It's because the State cut off the main street that allows me access to my clients. So what we need is that the State responds in some way. We are seeing the possibility of presenting an amparo, we are looking for someone who has weight, someone who has been recognized and do it in the whole of all the merchants, we are more than 120 merchants who are on the avenue. I take advantage of the cameras to to invite him to the rest of the neighbors. We will tell him when he sees this lawyer, he accepts the case. We will first start what would be called a legal lawsuit, which that will make us feel bad for if, well, if there is any other measure like the court, having something that will make us feel bad before. Because many people say that they can make us some kind of lawsuit. So we first claim it and we have something about what to base on."

This quarter of November we have formed a friendly way, all of us are a business association, not yet registered to take part in the road of Sicilian roads, which in recent times, already from one and a half, is a health degree. When you have practiced well, you are lucky. In what sense? We have the VED that has been cured for a long time, beautiful trees, but otherwise today there is a correct cure. Now, the people who park here, who have fallen to the ground, are going to drink. We have the fact that the PD Parkage, which we have penalized 100% since they have undergone the entry, which they have taken to make villettes, garages and parking lots, are not finished. We don't even know when this door will open, already two years ago, without even letting us understand, we are shopping, citizens, how many parking lots will be paid? There will be, because they have made 55 garages for maintenance, They say 28% because there is payment, but even those small ones, those 28%, you don't know when it opens or when it starts. We are always less isolated from the sex or the symptoms, but the next day we want them to understand us and how we have to do it."

And today we get to talk to you about content curation. Content curation is extremely important for businesses to be doing. It's one way to keep your finger on the pulse to know what's going on in your industry, but it's also a really great way to position yourself as an industry thought leader. So Kate, what is content curation? Content curation is the process of sorting through all the vast amounts of information out on the web and then presenting it in a meaningful and organized way around certain themes. So it's really sitting through, it's sorting, it's arranging and then publishing information that's relevant real time to your audience. Nice! It's a lot like a museum curator and because museum curators they identify themes, they figure out the context They decide which paintings they want to hang on the wall or what artifacts to put out, all based around a certain theme that their audience, the public, is going to come in and see. So curators' content curation is the same exact process. We want to find information that our audience is interested in, organize it for them, make it easy to process, and then put it out for our audience. audience to view. I mean that sounds great and a lot of information to sift through but why should businesses care about it though? Well businesses need to care because there's so much information going across social media every second and audiences have way too much clutter out there or noise like we like to call it to really find your brand or be engaging with you with all of the other information being out there. So what contact curation does is you start to form interests around certain topics and information that your audience is engaging with. You become the thought leader and then once you start to pull your audience in, all of a sudden you are now the go-to authority. And it's very informational for your audience to have the curated information and content for them on a daily basis so that they can really engage and understand your brand and interact with you. education for other people's education, how can you do that without going crazy because blog posts and things? Right, so because it has become so important and it is a big part of your inbound marketing strategy, there are now a lot of software tools out there that can help you and that's what we want to focus on today. We chose three that we really find useful. So let's begin there. We have the first is curation traffic and curation traffic is a WordPress based content curation platform and there's two versions. There's a theme version and then there's also a plug-in, but you can get the software to have both of those. It allows you to curate through just the push of a button so it's very easy to curate your information for your audience. and there's a lot of plug-in integrations for HootSuite, Pinterest, Bucker, Bitly, and other popular social sharing websites allowing you to engage and share your content with your audience. And then it's also designed to increase your conversions by allowing you to create niche focus calls to action. And this is very important because you want to have a purpose for what why you're doing this and why you're curating your information. And if our poll is obviously when you curate content, you want to convert that into a buyer, into a long lasting relationship for your brand. So curation traffic does a really great job doing it. It's a very easy platform to use. And you can find more information about curation traffic at curationtraffic.com. Another one that we like is Paper Lea. This is another content curation platform and it's different because it allows people to publish and curate information in a newspaper style approach based on topics that you like and then you're able to put out new fresh daily content. But it's kind of fun to do it in a newspaper style. And Paper Lee believes that people should be in control of curating their content based on their interests and what matters to the person most. So it's allowing brands to brand their newspaper for their audience. You can find more information at paper.ly. Another, the last one that we looked at is bundler.com.

Barbara Melanson, director of human resources of a public school district in Charlotte stated Whether you do it con consciously or subconsciously it determines who you promote if you're looking to get ahead You should look like you belong to be there All of us will be taking our spot within the workforce in the next five years and we need to to recognize what kind of attire will work for a healthy and productive environment. More importantly, we need to realize just how crucial it is that you look prepared for day one. I believe that attire is one of the most important aspects of work every day, as does Barryman Fink. When they state and use a study, it is a rare manager who does not realize how appearance affects credibility in the workplace. I have done a lot of research on this topic and my dad, who is the president of the Raskin Methodist College, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the most important and 10 being the least important, the attire of an employee is a 2 or 3. One thing to keep in mind is that once the employee is hired, their attire not only reflects upon them, but it reflects on the university as a whole. Today, my goal is to persuade you to change your belief about attire in the workplace. I will be sharing with you the potential problems that could come with not being appropriately dressed when you go to work and more specifically, what repercussions of you not being prepared on day one can be. The reputation you could earn if you don't dress conservatively enough and why it's important to be prepared even after your first day. Then I will share with you the solutions to these problems in order to show you how important it is that you take a tire in the workplace seriously. Now that we've briefly discussed my main points, I will start with the first one and talk about how many possible problems could occur as a result of your tire on day one. The first problem I'll be sharing with you today is the reputation you may get if you come unprepared into the workplace. Drawing the line between business casual and too casual is becoming increasingly harder for a lot of businesses and employees. USA Today shares that lab researcher Dan Gruhl usually shows up to work in flip-flops and a t-shirt. While in the definition of business casual for IBM, flip-flops and t-shirts are included, General Motors says that the following items are excluded from their list of business casual. Athletic shoes, jeans, take tops, sweatshirts, or t-shirts. Obviously the term business casual is confusing a lot of people. So let's take a minute to look at an example. You just landed your dream job at this place that you've all been your dreams since you were five years old and the dress code is business casual. So you walk in on your first day dressed in what you think business casual is. But what ends up happening is that you are dressed a lot less professional than everyone else in office. For example, your wearing a tank top when everyone else is wearing business jackets. And then, in case that is enough, you walk into a meeting where everyone on your floor is and they all see you dressed down and when they're all dressed up. And so, not only have they already formed an impression of you in their head where they don't really want you on their team or they think that you're not prepared to be working in this place, you then realize your manager tells you that you have to split up into different teams. And so, then what happens is no one really wants to be on your team because of the bad reputation you've already given yourself because of the clothes that you're wearing. So your reputation is really on the line here. And it's already hard coming into a team of experienced workers and trying to live up to the standards and expectations that they have for you. So not being dressed appropriately is really not going to help you out in this situation. While discussing the topic of too casual versus too professional, we should also address the consequences of not dressing conservatively enough. If you were to appear to work on this same day dressed not conservatively enough your peer opinions will not be very good about you. And so if you're a girl for example and you come dressed in a very low-cut dress and really tall heels a lot of people like women like other your peers that are women may think that you're just trying to attract guys or they won't take you very seriously. And the guys that you work with will also not take you very seriously. because it's really hard for women to be taken seriously by men anyway and if you're dressed like you're not a business professional they're not going to consider you a business professional. So not only is your reputation on the line with those people that you work with but it's on the line with the people who you do business with, who you do business with, your clients. On salary.com news editor Regina Robo says, especially if you deal directly with customers the way you express yourself to the world is far more important than the true you. at least while you're on the job. And in the business world, most businesses thrive on their communication with customers and their clients. So if you can't present yourself in a way that shows clients that you're respectable and responsible, you will slowly start losing them. Now that we have discussed the problems that may occur if you're not wearing appropriate attire, we will discuss how to make sure that this never happens to you. My solution to the previous problems is that you need to be prepared and flexible. Being flexible, for example, is coming to work with an outfit like wearing a collared shirt under a jacket so that if you are thrown into a meeting where you don't need to be very professional, you don't need to be dressed like super professional, you can slip off your jacket and look like you belong with everyone else, but if you're thrown into a meeting where you need to be very professional, then you can keep your jacket on and again match everyone else. Also, being prepared for anything means that you've already survived your first day and it's within like your third month and you need to, you are going to give a speech at one o'clock, but you're at lunch at noon and you spill orange juice all over yourself or something like that. And so, you have to make sure that you have a backup plan, which includes in your closet work, you can have like an extra jacket or an extra pair of pants, even an extra pair of shoes in case a heel breaks or something like that, maybe an extra pair of pantyhose in case you get a run, which is a very common thing these days. And so, once you are paired, you have to be able to be flexible. with those outfits. So on days that you have big meetings you need to be able to plan that you should wear black pants so because you know that you have an extra black jacket in your closet at work.

In the solution to your problem it's always to be prepared and flexible. By presenting you with all of these scenarios and giving you possible solutions to these stereos, your belief about a tire in a workplace has hopefully changed. Using my solutions to the possible problems of not having the correct tire in the workplace, you are sure to be one of the ones who will be best dressed and fit for that motion in your future work environment. Thank you. It's said it.","Did you know that in a survey recently conducted by office team they found that 93% of executives admitted to a person's work attire being considered when they were considered for promotion? Barbara Melanson director of human resources of a public school district in Charlotte stated Whether you do it con consciously or subconsciously it determines who you promote if you're looking to get ahead You should look like you belong to be there All of us will be taking our spot within the workforce in the next five years and we need to to recognize what kind of attire will work for a healthy and productive environment. More importantly, we need to realize just how crucial it is that you look prepared for day one. I believe that attire is one of the most important aspects of work every day, as does Barryman Fink. When they state and use a study, it is a rare manager who does not realize how appearance affects credibility in the workplace. I have done a lot of research on this topic and my dad, who is the president of the Raskin Methodist College, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the most important and 10 being the least important, the attire of an employee is a 2 or 3. One thing to keep in mind is that once the employee is hired, their attire not only reflects upon them, but it reflects on the university as a whole. Today, my goal is to persuade you to change your belief about attire in the workplace. I will be sharing with you the potential problems that could come with not being appropriately dressed when you go to work and more specifically, what repercussions of you not being prepared on day one can be. The reputation you could earn if you don't dress conservatively enough and why it's important to be prepared even after your first day. Then I will share with you the solutions to these problems in order to show you how important it is that you take a tire in the workplace seriously. Now that we've briefly discussed my main points, I will start with the first one and talk about how many possible problems could occur as a result of your tire on day one. The first problem I'll be sharing with you today is the reputation you may get if you come unprepared into the workplace. Drawing the line between business casual and too casual is becoming increasingly harder for a lot of businesses and employees. USA Today shares that lab researcher Dan Gruhl usually shows up to work in flip-flops and a t-shirt. While in the definition of business casual for IBM, flip-flops and t-shirts are included, General Motors says that the following items are excluded from their list of business casual. Athletic shoes, jeans, take tops, sweatshirts, or Obviously the term business casual is confusing a lot of people. So let's take it to take a minute to look at an example. You just landed your dream job at this place that you've all been your dreams since you were five years old and the the address code is business casual. So you walk in on your first day dressed in what you think business casual is. But what ends up happening is that you are dressed a lot less professional than everyone else in office. For example, your wearing a tank top when everyone else is wearing business jackets. And then, in case that is enough, you walk into a meeting where everyone on your floor is and they all see you dressed down and when they're all dressed up. And so, not only have they already formed an impression of you in their head where they don't really want you on their team or they think that you're not prepared to be working in this place, you then realize your manager tells you that you have to split up into different teams. And so, then what happens is no one really wants to be on your team because of the bad reputation you've already given yourself because of the clothes that you're wearing. So your reputation is really on the line here. And it's already hard coming into a team of experienced workers and trying to live up to the standards and expectations that they have for you. So not being dressed appropriately is really not going to help you out in this situation. While discussing the topic of too casual versus too professional, we should also address the consequences of not dressing conservatively enough. If you were to appear to work on this same day dressed not conservatively enough your peer opinions will not be very good about you. And so if you're a girl for example and you come dressed in a very low-cut dress and really tall heels a lot of people like women like other your peers that are women may think that you're just trying to attract guys or they won't take you very seriously. And the guys that you work with will also not take you very seriously. because it's really hard for women to be taken seriously by men anyway and if you're dressed like you're not a business professional they're not going to consider you a business professional. So not only is your reputation on the line with those people that you work with but it's on the line with the people who you do business with, who you do business with, your clients. On salary.com news editor Regina Robo says, especially if you deal directly with customers the way you express yourself to the world is far more important than the true you. at least while you're on the job. And in the business world, most businesses thrive on their communication with customers and their clients. So if you can't present yourself in a way that shows clients that you're respectable and responsible, you will slowly start losing them. Now that we have discussed the problems that may occur if you're not dressed, if you're not wearing appropriate attire, we will discuss how to make sure that this never happens to you. My solution to the previous problems is that you need to be prepared and flexible. Being flexible, for example, is coming to work with an outfit like wearing a collared shirt under a jacket so that if you are thrown into a meeting where you don't need to be very professional, you don't need to be dressed like super professional, you can slip off your jacket and look like you belong with everyone else. But if you're thrown into a meeting where you need to be very professional, then you can keep your jacket on and again match everyone else. Also, being prepared for anything means that you've already survived your first day and it's within like your third month and you need to, you are going to give a speech at one o'clock but you're at lunch at noon and you spill orange juice all over yourself or something like that. And so you have to make sure that you have a backup plan, which includes in your closet work, you can have like an extra jacket or an extra pair of pants, even an extra pair of shoes in case a heel breaks or something like that, maybe an extra pair of pantyhose in case you get a run, which is a very common thing these days. And so once you are paired, you have to be able to be flexible with those outfits so on days that you have big meetings you need to be able to plan that you should wear black pants so because you know that you have an extra black jacket in your closet at work. You now have the information you need that will lead you to having the tools in the workplace in order to present yourself successfully. In conclusion I will give you a little review on the problem of attire in the workplace. There is not being not having not wearing the correct attire with your reputation on the line and also the opinions that your peers may form about you if you aren't dressed conservatively enough. In the solution to your problem it's always to be prepared and flexible. By presenting you with all of these scenarios and giving you possible solutions to these scenarios, your belief about a tire in a workplace has hopefully changed. Using my solutions to the possible problems of not having the correct tire in the workplace, you are sure to be one of the ones who will be best dressed and fit for that motion in your future work environment.

I får noget ud af det her, tror jeg. Hvorfor synes du, at de unge studerende skal tilmeldes af denne her Come Case Competition-komperanse? Jeg tror, det kan gå hen og blive et par rigtig gode og formidable dage, hvis man er kommunikationsstudierende på kandidatniveau i Danmark. Det første gang, vi laver det overhovedet, jeg synes det er jo godt at være med i sådan en pioneringsinsats. Og så tror jeg også godt, vi kan gå hen og opleve noget der på et visst internationalt niveau. Så at være med til det, det tror jeg bliver rigtig fedt. kommunikation og HR i Koldeplads på globalt niveau. Kommunikationsmiljøet i Danmark er stort og spændende. Vi har lyst til at gøre det lidt mere internationalt. Vi vil lyst til at lave den her konkurrence, hvor vi måske både over for os selv, for studierne, men også over forævervslivet demonstrere, hvor dygtig man er som kommunikator. Vi omsætter for cirka 8 milliarder danske kroner og vi er omkring 8.000 medarbejder. At simpelthen se demonstreret, hvor dygtige unge studerende er i dag på kandidaten Det tror jeg egentlig, altså mere tydeligt måske end normalt kan vi se det i praksis, fordi vi kan komme og se løsninger. Det er jo et offentligt tilgængeligt, så alle kan komme ind og ligge mærke til det. Hvad er det i virkeligheden, der sker, når kommunikation bliver praktisk? Det tror jeg, at vores kagesk giver mulighed for at teste af, og månække flere af dem for lettere at få et studiet job eller måske et rigtigt job bagefter. Så det er sådan butik, der virkelig, virkelig, virkelig er vokset over de seneste mange år. Hvad kan I så få ud af det? Vi stiller jo en case til rødighed. Vi får jo en masse idéer, som vi kan bruge i vores praksis. Jeg tror ikke, at vi tror, at den her casekompetition løser vores problem, men den bidrager til det og gør, at vi selv skal skære på slet. Strængtad er vi i hver eneste land i verden. Hvad er god moderne professionel kommunikation i en international kontekst? Det kan demonstrere for os alle sammen. Mer om det senere, når vi snakkes ved om den her case og vores lille kompetition.","I'm really happy to see you. You get something out of this, I think. Why do you think that the young students should participate in this competition? I think it can be a really good and formidable day if you are the communication students at the level in Denmark. The first time we do it, I think it's good to be part of such a pioneering effort. And I also think we can experience something at a certain international level. So being able to do that, I think it will be really cool. and the HR in the global area. The public transport in Denmark is very exciting. We want to make it more international. We want to make this competition where we demonstrate how rich we are as communicators. We are about 8 billion Danish crowns and we are about 8,000 employees. Simply see how rich the young students are today I think that's more clear than normal, we can see it in practice, because we can see solutions and it has been done publicly available, so everyone can come in and notice it. We were up to target the best. What is really happening when communication is practical? I think our case can give us the opportunity to test and not more of them can easily get a studious job or maybe a real job afterwards. So it's a shop that is really, really, really grown over the last few years. What can you do about it? We are still a case to the red. We get a lot of ideas that we can use in our practice. I don't think we believe that this case competition solves our problem, but it contributes to it and makes us create ourselves. The strength is that we are in each country in the world. What is good, modern professional communication in an international context? That can demonstrate to ourselves. More about that later when we talk about this case and our little competition."

Welcome to the Cocktail Spirit, the small screen network. I'm your host, Robert Hess. In the heyday of Hollywood, Chasen's in LA was one of the favorite hangouts of a lot of stars. Dean Martin was one of them. He would constantly go there and have his famous martinis. One day, however, he's getting kind of tired of the same old drink, and so he asked the head bartender, Pepe Rui, to make him something different, perhaps. Pepe took a little bit of time to think about it, and on Dean's next visit he provided him a drink he called the flame of love. Let's take a look. It's an extremely simple drink as far as the mixing part goes. It's just made out of two ounces of vodka. The complexity of this drink however comes from the process of preparing the glass. The first step, which isn't too difficult, is simply taking some Fino Cherries. What I'm using is an amontillado, putting a little bit of into the glass like that swirling it around the coat much the way many bartenders today might improperly make a dry martini and then discard the excess. The next step is a little bit tricky though however. We're going to start off and we're going to need some coins of an orange peel. These are simply cut just by taking a knife and just cutting off the orange peel. You want to get enough of the pith to add some structure to the peel a bit but you don't want to get down into the fruit itself. Now what we do is take a match, light it, let the sulfur compounds burn off, and now heat up the peel a little bit. Keep that this a few times. What we're basically trying to do is coat the glass with the orange oils. I'm going to do this until the orange basically gives up its ghost, and you switch to another peel. One more in here. I'm going to take one final peel. I'm going to take a little bit of orange peel, go across out there, get some oils. The oils are now getting on the skin of the peel. I'm going to take those and rub those on the outside and the inside. We're basically getting a wonderful orange oil concept going on here. Some fresh orange oil as well as some caramelized orange oils. Now we're going to take and stir the drink with ice, strain it in. Then I'm going to just add as a final touch of garnish an orange twist on the top because the drink looks either plain without something like that. Now the story goes that Dean Martin loved this drink and so did many of his buddies. One time Frank Sinatra was in at Chasens. He basically ordered a round of flame of love for everybody in the restaurant. You can see how complex and time-consuming it was to take and make the orange bills and things. The bartenders weren't quite happy about having this drink created in that fashion. They wish it would have been a little bit easier to make. So let's check out this flame of love. The orange definitely comes through and it's not just the fresh oranges you still you're also smelling that kind of that caramelized scent which is a more deeper, rounder, richer sort of flavor. And it definitely tastes like more than simply a glass of cold vodka. There's a little hint of the Montiado or the the Cherries coming through to it but the orange oils and it's not overpowering orange oil because I think the flame of the orange oils helps soften that quite a bit. If that had all been fresh orange oils it would have been a little bit too I think orangey. But this kind of has that smoky caramelized sort of essence going on on. It's very simple. It's not a complex drink. If you're wanting something complex with, you know, been addicting in chartreuse, this is definitely not the right drink for you. But if you're a vodka drinker or you want something that's just nice, clean, crisp, very simple drink, this has something a little bit elevated above that. And there we have the Flame of Love.","Let's take a look at apparently one of Dean Martin's favorite drinks, the Flame of Love. Welcome to the Cocktail Spirit, the small screen network.

So my mom is Japanese. So I did one side of this Japan and my dad's family is from Germany. So this side is all German. So we'll start over here. So I put a different background paper that's from the Far East pack from DCWV. And so that's on the background. And then I took one of these noteworthy sheets, this little sheet right here, and used it as a pocket. So that's what's holding all the pictures. And then these digits that I got are from I colored her in using my Prismacolor pencils. I bought some of these 3 dimensional, I think it was, recollections. So there's all these different little embellishments. There's cherry blossom right here. Then I just found a flag of Japan and ran it off on the computer. Got a little paper clip. And inside the little pocket are pictures of my mom's side. And I know I have a picture of my grandfather, my mom's dad, but I can't remember what I did with it, so that's gonna go in here as well. But then up here behind the pictures are stickers, so they say Tokyo. That's where she was born. And then there's one that says Kyoto, Kobe, Kobe, and then Mount Fuji. So there's mom and that was me when I was born. I think I was only like a couple weeks old in those pictures. And then there's my mom and dad and my brother and me of course. And then this is my mom's sister who still lives in Japan. And then I also put this little Japanese card just in the back. So that is that side. And then over on the German side, we have the little girl also from the paper shelter and I also colored her with the prismas. I found some more stuff off the internet, just little tags and stuff that I could put on there. Again used another sheet of the noteworthy paper underneath here and then used some thickers to spell out Germany. I guess I didn't show this part where that came with the recollections pack as well. So in this pocket I went behind there's a little October fest. So this is my dad's mom and dad. So my paternal grandparents. And they were, their parents never came to America. They stayed over in Germany. So they were the first two to come over to America. So that's them on their wedding day. There's my dad when he was, I think this is his senior, his senior picture. And then there's my dad with me. And then there's little me. all in that pocket. So there's kind of an overview of that page and then my other page. Oh, here it is. Okay, this also in my All About Me book. This is my favorite baseball team. So, got some Thicker's, Bella Boston Red Sox, more stuff I found online, just printed them off. This digi is from Saturated Canary and it's called Crushing on the Quarterback. I colored her in the colors of Boston. I used my prisoners on that as well. I put some washi tape here and across here. I wrote about what happened here as we went to Pittsburgh for Chandler's tournament. It just so happened that Boston was playing the Pirates that same weekend. and got tickets and we were able to go to the game. There's our little ticket. This actually has the Pirates logo behind it so I just found this online and put it over top of that. But it was in Pittsburgh where we saw it. Here is this little tag, a little journaling tag where I just filled it out with the score, the date, and then that was some of the lineup. And then there's pictures from the game. Colton didn't go with us that time. He was still here. And then these little, these stickers here are from recollections as well. Michael's had them 50% off last week. So that's my bottom. So that is what I've been working on over the weekend. Also, I had to go to Joanne's to pick up Morfelt and I found the Amy Tangerine Day Book. mini book whatever it's called. So I think I'm going to save this. We're going down to the Outer Banks next month. Ooh that's like really blurry. There we go. We're going to the Outer Banks at the end of next month. So I think I'm going to save this to put all our pictures and stuff from that in here. Maybe if I have enough room. I love this little guest check here. It's really cute. So anyway, just wanted to share those with you and gonna work on a couple more pages here tonight. So hopefully I'll have some more to share.

Um pouco segundo ao juntar esta de lixa aqui, não contando o tanto que tem, tanto para cima como para baixo. Local de rara beleza localizado no coração da cidade vem sendo desespeitado por alguns visitantes que não têm consciência de preservação ambiental. Liço como este pode ser encontrado frequentemente pela trilha. Metais e plásticos demoram muitos anos para se decompor. As sacolas de plástico, por exemplo, demoram pelo menos 300 anos para assumir o domingo ambiente. As garrafas duram indefinidamente e os copos plásticos chegam a demorar 450 anos para se decompor. podem às vezes ingerir algum pedaço de plástico que eles acabam morrendo, sufocado, por indigestão. Então, é muito importante não deixar que as pessoas se conscientizem a não deixar o lixo para trás. Andamos por esta área verde, uma extensão de 1300 metros de trilha e encontramos, além da poluição ambiental, uma mata ciliar, palmáceas e plantas como cacau, que não é típica do cerrado e sim da mata atlântica. Enivalter nos fala um pouco desse tesouro ecológico. esse prazer de conviver aqui. Uma pena está suja, com plásticos e as pessoas não têm aquela educação ainda. Pode ter a vontade, mas às vezes os próximos moradores da cidade prejudicam o meio ambiente aqui. Sem dúvida precisamos fazer alguma coisa nesse EQ.","Accommodated trash in the ecological trail Viri calls the attention of João Luiz and his ally during the trip. A few seconds to join the trash here, not counting the amount that is there, both up and down. A rare location located in the heart of the city is being disrespected by some visitors who do not have awareness of environmental preservation. trash like this can be found frequently by the trail. Metals and plastics take many years to decompose. Plastic bags, for example, take at least 300 years to disappear from the environment. The bottles last indefinitely. And the plastic cups take 450 years to decompose. Everyone knows the importance of not leaving the trash when you're going to make a trail, when you're going to enter nature, you can never leave your trash behind, because that hurts nature, it hinders the life of animals, They can sometimes ingest some pieces of plastic that they end up dying, focused on indigestion. So it's very important not to let people get aware, not to leave the trash behind. We went through this green area, an extension of 1,300 meters in length, and we found, besides environmental pollution, a silky-dust, palm trees and plants like cacao, which is not typical of serrado, but of the Atlantic Forest. Enivalter tells us a little about this ecological treasure. We have a treasure here near us, right? He already, by himself, he already tries to project himself. He is a running man of wild animals from the Serra de Caldas to the Ipea Posa, part of this spring. And it is asking for help here for us to know, preserve this nature that is offering us this this pleasure of living here. It's a pity to be dirty, with plastic, and people don't have that education yet. They may have the will, but sometimes the next residents of the city, they harm the environment here. Without a doubt we need to do something here."

Hey Al Brandell, accept the oath of office of president of the International Association of Lions Clubs. I wanted to set a tone that the members are the most important people in Lions International. Lions make miracles through service and you are an everyday hero. We're called on Lions to embrace their role as everyday heroes and Lions responded. I am an everyday hero. I'm off visiting everyday heroes just like you. His first visit as international president, Al went to the area devastated by the earthquake in Sichuan province. I visited the lions of China and I thought that I knew what it was to be a lion until I witnessed their miracles and their dedication. There was one group of lions that drove for three days to get to the earthquake site. Within 33 hours they had a temporary school building. and it was built in the shadows of a destroyed school where 13 of the children's classmates had perished and 16 were rescued. When I walked into those school buildings, I saw children that were laughing, that were smiling, that were singing, and it was a sense of normalcy that would not have happened if it wasn't for those Lions Club members there. Meeting so many people around the world, the faces may be different, the languages are different, but the heart is there. I have a lion. Lions Club members tell me about their projects and what they do in their own community. They are so proud of that and I look into their eyes and I just say, you're an everyday hero. International President Al and Maureen received a warm welcome from the Lions of Africa. In Kenya, they visited a Lions clinic where mothers with HIV AIDS received formula to feed their newborns to prevent infecting them with the virus. rate of not passing the hiv virus on to their children a miracle through service in Burkina Faso they visited an orphanage supported by lions most of the kids were alert they were smiling they were reaching out for love it was so moving for us if it wasn't for the lions members there most of those children would have no future everyday heroes in Burkina Faso throughout the world the president witnessed numerous ways that lions are championing The one great common denominator, the passion that all Lions Club members have appears to be working with kids. And we have to continue because those kids are our future. I met with the president of the Navajo Nation and he discussed some of the needs of his people. There's a diabetes epidemic in people's eyesight being affected because of diabetes. We were able to provide some first class service for the people of the United States. the Navajo Nation that wouldn't have had it. Once you put a pair of eyeglasses on somebody that cannot see properly and they look at your face and they have the smile, you'll be a lion for the rest of your life. As president, we've got to have a sense of humor. You know how the lions like to have fun. When we go to any type of meeting with Lions Club members, our goal is to meet every lion that's in the building. Now here's a crew to figure out where I am. We were so happy to be at the Rose Bowl Parade I sat down with presidents of other organizations like our own and they were discussing some of their challenges and one of their challenges is membership development. I was particularly proud because I was able to tell them that we have a global increase. Brandel was a driving force behind organizing the first global youth and site partners symposiums. I saw this as a perfect opportunity for us to review with our partners where we've been, where we've been, where we are today, where we're going in the future. Former US President Jimmy Carter dedicated the Gift of Sight statue honoring the great strides partner organizations have made against river blindness. Carter thanked Lions and underscored how Lions have impacted his life. I would never have been ambitious enough to seek the governorship of Georgia had it not been for Lions. I would never have dreamed of being president of the United States had it not been for Lions. to leave this organization better than when I found it. I have no doubt because of those partner meetings we're going to continue to grow our relationships around the world. We serve. We certainly do serve. At the Winter World Games, Brandel chartered a new Special Olympics Lions club. Shortly after, he chartered another in Whittier, California. Presenting that charter meant so much to me because I had a direct involvement in improving the quality of life in California and improving the cooperation and partnership with Special Olympics. I'm about to administer the oath of membership. My dream for the future of Lions Club International is continued growth. More members. Not for the sake of numbers, but every one new member gives us two hands for more community service. Lions are... ...everyday heroes. Al presided over a memorable Alliance Day at the United Nations where global issues of peace, youth and environment took center stage. I thank you for your commitment to our common goals. And I think that the role of the international president is to connect the dots with organizations that we are currently partnering with or that we should be partnering with. I'll continue building alliances during visits in Europe. In Switzerland, he strengthened relationships with the World Health Organization. the Global Fund and the International Federation of the Red Cross. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Red Cross that will help us deliver services next to the Red Cross. We will work in partnership with you, but we're going to work under the banner of Lions Club International. It's one thing to write a check, but it's another thing to have hands on. Every day hero. Australia have just been outstanding during this time of catastrophe with the wildfires they had going on there. But a simple thing, like Lions Club members putting a warehouse together, just bringing clothing, toys for children, soap, towels, the things we take for granted, simple acts of kindness. These are the everyday heroes. This year has just been an unbelievable year for more than myself. Traveling around the world, meeting heads of state, religious leaders, being interviewed by media, But most importantly, seeing the Lions' projects and listening to their stories about the miracles of the day happen. And I thank the Lions for giving me this opportunity to serve you. I want every lion to understand that what they do is important. And to just stand up and say that, yes, I am an everyday hero, and I do make miracles happen through service. I am an everyday hero. I am an everyday hero. Lions are... EVERYDAY! Lions are everyday heroes.","How you doing? Hey Al Brandel, accept the oath of office of president of the International Association of Lions Clubs.

Once you put a pair of eyeglasses on somebody that cannot see properly and they look at your face and they have the smile, you'll be a lion for the rest of your life. As president, we've got to have a sense of humor. You know how the lions like to have fun. When we go to any type of meeting with Lions Club members, our goal is to meet every lion that's in the building. Now here's a crew to figure out where I am. We were so happy to be at the Rose Bowl Parade I sat down with presidents of other organizations like our own and they were discussing some of their challenges and one of their challenges is membership development. I was particularly proud because I was able to tell them that we have a global increase. I saw this as a perfect opportunity for us to review with our partners where we've been, where we've been, where we are today, where we're going in the future. Former US President Jimmy Carter dedicated the Gift of Sight statue honoring the great strides partner organizations have made against river blindness. Carter thanked Lions and underscored how Lions have impacted his life. I would never have been ambitious enough to seek the governorship of Georgia had it not been for Lions. I would never have dreamed of being president of the United States had it not been for Lions. We serve. We certainly do serve. life in California and improving the cooperation and partnership with Special Olympics. I'm about to administer the oath of membership. My dream for the future of Lions Club International is continued growth. More members. Not for the sake of numbers, but every one new member gives us two hands for more community service. Lions are... ...everyday heroes. Al presided over a memorable Alliance Day at the United Nations where global issues of peace, youth and environment took center stage. I thank you for your commitment to our common goals. I think that the role of the international president is to connect the dots with organizations that we are currently partnering with or that we should be partnering with. I'll continue building alliances during visits in Europe. In Switzerland, he strengthened relationships with the World Health Organization. the Global Fund and the International Federation of the Red Cross. We signed a memorandum of understanding with the Red Cross that will help us deliver services next to the Red Cross. We will work in partnership with you, but we're going to work under the banner of Lions Club International. It's one thing to write a check, but it's another thing to have hands on. Every day hero. Australia have just been outstanding during this time of catastrophe with the wildfires they had going on there. But a simple thing, like Lions Club members putting a warehouse together, just bringing clothing, toys for children, soap, towels, the things we take for granted, simple acts of kindness. These are the everyday heroes. This year has just been an unbelievable year for more than myself. Traveling around the world, meeting heads of state, religious leaders, being interviewed by media, But most importantly, seeing the Lions' projects and listening to their stories about the miracles of the day happen. And I thank the Lions for giving me this opportunity to serve you. I want every lion to understand that what they do is important. And to just stand up and say that, yes, I am an everyday hero and I do make miracles happen through service. I am an everyday hero. I am an everyday hero. Lions are... EVERY DAY! Lions are everyday heroes."

Riesce addirittura a passare in vantaggio dopo appena tre minuti angolo di conti, svetta acqua fresca che arriva prima di oddo e mette la palla sul paro lontano la dove Dida non può arrivare. E l'inizio intanto si allenta la tensione perché dopo tutto quel che è successo chiaramente il gol serve a tranquillizzare un po' la squadra e sei subito in vantaggio. colpo di testa di acqua fresca che in quadra lo spiche la porta salta molto bene in anticipo suodo che in ritardo al momento della chiusura. Al minuto di reagina guardate quanto è corto il calio di aggressivo pochissimo spazio difficilissimo a entrare vedete che il raddoppio e sistematico dispendioso questo tipo di gioco con conclusione alla distanza di serginio l'unica che rimane così come rimane l'unica possibilità in questo caso vedete il calio e tutto dentro l'area di rigore riesce ad allontanare poi fuori raccoglie e maldini controllo e tiro con pallone intercettato a fortini questo è il tema della prima parte del incontro col Cagliari che poi talvolta appunge. Lo fa in questo caso con Foggia che parte molto bene sull'invito di Biondini qui tenta il tiro cross invece di dar palla verso dietro, forse poteva essere sfruttata meglio questa occasione. Qui ancora Cagliari che difende bene riparte si vede meglio un po' tutta la situazione almeno 10 giocatori dietro la linea della palla e poi ripartenza con gli esterni che accompagnano l'azione e esterni che peraltro poi ne parliamo, ha giocato sulle esterni, no, matri più che a qualsprenza ma il gravo sia stato annunciato l'impiego di Acqua fresca sull'esterno e è stato matri a andare molto più spesso a sinistra. Qui un angolo per il Milan e Ferri che salva la situazione, il colpo di testa sul primo palo, Ferri ben apostato, riesce ad allontanare l'aminaccia. Ancora Milan con quest'altra palla scagliata avanti, vedete che il calio comunque non concede spazio, non permette mai al Milan di concludere e lo farà per tutto il primo tempo. Iniziativa di Serginio, cerca un varco, serve Ronaldo il tentativo di chilo contrato dall'ottima chiusura di Agostini che avete visto è andato a chiudere partendo da sinistra per raddoppia la marcatura non permette il tiro a Ronaldo e qui il calcio di Rigore la sponda da parte di Gattuso va giù nella circostanza Ronaldo a vedere i replay che vedremo più avanti sembrava che non ci sia fallo anche se poi c'è questa maglietta che con il numero che assume una posizione strana la vedremo più avanti comunque. Rigore affidato a Cacca di Fortin sceglie l'angolo e su quell'angolo batte Cacca, Fortin riesce a intercettare tutto questo per meditarsi poi un bel colpi di petto da parte dei compagni subito dopo l'apparata. Rivediamo la conclusione che fortina va scelto, battezzato bene l'angolo giusto e riesce a intercettare e a deviare il pallone calciato a cacà. Il secondo tempo il tema è lo stesso ma addirittura il Milan in avvio è meno aggressivo del primo e del Cagliari che ha qualche occasione per punzecchiare anche se nulla di particolarmente insidioso, più un cross di biondini colpiti a acqua fresco La palla svirgolata da odddo che riesce ad allontanare. Altro cross, questa volta di foggio, il colpo di testa di bianco non ci arriva per un soffio matri al tapin giusto. Il caliari a questo punto comincia a disunirsi. Vedete che gli spazi sono cresciuti, le distanze sono più larghe e qui il milan ne approfita. Una prima conclusione in Ronaldo con la palla sul palo, quindi ancora vedete quanti varchi ora ci sono anche nella zona centrale. Qui un'altra iniziativa in storia sinistra con Sergio Arginio che conclude il palen diagonale che è terminalato e poi e l'occasione del gol che nasce per l'ennesima volta sulle carambole. Il cali ha già subito tante volte le carambole. Anche oggi capita la stessa cosa. A Torino ha perso per due carambole e in Mila ampareggio ha per una carambola che Giardino sfrutta al meglio anticipando poi Fortin e mettendo la palla in rete. Uno a uno a questo punto. Il punteggio è, vedremo tra poco, il repre, vedete, la palla mancata da Lopez che carambola su bianco e poi Giardino in aguato che sfrutta al meglio l'occasione per pareggiare il conto. il salvataggio di Bonera che spazza via. Il Milan attacca ma non ci sono grandissime occasioni qui. Bianco che fa correre un rivido ai tifosi del Cagliati col colpo di testa che manda fuori la palla. Sulla angolo la battuta di Pirlo che cerca Ca'fu, bella per coordinazione la conclusione del brasiliano. La palla alta sulla traversa. Anche il Cagliati conclude comunque questa relazione costruita a Biondini. Ferri all'indietro per parola conclusione, condida che blocca a Cerenaguatofini che sperava in una palla Mancata il calcio di punizione che deciderà partita calcio a pierlo tiro centrale fortine che Non sembrava aver responsabilità in un primo momento nel rivedere replete dietro però il passettino sulla destra come è capitato già a bergamolo fari vediamo qui la conclusione tiro che tra l'altro si spegna centrale anche se si abbassa in provviso vedete passettino a destra poi tenta di tornare a quel punto sul sinistro non ha la spinta è probabilmente anche per questo non ci arriva a riprendere posizione centrale tanto da devi il pallone, il Cagliari subisce subisce subisce subisce subisce le anisimo calcio di punizione in questo caso","You can play a game against a team you could lose. You can even pass the ball in three minutes. You can see the angle, the fresh water coming in before the game and you put your ball on the far side where you can't get to. You slow down the tension because after all that has happened, you need to calm down the team and get back to the game. and the ball is hit by the water. The ball jumps very well in the front, which is late at the moment of the close-up. In the first half of the game, look at how short the ball is. It's aggressive, very little space, very difficult to get in. The double and systematic, this kind of game, with a distance, the only chance left is to see the ball in the corner, then the ball goes out, it's picked up, it's shot, with a ball intercepted by Fortini. but the Gravo was announced. The Acoa Fresca was on the left, and Matri was on the right. Here, a corner for Milan. Ferri, who saves the situation, the header's attack on the first ball. Ferri, well placed, manages to get the ball away. Still Milan with this other ball forward, you see that the ball doesn't concede space, it never allows Milan to finish, he'll do it all over the first half. The initiative of Sergio Igno, he's looking for a Varko, Ronaldo is in charge, the try-out, I've hired him from the last close-up, The left side is going to double the score, but Ronaldo's goal is not allowed. Rigo's football is going to be a bit more aggressive. Ronaldo's goal is to see the replay. It seems he's not going to make it, but he's going to see it. Rigo's goal is to go for the corner, and he's going for the corner. and then he can intercept all this to get a bit of a hit from the side of the team right after the ball. Let's see the final result. Fortuna chose the right angle and he can intercept and deviate the ball from the side of the team. The second half, the same thing but Milan is less aggressive in the first half and he has a chance to punish even if he doesn't have anything particularly insidious. The goalie who was born for the first time on the Carambola. The club has already scored many times. Today, too, it's happening. Torino lost for two Carambola and Milan are on the way for a Carambola. Girardino is better off with the ball in the net. The score is... The ball is missing from Lopez. He's a great player. and the chance to score. the ball, the ball goes up and the penalty is punished. In this case not even a pair, Bergamo at least took it away, then a pair. In this case, another..."
