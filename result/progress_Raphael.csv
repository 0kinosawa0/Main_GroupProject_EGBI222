So this is kind of the culmination, the hardest thing that you're going to have to do in this unit and I wanted to do it as a couple of example problems based on the lab that we just did. So we have a person pushing on a desk horizontally and the desk doesn't move. And it's a 50 kilogram desk and there's 200 newtons of force applied horizontally. And what we want to do is is we want to draw a free body diagram. We want to set up the equations that describe what's happening in the x direction and in the y direction. And then we want to determine a few coefficients and a few numbers is what I should say. So here's the idea. I know that there's a normal force. I know that there is the downward force of gravity. And let's remember the desk has an inertia of 50 kilograms. I am pushing horizontally this way. the Actually, we'll let you go ahead and do that. What we'll say is that the applied force here exactly equals the static friction. And then when we describe the forces which act in the y direction, we're going to say that the normal force pushing upwards exactly balances the gravitational force pushing downwards. Now, it says now for the next part, determine the value of the frictional force. Well, let's go ahead and do that now. So we're going to have that the frictional force equals the applied force and we were told that that was a 200 Newton force. So I get that from part A. From part B it says get the normal force. Well we know the normal force equals the downward gravitational force. So that's W, which is going to be the inertia times the acceleration due to gravity, which is going to be 50 kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. and when we do 50 times 9.8 we're going to actually end up getting 490 Newtons. Now they ask us to get the coefficient of static friction. Let's just remember from our lab we came up with the equation that the static friction equals the coefficient of friction times the normal force. So basically we can take this and this and obtain what they want. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say 200 Newtons equals mu times 490 just like we did in the lab. This is the equivalent of the spring pushing and then we use the weight to calculate the normal force 490 Newtons. So we get mu is going to be 200 over 490. So we work out mu to be 0.41. Now what we're going to do in our next, and there's no units to make that clear, what we're going to do in the next problem is we're going to actually direct this 200 Newton force at an angle and learn how to deal with that.","I wanted to sort of put the ideas together that are going to be appearing on your exam into a couple of example problems.

Dalla 2008 a oggi una crisi senza precedenti ha stravolto l'intera economia europea e tuttora gli equilibri dell'Unione restano a dir poco precari. A manifestare crepe preoccupanti e soprattutto la tenuta della moneta unica. Il recente default della Grecia in particolare ha fatto tremare pesantemente la solidità del sistema, rimasto in piedi solo perché difesso strenuamente dalla BCE, la Banca Accentrata, il cosiddetto salvataggio dell'economia ellenica peraltro non sembra avere mai dato i frutti ispirati. Anzi potrebbe rivelarsi un poso senza fondo. Paralelamente la recessione si sta allargando a macchia d'olio spingendo sempre più a fondo anche altri paesi dell'area mediterranea, inclusa l'Italia. Nel bel paese il potere d'acquisto, cioè il reddito disponibile delle famiglie in termini reali durante la crisi, è crollato scendendo del 5% tra il 2007 e il 2011. In verità da più parti si evidenzia una ulteriore infaosta previsione. I difetti strutturali dell'Europa e dell'Euro sembrano destinati ad esplodere clamorosamente proprio entro la fine dell'anno in corso, il 2013. Ma quali colpe si possono adebitare alla moneta unica? Se ci si attiene semplicemente ai fatti, l'avvento del nuovo conio ha coincisto negli anni, con una drastica perdita di competitività di due pilastre dell'Unione, come Italia e Francia, oltre che di paesi altrettanto importanti come Spagna, Portogallo e Grecia. Una coincidenza solo casuale, del resto già nel 1997 il professor Wilhelm Henkel, economista tedesco, che ha ricoperto più volte in carichi istituzionali e di governo, dichiarava sconcertato. Come si fa ad immaginarli che una moneta unica possa funzionare per un conglomerato di stati ed economie così diversi. Domande in evase quelle di Hankel sia in Germania che nel resto d'Europa. E così, eccoci arrivati ai risultati odierni, quelli che condannano duramente paesi come il nostro. L'Italia, come dimostra uno studio JP Morgan, ha visto negli ultimi anni la crescita più lenta tra le economie avanzate, al punto da segnare il peggior addonamento da i tempi della sua unificazione. Un quasi analogo comportamento afflitto alla produzione francese e la quota di profitti aziendali rispetto al valore aggiunto è la più piccola tra i sei maggiori paesi europei. Inoltre la Francia presenta un deficit delle partite correnti superiore all'Italia e un deficit pubblico che nel 2013 potrebbe essere il doppio di quello italiano. I salvataggi si rivelano fallimentari, il debito aumenta, le strategie che economiche di austerità sollevano uno sdegno popolare sempre più evidente e accentuato. Come reagire a questo punto? Le risposte alla crisi in verità non mancano e su tutte ne campeggia una che ormai accomuna le più diverse posizioni politiche, abbandonare l'euro in tutta fretta. Il Movisol, Movimento per i diritti civili e la solidarietà guidato dall'economista statunitense Lyndon Larush più volte candidato alla Presidenza degli Stati Uniti, propone da anni di ristrutturare l'intero sistema finanziario internazionale. Secondo la russia la finanzializzazione dell'economia internazionale, causa della rovina crescente delle attività produttive, si affermata dal 1971 come conseguenza dell'abolizione delle parità fisse tra le monete e di altre norme di vigilanza monetaria che erano state istituite nel 1944 a Bretton Woods. In quella conferenza monetaria internazionale fu fondato il sistema che consentì il cosiddetto miracolo economico del dopo guerra. Il movimento solidarietà propone di rifondare un sistema monetario secondo quella originaria impostazione generale. La proposta è quella di una nuova Bretton Woods, una conferenza delle maggiori nazioni del mondo per decidere di ristabilire parità fisse tra le monete rispetto a loro, allo scopo di rendere possibile il finanzamento a lungo termine delle attività produttive commerciali reali e di vietare la speculazione sui cambi. Per il movisolo corre poi congelare e annullare i titoli finanziari speculativi che ammontano a svariate migliaia di miliardi di dollari. E bisogna mettere crediti d'emergenza per garantire al regolare svolgimento delle attività più essenziali e crediti agevolati ai grandi programmi infrastrutturali dai quali deriverà notevole impulso anche all'impresa produttiva privata. Non ultimo ci sono da ripristinare regole e controlli aboliti dalla deregulation sulle attività finanziarie e amministrative. In tale contesto è necessario incoraggiare i Paesi a istituire banche nazionali sotto la sovranità del Parlamento in sostituzione dell'attuale sistema delle banche centrali, indipendenti. Da quei dunque l'esigenza ineludibile di tornare alle monete nazionali. la moneta nazionale ci vuole spiega il Movisol perché senza di essa non è possibile mettere credito produttivo. Quando si parla dei danni procurati dall'euro non bisogna pensare solo al rapporto di cambio o all'aumento dei prezzi al consumo. Quanto alla sottrazione degli strumenti di politica economica per far fronte alla crisi? Primo fra tutti l'emissione del credito. Il credito è indispensabile per far crescere l'economia, dunque il ritorno alla sovrattura monetaria è imprescindibile dall'impegne e quindi dall'assunzione di responsabilità per le missioni di credito che finanzi gli investimenti. Contestualmente va affissato il rapporto di cambio, cioè il valore della moneta secondo il valore potenziale di questa moneta, espresso dal contenuto tecnologico del piano di investimenti promosso, che definisce Concentrion is uniricare, con un' anche il depito pubblico viene denunciato come se fosse un'eresia senza nemmeno considerare che cosa si fa con questo depito pubblico perché uno stato dovrebbe rinunciare a fare investimenti. Altri economisti di Spico, nel frattempo, si schierano contro la moneta unica e il caso del Professor Bruno Amoroso, studioso ed esperto, si è chiesto che la moneta unica, di fama internazionale, a lungo stretto collaboratore di Federico Caffè. degli anni 80, dopo la deregolamentazione introdotta da Reagan e continuata poi da Clinton, Bush e fino a Obama, una politica economica che è resso possibile la programmazione e la realizzazione, per dirla con le parole dell'autore, di grandi truffe a carico dei contribuenti. L'euro è un'idea folle che sta portando povertà sul larga scala, ha dichiarato Amoroso in una recente intervista parsa sul web. Oggi le crisi finanziarie e ancora amoroso a parlare mettono a nudo l'insufficienza di uno strumento che è diventato un mezzo di controllo delle economie. Lo strangolamento dei paesi del sud non solo d'Europa e sotto gli occhi di tutti. Quello che oggi si sta avverando è il compimento di un piano di apartheid globale messo in opera dal 1971 con l'avvio della globalizzazione. Più che nel paradosso siamo nel mondo dell'assurdo. L'Europa ha pensato di avere una moneta al posto di un governo a messa una banca, governare 27 paesi europei mediante una banca, se non è uno scherzo, è una follia. Ma come trovare una via d'uscita? 10 anni di Europa essano secondo Amoroso, allora troviamo il modo di regolare l'economia per riequilibrare le forze in campo, poiché i problemi sono stati creati nella zona euro e dentro questa che si deve trovare una soluzione di riequilibrio, creando due euro nord sud, ricordati tra loro da un rapporto di cambio fisso e un patto di solidarietà. Se non si fa questo, il rischio di grossi conflitti sociali è elevatissimo secondo Amoroso, per questo è bene agire subito riportando il buon senso nella politica e nella società. Il bivio è evidente, morstua vitamea, morire per l'euro o far morire l'euro.","The escape from the euro is no longer a taboo. Since 2008 today a crisis without precedents has been the whole European economy and now the balance of the union remains to be said little precarious. To manifest worrying and above all the holding of the unique currency. The recent default of Greece in particular has made the system's solidity heavily shaking, only because it has defended strangely from the BCE, the bank of The so-called saving of the Lenin economy, for the rest, seems to have never given the fruits hope. In fact, it could reveal itself a place without a fund. At the same time, the recession is spreading in oil markets, always pushing further and further, even other countries of the Mediterranean area, including Italy. In the beautiful country, the purchasing power, that is, the credit available to families in real terms during the crisis, is crumbled. the 5% between 2007 and 2011. In fact, on the most part, there is evidence of a further in Faos prediction. The structural defects of Europe and the euro seem to be intended to explode clamorously, just at the end of the year in the course of 2013. But what blows can be debited for the unique currency? If it is simply obtained from facts, the advent of the new cognate coincides with the with a drastic loss of competitiveness of two pillars of the union, such as Italy and France, other than countries as important as Spain, Portugal and Greece. A coincidence only casual, in the other already in 1997, Professor Wilhelm Hankel, German economist, who had more often covered in the charge of government institutions, declared disconcerted. How do you imagine the situation in Italy? that a single currency can work for a conglomerate of states and economies so diverse. Questions are not important, those of Hankel, both in Germany and in the rest of Europe. And so, here we are, at the end of the day, those who condemn hard countries like ours. Italy, as a study by JP Morgan, has seen in recent years the slowest growth among advanced economies, to the point of marking the worst The French market is the largest market in Europe, and the largest market in Europe is the largest market in Europe. the economic and austerity levels raised a more evident and accentuated popular concern, as well as to react to this point. The answers to the crisis in reality do not lack and, above all, it is one that is now in the hands of the most different political positions, leaving the euro in full swing. The Movisol movement for civil rights and solidarity led by the economic status quo and the Russian Indon, more often candidate for the presidency of the United States, It proposes for years to restructure the entire international financial system. According to Russia, the financialization of the international economy, due to the growing ruin of the productive activities, has been signed since 1971 as a consequence of the abolition of fixed parity between the currencies and other huge monetary vigilance that were instituted in 1944 in Bretton Woods. In that international monetary conference the system that allows the so-called economic miracle of the after-war was founded. The solidarity movement proposes to rebuild a monetary system according to the general setting. The proposal is that of a new Bretton Woods, a conference of the largest nations in the world to decide to restore fixed parity between the coins compared to them, in order to make possible the financial to the long-term of the real commercial productive activities and to avoid speculation on exchanges. For the move, it is then necessary to freeze and cancel the speculative financial titles that amount to thousands of billions of dollars. And you have to put emergency credits to ensure the regular development of the most essential activities and credit to the great infrastructural programs from which it will deliver a remarkable boost also at the private productive enterprise. Finally, there are rules and controls abolished by the deregulation on administrative financial activities. In this context, it is necessary to encourage countries to establish national banks under the sovereignty of the parliament in the replacement of the current system of independent central banks. Therefore, the need is inevitable to return to national currencies. The national currency wants to explain the Movisol because without it it is not possible to put productive credit. When you talk about the damage caused by the euro, you don't have to think only about the exchange or the increase in the price to consumption, as well as the subtraction of the economic policy tools to face the crisis, first of all the emission of credit. Credit is indispensable to make the economy grow, therefore the return to the sovereign the financial and financial credit for the investment. Contextualy, the exchange ratio is fixed, that is, the value of the currency according to the potential value of this express currency, from the technological content of the promoted investment plan, which defines the potential productivity of the economic system in the long term. the United Monetary Union's fundamental mistake was that the public debt was denounced as if it were a heresy, without even considering what to do with this public debt, because a state should renounce its investments. Other economists of Spico, meanwhile, are arguing against the single currency and the case of Professor Bruno Amoroso, a scholar and expert in the field of economics, of international fame along with a long-term collaborator of Federico Caffè. In his book Euro in Bilico Amoroso, he reconstructs with extreme clarity the causes of the crisis in action and the irresponsible individuals, the same ones who have led to the collapse of the Borses, the financial groups that manage most of the moutui for the houses and the investment banks. A crisis explains to the Italian economist that it is only the last of a long series started in the middle of the after the deregulation introduced by Reagan and then continued from Clinton, Bush until Obama, an economic policy that is possible to program the realization, to say it with the words of the author, of great truths in charge of the contributors. The euro is a crazy idea that is bringing poverty on a large scale, said Amoroso in a recent interview published on the web. Today financial crises are and still loving to talk, put a knot in the insufficiency of a tool that has become a means of control of the economy. The strangle of the countries of the South, not only Europe, is under everyone's eyes. What is happening today is the fulfillment of a plan of global apartheid put into operation since 1971 with the advent of globalization. More than in the paradox, we are in the world of the absurd. Europe has thought of having a coin instead of a government to put a bank, to govern 27 European countries by a bank, if it is not a joke, it is madness. But how to find a way out? 10 years of Europe are under the second love, then we find the way to regulate the economy to re-equilibre the forces in the field, since the problems have been created in the euro zone and within this one you have to find a re-equilibrium solution, creating 2 euros north of the euro zone. and the South, remembered among them by a fixed exchange relationship and a pact of solidarity. If this is not done, the risk of major social conflicts is very high, according to Amoroso, so it is good to immediately act by reporting the good sense of politics in society. The Bible is evident. Morse your vitamin, die for euros or let the euro die."

One that's just Photoshop and if you ever heard of down and dirty tricks those are usually all involved Scott Kelby or some of his group. Well several years ago Yahoo! photos switched over and became something called Flickr. When they did that a lot of people it caught on to a lot of people and they started forming groups on Flickr. They started doing something called Photo Walks and people would in an area together that were interested in the same type of photography would all meet in a place for a day and just go around for a couple of hours and all take pictures and then they'd all upload them to the site and go over them look over each other's pictures and and critique them. Well Scott Kelby saw this going on and he thought, wow how about if we took this worldwide. So about four years ago I actually Four years ago, he started the first worldwide photo walk. Scott Kelby for Worldwide Photo Walk. And the first year it involved six countries and about 10,000 people. Where one day out of the year everybody got together in these little groups in these different cities in these different countries around the world and all went out and took photos and put them all up loaded. the mall to the site. Well Panama City doesn't have one. It's grown in all those years where now there's about 30,000 people involved in nine countries. There are 366 groups in the state of Florida, but there's only two groups in, well three groups in northwest Florida. There's one in Tallahassee, one in Destin and one in Pensacola. But we don't have one here in Panama City. And I'd like to change that. So I would like to appeal to you to think about the idea of maybe getting together and getting grouped together to do a worldwide photo walk where Scott Kelby every year up until this one for the past three years it has taken place in July. Well that's one of the reasons I didn't push too hard to have one in Panama City because I'm just telling you it's awfully hot in Panama City in July but this year they're going to change it and it will be in October. They have it set for the first weekend in October and I think that a wonderful time to have one here in Panama City. We have a lot that we could photograph in October. So I'd like you all to take a look. Google Scott Kelby, that's K-E-L-B-Y, and check out his photo walk and see what you think. And if you think you might be interested, then shoot me an email. I have just sent out my contact information for all of you so that you can keep in contact with me. And I'd like for you you to consider this. Now you don't have to have fancy cameras, you don't have to have anything even as good as what I've got. Any kind of camera will do. The one that I went to in Lynchburg, Virginia, people had anything from a throwaway disposable camera to some that make mine look like they're cheap crap. So anyway, y'all look them up, see what you think, shoot me an email and I would very much like to see you all in a October we could do maybe St. Andrews State Park or somewhere downtown in Panama City.

Well Scott Kelby saw this going on and he thought wow how about if we took this worldwide. So about four years ago I actually I Four years ago, he started the first worldwide photo walk. Scott Kelby for Worldwide Photo Walk. And the first year it involved six countries and about 10,000 people. Where one day out of the year everybody got together in these little groups in these different cities in these different countries around the world and all went out and took photos and put them all up loaded. the mall to the site. Well Panama City doesn't have one. It's grown in all those years where now there's about 30,000 people involved in nine countries. There are 366 groups in the state of Florida but there's only two groups in, well three groups in northwest Florida. There's one in Tallahassee, one in Destin and one in Pensacola. But we don't have one here in Panama City and I'd like to change that. So I would like to appeal to you to think about the idea of maybe getting together and getting grouped together to do a worldwide photo walk where Scott Kelby every year up until this one for the past three years it has taken place in July. Well that's one of the reasons I didn't push too hard to have one in Panama City because I'm just telling you it's awfully hot in Panama City in July. But this year they're going to change it and it will be in October. They have it set for the first weekend in October and I think that a wonderful time to have one here in Panama City. We have a lot that we can photograph in October. So I'd like you all to take a look. Google Scott Kelby, that's K-E-L-B-Y, and check out his photo walk and see what you think. And if you think you might be interested, then shoot me an email. I have just sent out my contact information for all of you so that you can keep in contact with me. And I'd like for you to consider this. Now you don't have to have fancy cameras, you don't have to have anything even as good as what I've got. Any kind of camera will do. The one that I went to in Lynchburg, Virginia, people had anything from a throwaway disposable camera to some that make mine look like they're cheap crap. So anyway, y'all look them up, see what you think, shoot me an email and I would very much like to see you all in a October we could do maybe St. Andrews State Park or somewhere downtown in Panama City. Just I'm open to ideas whatever anybody thinks. I'll see you then. Bye."

Je vous retrouve sur la mat' Preston avec le joli beacon. La mat' Preston, donc aujourd'hui on va vous présenter, je vais vous présenter un système d'ouverture avec des CD, entièrement avec des CD et donc qui ne m'aient détecté que par un seul CD en particulier. Le système, alors le système, vous mettez le jour tout le temps, je vous montre un jour. Ne vous inquiétez pas, d'ailleurs ce système, je vais installer sur un server. Il marche bien, je veux dire. Sauf pour les chunks, je vais mettre un bloc pour les chunks. Je perds l'effet. Donc pour créer ce système, c'est très simple. Il va vous falloir des disques. On va prendre un fait du disque. le CD ne marchera pas Le CD c'est le rouge, je veux dire ça c'est le rouge ou mon CD ? Le rouge ? Euh mon CD Donc regardez Hop, le CD on va le mettre Voilà, la porte est ouverte, un peu vous faites couvrer, etc etc On enlève, ça referme Mais si je vais essayer de mettre par exemple le jaune Alors dehors ça va pas aller assez loin donc le courant ne sera pas loin On va mettre euh, une carnie Voilà, alors voilà le système qui est intéressant, je dis ce système qui débat mal même si c'est avec un repeater blocker Le réputeur blocaire avait des bugs, il fallait initialiser avec une résumé. Ce n'est pas compliqué mais il est très compliqué pour ceux qui ne connaissaient pas trop. Ce système est largement plus simple à comprendre. Je vais mettre mon CD. Ça va faire un circuit restone au-delà de la limite. C'est un point de reston qui va mettre en inversion cette plante de reston. Je vais le dire pour la vidéo du... Je ne vois pas aucune idée du système original. Je relève le CD et ça réactive le restom. Je n'ai aucun contact de restom si j'en ai un. Ça va faire crammer le circuit. Voilà, j'espère que cet tuto vous a plu. N'hésitez pas à poser un like, à vous abonner à la chaîne et de l'aimer. Et je vous dis à la prochaine. Bye bye !","So, we are now on the Preston map with the pretty beacon. So today I'm going to show you an opening system with CD's, and so they are detected by a particular CD. The system will be there all day long. Don't worry, I'm going to install this system on a server. I will use the chunk to create this system The CD will not work except the CD, I will take the CD Max. I have largely shortened this system because the original was there until a while ago, but it is not necessary because beyond the CD you want it stops the run. It's very simple. This piston to explain the system, there is a delay on my repeater that I selected. The red is the CD, the red is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, the CD is the CD, CD is the CD, CD is the CD, CD is the CD, CD is the CD, CD is the CD, CD The problem is that the reputation blocker had bugs, it was necessary to initialize it with a restore name. It's not complicated, but I find it very complicated for those who do not know it too much. I find that this system is much simpler, not necessarily to build, but much simpler to understand. So why is it very simple? For example, look, I'm going to put my CD, it will make a restore circuit that goes beyond the limit. It will make a redstone run that will reverse the redstone's lamp, so it will make the DC. When the redstone is the right CD, the run will not go far enough. The block is active all the time thanks to this redstone torch. The run will be able to pass to the next door. I don't know any original system I can do it I remove the CD it reactives the restown no contact restown if I'm there it will make me crazy I hope you enjoyed this tutorial don't hesitate to like, to subscribe and to like and I'll see you next time bye bye"

Jack and it stars been Gazra who recently passed away in on February 3rd and The film centers around the character of Jack flowers is an American living in Singapore who runs a whorehouse and it follows the tracks his adventures through Singapore as he gets muscled in by the local you know Singapore mafia and his involvement later through the movie with the government you know all to do with you know whores and scandals and stuff like that but you know the film is completely senator it's a big character vehicle for Ben Gazer and in a lot was a big hit for BBS but that's another story. And you know follow that up with several hits like What's Up Doc and Paper Moon. And but after Paper Moon he kind of just went in this downward slope of crap movies. But St. Jack is very different from that. This is a very energetic film and it is a wonderful performance from Ben Gazzard. I mean the guy just shows excellent acting skills in this film and it's the whole movie you just realize how badass Ben Gazzard is. He has no idea what he's gonna do next and it's just amazing to watch. It also stars Den Home Elliot from the Indiana Jones movies and the one-time James Bond George Lazenby has a small role as this dirty politician, but you know and Gazer in this movie is very reminiscent to Humphrey Bogart and Casablanca where you know you've got an American who is not he's not in his homeland, but he is making the best of his situation by Doing what people love the way Ben Gazzar puts it in the movies is people make love for all kinds of crazy reasons why should money be one of them. and opening night and they would later go on to do several films throughout the 70s and 80s and in the 90s he started a lot of independent films like Vincent Gallows Buffalo 66 and which is very very good movie if you're familiar with Vincent Gallows work it's really the only one worth watching if you come across a movie called the brown bunny don't watch it it's not good and then there's he did a film for Todd Salon's called happy Which is a great movie, but if you are overly depressed don't watch it because you're you possibly commit suicide after watching it but besides that besides that it's really great film and then of course Gazzard played the Pornographer Jackie tree horn in the Cohen Brothers classic the big Lebowski But I think the Saints Jack St. Jack stands alone as one of Gazzard's best movies And upon finding this movie, we went on Netflix, they didn't have it. So I went to Hastings and luckily they had it. So point for Hastings and their ongoing struggle to beat out their internet competitors. And we rented it and watched it and just fell in love with this movie. The energy and the atmosphere of this movie is wonderful. And it's a Roger Corman production. Bogdanovich got his start. with Roger Corman with started out he worked his way up to the ranks you know assistant director and stuff production assistant stuff and finally Corman gave him some leftover footage from real cheapy movie that he made in 63 called the terror he gives Bogdanovich some scraps from that movie and just gives Bogdanovich free rein do whatever kind of movie he wants to he just has to and also he had some some film days left with Boris Karloff and that's how the movie Targets got made which is Bogdanovich's debut film but see Bogdanovich goes back to his roots here with Roger Corman and where Roger Corman tells it is that Bogdanovich went over budget because he wanted the film to be perfect and well he succeeded in the offensive in your perfect film you know there are some flaws you know holes here and there but you know what there are movies have that occasionally but some of them if it If it's got other stuff to cover it up, the holes aren't as noticeable, which in this case in this movie, they're not that noticeable. But all in all, you know, aside from, you know, Corman, he's real strict on budgets. But all in all, Bogdanovic delivered a great film here, and you know, Gazzard has displayed great acting skills in this movie. And it is definitely must see for anybody that and Re-released a bunch of Corman movies and they still are I think all the main ones that he did have been released but hopefully this one gets some form of rejuvenation on DVD and Other than that the it's just a great movie that that I thoroughly enjoyed and That's about all I have to say on Saint Jack and be sure and check out the blog film now and forever dot blog Logspot.com to find out about other films that aren't as well known or that just should be known that kind of got lost to the sea of the Abyss that is cinema nowadays So that's it","I'm Ethan Griggs and I'm here to talk about the film I stumbled upon this all coincides with a blog that I've got called film now and forever blog spot calm Anyways the film that I stumbled upon is a film by Peter Bogdanovich called st. Jack and it stars been Gazra who recently passed away in on February 3rd and The film centers around the character of Jack flower is an American living in Singapore who runs a whorehouse and it follows the tracks his adventures through Singapore as he gets muscled in by the local you know Singapore mafia and his involvement later through the movie with the government you know all to do with you know whores and scandals and stuff like that but you know the film is completely senator it's a big character vehicle for Ben Gazer and in a lot was a big hit for BBS, but that's another story. And you know, follow that up with several hits like What's Up Doc and Paper Moon. And, but after Paper Moon, he kind of just went in this downward slope of crap movies. But St. Jack is very different from that. This is a very, very energetic film. And it is a wonderful film. performance from Ben Gazzard. I mean the guy just shows excellent acting skills in this film and it's the whole movie you just realize how badass Ben Gazzard is. He has no idea what he's gonna do next and it's just amazing to watch. It also stars Den Home Elliot from the Indiana Jones movies and the one-time James Bond George Ladsdenby has a small role as a dirty politician. And, you know, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and money be one of them. and opening night and they would later go on to do several films throughout the 70s and 80s and in the 90s he started a lot of independent films like Vincent Gallows, Buffalo 66 and which is a very good movie if you're familiar with Vincent Gallows work it's really the only one worth watching if you come across a movie called The Brown Bunny don't watch it it's not good and then there's he did a film for Todd Salon's called Happy Which is a great movie, but if you are overly depressed don't watch it because you're you possibly commit suicide after watching it but besides that besides that it's really great film and then of course Gazzard played the Pornographer Jackie tree horn in the Cohen Brothers classic the big Lebowski But I think the Saints Jack St. Jack stands alone as one of Gazzard's best movies And upon finding this movie we went on Netflix. They didn't have it so I went to Hastings and luckily they had it so point for Hastings and their ongoing struggle to beat out their internet competitors and Well rented it and watched it and just fell in love with this movie This the the energy and the atmosphere of this movie is wonderful, and it's a Roger Corman Production Bogdanovich got his start with Roger Corman with started out he worked his way up to the ranks you know assistant director and stuff production assistant stuff and finally Corman gave him some leftover footage from real cheapy movie that he made in 63 called the terror he gives Bogdanovich some scraps from that movie and just gives Bogdanovich free rein do whatever kind of movie he wants to he just has to and also he had some some film days left with Boris Karloff and that's how the movie targets got made which is Bogdanovich's debut film but see Bogdanovich goes back to his roots here with Roger Corman and where Roger Corman tells it is that Bogdanovich went over budget because he wanted the film to be perfect and well he succeeded in the offensive in your perfect film you know there are some flaws you know holes here and there but you know what there are movies have that occasionally but some of them if it If it's got other stuff to cover it up, the holes aren't as noticeable, which in this case, in this movie, they're not that noticeable. But all in all, you know, aside from, you know, Corman, he's real strict, he was real strict on budgets. But all in all, you know, Bogdanovich delivered a great film here, and, you know, Gazer just displayed great acting skills in this movie. And it is definitely a must-see for anybody It's that it is interesting seeing a good move and definitely check it out and Hopefully the film Gets re-released the DVD that I've viewed was not the best quality you want from a DVD up to the standards of today and You know Criterion's a long shot for this one, but the shout factory is having a they Re-released a bunch of Corman movies and they still are I think all the main ones that he did have been released but hopefully this one gets some form of rejuvenation on DVD and Other than that the it's just a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed and That's about all I have to say on Saint Jack and be sure and check out the blog film now and forever dot blog Logspot.com to find out about other films that aren't as well known or that just should be known that kind of got lost to the Sea of the Abyss that is cinema nowadays So that's it"

Some people may be familiar with Road Kill Couture from the press or from Brighton Fashion Week from last year, but some people may not. I'm very passionate about this project and it's important to me that people understand where we're coming from with this. It's actually a conceptual art piece, it has lots of layers to it, but in the practical form it's a collection of clothes that are made up of pelts and feathers of animals that we have been able to salvage really from everyday life. We have various sources that we get our animals from. The first and most obvious source is Roadkill. Animals that have been unfortunate victims on the road. We either find them ourselves or people bring them into us. We get phone calls in the shop that somebody spotted something on the road and we'll go out and get it. Another source is our food chain. You can go to the supermarket and buy a faceless chicken, a little cellophane wrapped square of pink but that was actually a bird that had plumage and a skull and things that we actually find very beautiful. You can also buy rabbits from the butcher. The old fashioned butchers are unfortunately dying out. Nobody wants to be confronted with death anymore. Another source are animals that have been called as pests. We have a few gamekeepers who agree with what we're doing and part of their job involves culling certain animals and we occasionally get given things. that they would normally have burned on the bonfire. And I suppose the last source are animals that have just died of natural causes. I have to add that we never pay anybody for any of the things that they bring in. It's all donations. We are really thankful. I'm very passionate about what I'm doing. I believe in it wholeheartedly. I process all the animals myself. I skin them myself. I tannel the hides myself. This is our workshop. We do everything here. It's a very honest project, a very ethical project. If I couldn't find any animals, I would stop doing it. I wouldn't allow anybody to kill anything for what we're doing. It's very important that everybody knows this. So that's what I wanted to say and there's anyone being left and that is enjoy the show and thank you for listening."

De Laey schreef ik:  ""De West-Vlaming Omer Karel De Laey uit Hooglede overleed reeds op 33-jarige leeftijd (1876-1909). Weer één van die  veelbelovende talenten die veel te vroeg verdween. Hij schreef behalve proza, ook beschrijvende poëzie die bijna steeds gekenmerkt wordt door een fel gekleurd lokaal Vlaams taalgebruik.  Het geeft zijn werk iets charmants, maar heeft natuurlijk het nadeel dat sommige woorden niet voor iedereen duidelijk zijn.""  Dit  geldt ook voor 'Kermis'. Waarom ik er een 11 juli-gedicht van maak? De ruiter met de gele vlag met zwarte leeuw zegt alles natuurlijk maar 11 juli was in De Laey's tijd nog geen echte feestdag. Nu laat ik mijn verbeelding een beetje gaan en ik stel me voor dat dit gedicht, dat gepubliceerd werd in 1905, wel eens geschreven kon zijn naar aanleiding van de Hoogleedse kermis van 1902 en dat daar op 11 juli een beetje aandacht werd besteed aan de zeshonderdste verjaardag van de Guldensporenslag. De 'peerdeman' met de 'geluwe' vlag met zwarte leeuw was misschien onderdeel van de viering. Als het inderdaad De Laey's bedoeling is geweest om een gedicht te schrijven voor 11 juli dan heeft hij het zeer vernuftig in elkaar gestoken: de titel verwijst in niets naar die datum. De eerste strofe geeft wel een aanwijzing maar de volgende drie strofen verleggen de aandacht naar de kermis zelve. Maar dan komt de laatste strofe en daar wordt het duidelijk: het moet 11 juli zijn! Was dat De Laey's bedoeling? De verrassing tot het laatst behouden? Wie zal het zeggen? Ach, ik weet het niet natuurlijk maar is het geen leuk idee voor een 11 juli 2012, de zevenhonderdentiende verjaardag van die historische gebeurtenis?","juli, Omer, Laey, Karel, Poëzie, Kermis, 11, de",605,3,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/0jre-YXL5j4.mp3,"Het was in juli, langs de straten een pereman te vluchtte reed, Door de zonne met een vaandel dat zijn plooien opensmeed. Het zot gebubbel van de bijaarbanden En rond een torentop droeien bende duiven Schroefwijs in de blauwen hemel op. in het lommer van een kriekelaar. Altvolk in dicht te drommen, dans te zingend om, en sprong dat het sand met dikke wolken langs de boom te zwemmen on. En de perde man van verre door het stof en doord geschreeuw, zo is een geeluvaandel weg en weer met een zwarte leeuw.","It was in July, along the streets, a horseman was riding the flight through the sun with a flute that was throwing its blue open. The dark bubble of the bay-arbonne and round and round on, red banded dunes, shrieking in the blue sky. Children with their crisscrossed nails, a crooked v-tail was standing. In the mud of a warhead, all people in close dreams Dancing, singing, dancing, and jumping that sand With thick clouds, instead of swimming a tree. And the man of far, through the dust and through the writing, Swoosh a yellow flag, away and again, with a black lion."

I'm devastated So my friend Wayne comes to me and he says We'll go out new year's Eve. We go to a whole bunch of bars. We'll drink a whole bunch of drinks We'll get messed up. We'll have a great time So we started out that evening at the 7s on Charles Street in Boston and into the evening we become aware that a young woman has come into the bar alone And she's going up to all the strangers, all the couples and the pairs and the groups and she's introducing herself, she's chatting with them for a while and then she's moving on. Well pretty soon she gets her way on to Wayne and I and we got by her a couple of drinks. Now I have no idea what she looked like, I have no memory of that at all. But I do remember this sort of vivacious energy she had. Well Nuiya Ziv comes and goes with the usual fanfare and she says she feels like going dancing so we go across down to a disco. And she and Wayne hit the floor together because I just didn't feel like dancing that night. Instead I go to the bar and I start buying everybody around it, around the drinks. Well, it's last call, the lights come up in the bar and across from me on the wall there's a mirror and I look at myself in the mirror. I'm wearing these sort of baggy black pants and this ugly brown sweater. And I'm sort of slouch-tough in this bar chair almost as though I can't fully commit to being completely on or off the chair. I just look like someone who had given up. But I can't think about this for too long because she hustles it out the door and down the street to a gay bar. And this place is packed. And the music is pounding away. And she and Wayne hit the floor again. I go lean against the bar and I'm looking around to see if any of the guys are checking me out. Because I just sort of like the attention. But pretty soon she's got us out of there. And we head down to the combat zone to the naked eye. And Wayne by now is asleep. on the bar, and she's jamming away with the bartender, and I'm watching the action, but that we close that place and then we're across the street in a porno theater. Now Wayne's still asleep, and she and I start making out. But before I know it, it's right on the sidewalk. The sun is coming up. So we head to my place, and Wayne crashes on the couch, and she and I get into bed together. And I make love to the, for the first time in seven years to a woman other than my wife. And it's absolute heaven. Fall asleep, we make love again, and that night we go out to another disco. Only now I feel like dancing. I feel invigorated, I feel renewed. I feel like an entirely new person. We danced until two, and we took her home. Now on the way, she and I didn't discuss about seeing each other again because I think we both knew that this was just a one night stand. As a matter of fact, she asked me to drop her off at the corner of Arlington and Beacon Street, and she disappears around the corner. corner like a mirage. So we're driving up Beacon Street, where the only car on the road is two inches of freshly fallen snow on the ground and everything's muffled and you feel like you're floating.

So I came and auditioned as an actor and then they said oh you've got lots of good ideas, do you want to produce a show? And so then I started producing. When I was thinking about Eunys to go to, my friend up in Queensa actually told me that RMIT has their own production company and so that's one of the main reasons that I came here. After doing a bit of work here at RMIT, sorry, the studio for a course at my lecture, I thought it would help you about it. And then a mate and I just decided to join and we'd seen the office. I sort of walked around a couple of times, signed up and then they said, oh yeah, these productions are on. Went to the shoot and just did stuff. passionate about media and all the great things that can come from a media career. I love it how it's just volunteer based and there's a lot of people wanting to help you out and there's always someone there to help you and if you don't have a question if you don't have the correct way of dealing with something there's always someone just not dumbing things down to you just kind of explaining things the way it should be. I like that it's a great way to gain experience in the industry and it's full of students so everyone's starting out so it's okay if you don't know anything everyone will teach you I like that basically anyone can just join and start making television and have the opportunity to sort of do whatever you like in terms of making your own TV show. And yeah, you meet a lot of like minded people, which is really cool. Everyone is there to make television and have fun while doing it and learn something and possibly make a career out of it. So you meet a lot of people just like you, which is really cool. Oh, definitely looks good on my CV. Definitely the act of actually directing and actually having roles like that helps and almost anyone can do it which is what I think it makes it even even more important to an everyday life. People just have no idea it comes in and just jumps on a graphics machine and that's their first role and that's where they start and then they turn out to be really experienced by the end of like even one year they turn out to be like probably better than in the field. and I can say look you know I've produced this many hours of television. I've done this crew role several times and hopefully it will help me get a career and as I said it's I'm also meeting people that I want to work with in the future if I'm in the sort of position where I need to employ someone, even what chances are it will be someone I've met through RITV or maybe vice versa that I'll try and get me a job and I think that's very important especially in the entertainment industry. in front of the camera. So I've worked since working at RMITB. I have worked as a production manager on a big German car ad with big budget and I've worked for lots of different media companies as a contractor, as a camera person, editor, production manager. I've worked as a director on different things, producer. It's really good, it's helped me. Actually one job at a green screen studio I was specifically hired because of my role at RMITB. What are you doing here? probably more passionate about it than others. Some people maybe have as more of a hobby, some people wanted it as a career, so they'll get more involved. People do kind of like it's band together. There's like an inner circle of those people. We were really, really committed to RMITV and donate heaps of time to it. There are others who just sort of on the outer kind of they sign up, they go on production, they never hear from them again. But there are definitely tribal elements I mean, there are several people who commit their time, like massive amounts of time out of their week to make sure the RMITV exists and runs and doesn't sort of collapse into a mess. So I guess if that's what a tribe is, people sort of helping each other for this one cause or for them to help other people, then maybe I guess it is a tribe.","I came here actually as an actor to get involved in Fluff because I heard that there was this TV show for young people and it was all about getting involved in youth television.

Este trabalho que tem sido feito, que eu junto com a Universidade de Ebrard é extremamente importante, os nossos técnicos do município também desenvolvem um trabalho bastante produtivo e que está agora aqui à vista. Neste caso, é estanta que está agora aqui a ser trabalhada. e e as instituições governamentais. Seria extremamente importante, porque realmente o município pequeno como o nosso, como pouco recursos, desenvolvem um esforço grande para realmente manter estas iniciativas. que tinha sido muito destruído, aqui há uns anos atrás desconhecemos exatamente em que altura e tinha sido destruído com retirar a parte da cobertura, retirar nenhum dos estaios, fizeram um buraco grande no centro da câmara que agora está columatado com pedras que nós pretendemos vir a tirar na próxima semana de se calhar. E estamos a tentar definir e perceber como é que era o aparelho de construtiva, a arquitetura do monumento. Só que temos aqui, para além de a doutora a Paula Morgado que é a quebra da Câmara Municipal de Montfort que é nossa parceira com a Universidade neste trabalho e do Sérgio Batista que também é um futuro arqueólogo aqui do Conselho que está neste momento a tirar o curso da Universidade Dévora. São alunos da Arquologia da Universidade Dévora que têm durante o ano letivo propriamente de setembro a junho a parte teórica mas sendo alunos da Arquologia também são obrigados a fazer uma parte prática obrigatória do curso e que são avaliados. Este monumento encontra-se integrado no circuito de megalitismo do Conselho de Montforte. E daí que tínhamos iniciado este projeto de escavação para conseguirmos perceber um pouco mais deste monumento do qual nada conheciamos porque não se havia sido escavado em termos científicos, em apenas sido alvo de algumas violações antigas já no século XX. É um projeto que conta então com a colaboração da Universidade de Évora e com o apoio das instituições locais que tem sido fundamental. Não só com a Câmara Municipal de Montforte, mas com os bombeiros de Montfort e também com a Santa Casa da Misericórdia. Neste momento podemos observar a crivagem de terras, provenientes de excavação, com o objetivo de verificar se existem materiais que possam ter passado, portanto, na nossa crivagem dos nossos olhos. Este projeto, esperamos terminar-lo este ano Encontre assim de grado na carta arqueológica e, portanto, ainda que terminemos as escavações na Ante do Monte Velho, será certamente continuidade durante os próximos anos. E esperemos que assim seja e que a Universidade continua a ser nossa parceira, porque é fundamental para a compreensão destes monumentos arqueológicos.","Our intention is to collaborate and improve the exhibition of this heritage, so that we can bring more people here to dynamize the council. This work that has been done, together with the University of Ebrard, is extremely important. Our municipal technicians also say that it is a very productive work and that it is now here at Vista. In this case it is so much that it is now here to be worked on. The first thing is that the government has a mega-lithic government, it's about 5,000 years old, according to the technicians. So it's one of the most important ones we have here in the municipality. It's extremely important and it would be extremely important that the level of the State Secretary of Culture, of IJESPAR, has a greater support, because at this moment the municipalities are going through extreme difficulties. So we are trying to respond to all situations, but it's extremely difficult. Things are increasingly complicated. And if there was an accompaniment, an effective support from some of the municipalities, government institutions, it would be extremely important because really a small municipality like ours, with little resources, develops a great effort to really keep these initiatives. At this moment what we are here to do is a mega-lithic monument, the funeral, the Santas served as a funeral, the deaths, or at least some of the deaths, about 5,000 years ago by the facilities of the final lithic Calculative. And what we are here to do in this monument It had been destroyed a few years ago, we know exactly what height it is. It had been destroyed by removing the cover, removing any of the stables, making a big hole in the center of the chamber, which is now covered with stones that we intend to remove next week. We are trying to define and understand how the construction equipment, the architecture of the monument, was. I'm Paula Morgado, a member of the Municipal Chamber of Montfort, our partner with the University of this work. And Seres Batista, who is also a future archaeologist here at the Council, who is currently taking the course of the University of Devere, are the students of the University of Devere's archaeology, who have, during the year, and in September, June, the theoretical part, but who, being students of the archaeology, are also forced to do a practical part, mandatory of the course and which are evaluated. This monument is integrated into the Megalithism Circuit of the Council of Montfort. That's where we started this excavation project to be able to understand a little more about this monument, which we didn't know at all because it hadn't been excavated in scientific terms. It was only part of some old violations in the 20th century. It's a project that has the collaboration of the University of Évora and the support of the local institutions that have been essential. Not only with the municipal camera of Montfort, but with the strong-walled firemen and also the Santa Casa da Misericórdia. At this moment we can observe the excavation of land, the excavation of land, with the aim of checking if there are materials that can pass through our excavation, in our excavation of our eyes. This project, we hope to finish this year, It is integrated into the archaeological map and, while we still have to finish the excavations in the front of Montevélho, it will certainly continue for the next few years. We hope that this way it will continue to be our partner because it is essential for the understanding of these archaeological monuments."

Повече за любовта и секса, съвети от д-р Врабчев на www.sexology-bg.com .","сексология, любов, възраст, Врабчев",1875,12,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/0zYZ-2zcf60.mp3,"Интересували се любовта от годините и от възръста? Този въпрос е още няколко, ще за данно доктор Ильия Врапчев, сексолог или както той предпочита да го наричат любен алока. Здравейте! Кажете, сега важна ли е разликата възръста, в една връскъ и в взаимоотношението между хора? Във случите жената да е повъзрастна в взима от мушенията като години, от мъжа. В една га моите колеги психологи, които са превържени на психоанализа, да ше кажат, ето го електракомплексът от тази жена, която търси възрастният, но ето го е дип, вие комплекс от този мъж, което търси възрастната жена. Може да са прави. Никъде във, ка сказвам, в секса няма, не може и да са. А какво щастото гледае на подобни възки? Върштават, когато видят възрастни хора да демонстрират на някоя пейка чувствато с един към друг. Как се казва, на стъпите ме е помазова. Някога когато младите се целуваха в транвая, всеки ги гледаше слоси от че сяква тук, че са обрали банк. Сега е същото с възрастните хора. Не бива така. Аз няма да я казвам и стъркан от стихна пушкина, че любовта всички възрасти са покорни. Любовта е дар бължи. И няма значения възрастата. че виждате, когато тези, които виждате възрастните, те си представат себе си на тази възраст. Има нещо, което са не забравили на последъг. У Мемли, след късма си родили децата, направили кариерата. След това да устарем за едно. Достарем за едно. От това по-хубаво не има, защото някак си човешкият път има смисъл. Начало има и край. Разбира се, че ще има край. Но до сетният си дъг да съм обичан и да бъда обичан. Като финална разговор трябва ли да и покънна любовта за възраста. И най-динья и на другия във простите. Винаги трябва да извинявате да знае, че вратите на къщата са отворени за нея. Тя е желана Гостенка, която никога не бива да си отива.","Did you care about love since you were a child? This question is still a question for Dr. Ilya Vrapchev, a sexologist, or how he is attracted to the word love. Do you think the difference between age, relationship and relationship is important now? In the case of a woman, it is more mature in the relationship of age, in husband. One day my colleagues, psychologists, who are involved in psychoanalysis, will say that this is an electro complex from this woman, who is looking for her age, you know. This is a deep, you know, complex from this man who is looking for his age. He can do it. Never, in what I say in sex, there is no, there is no. and there is no norm. The original souls. What does the existence of such a city look like? Unfortunately, it's bad. Bad, bad, bad. No, bad is in this moment that we are being pressured. This is what our human being, especially the Bulgarian, is being pressured. What will others say? What do people are happy about? Why are we running? Well, they are there where they don't need to. Love is only for young people. It is nice to see many young people who are killed, killed and all go around the street. And some young people They are proud when they see older people demonstrating their respect to each other. As they say, they are helping me. When I was young, I was kissing them in the tram, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they were looking at me, they The same country between two ages, after 50 and 60 years of age, is blessed with a lot of humility and many of them wish for the next years to be in the same relationship with their partners, and for other young people, it is decided as a ceremony or that they are already at this age for what kind of love can be said. When the young people see you, they represent themselves at this age. There is something that we forgot about later. We were born and raised as a child. We made our career. Then we became old together. We became old together. There is no such thing as a good relationship. Because some of you have a point of view. There is a beginning and an end. It is clear that there is an end. But you have to be used to it. As a final conversation, should people be afraid of love for their children? And find love and others in the present? I have to show them, I have to apologize, to know that the doors of the house are open for them. They are a desire of a guest who never was to leave."

Sheriff's office, are you on the line? Yes, we are. Do you need us to go with you? He said somebody can't have these heart-ache. I have my God damn medicine this morning. I ain't got no medicine. I went through the fucking hospital and the doctor got mad because I told him that white boy, you should fuck my mama a long time ago. Sir, are you in pain somewhere? Yes, I got headaches in my leg and they were saying I'll be in the fucking fight. So you want the paramedics to come and check you, correct? Well, I thought you were getting what the hell going on. Sir, you need to calm down and talk to me. I am trying to help you and I'm trying to send the paramedics, but I need to understand. I don't know what the problem is. Okay, but you're feeling head pain, is that correct? I mean, yes, I've been injured. I've been hit on the head and everything else. How else do a mother-butt be a shock? All right, when did that happen? Yesterday. Damn! My head is hurting. You're gonna sit in my head and you're gonna fuck around on the phone. Sir, I have no problem sending you help, okay? The paramedics will come and they'll check you. How old are you? I'm 62 years old. I was born in the United States. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What apartment number are you in? I ain't got no goddamn apartment. It's a town. What kind of medical history do you have, sir? I don't know. Let them check it out. I ain't no fucking doctor. I ain't no nurse either. You're used to that, yes, you are now. What's your name? I'm Rev. Lowdown. And what's the phone number that you're calling from? I don't know what it is. I gave you the guy that magic, that's enough. We definitely need you to go with us. We're on our way. What was like what? One of Jesus' children. Okay, what's his skin color? I don't know. I don't see no color. Do you know what color clothes he's wearing? I don't know. The butterfly's in the house. Okay, so we have somebody come see you, okay? All right. Good bye. All right."

Being overweight is something many of us suffer from. You are not alone, whether you have a little bit of puppy fat or physically obese, both your mind and your body are affected. Whilst losing weight is something that should be done from a health point of view, often people want to lose weight because it will help their self-esteem. The thing that most don't understand is that their self-esteem comes from what you think about yourself and not what others think about you. In everyday life we are greeted with pictures of stiff-in models and gorgeous glamorous actors and actresses. This can make us feel inadequate and unattractive and we often find ourselves delighted when we see in pictures of stars without makeup and think to yourself, wow, she looks bad without a slap on just like I do. In this video I'm going to walk you through a simple technique that you can use to make yourself feel more attractive and confident as a person. Whilst it does not take away the fact that being overweight is unhealthy it can help you to feel more comfortable in your body. I want you to go and stand in front of a mirror. What you are going to do is reprogram your mind to associate your reflection with positive feelings. Very soon you will be able to stand in front of the mirror and feel great rather than feeling down about your appearance. I want you to think back to a time when you felt really good about yourself. It doesn't have to be about the way you look. it might have been a job you did well, a compliment you received, anything which gives you that self satisfying glow in your stomach. Close your eyes and think of that moment. Really remember how proud of yourself you felt. Remember that in a confidence. If it was from a compliment someone paid you, remember their sincerity. Feel the glow. Move it up from your stomach to your eyes. Feel the glow behind your closed eyes and smile to yourself. remembering that moment. When you start to feel as strongly as possible, open your eyes. See yourself as other people would have seen you when you had done that great job or got that great compliment. See yourself with respect and with admiration. Keep smiling at yourself and notice the confidence in your eyes. When you really feel great, squeeze together your thumb and forefinger. This will create an emotional connection between the way you feel at that moment and your reflection. I want you to practice this every day for a month, every single day. It takes a matter of minutes and it costs nothing. Over a period of time you will notice a dramatic change in yourself. You will notice you have more confidence when you look in the mirror, your self-esteem will grow and quickly you will not worry about your weight as much as you've done before. It is very important you understand that this technique is not to replace your diet program, this is merely a way for you to start to feel better about yourself. As I've said often people want to desperately lose weight because it will make them feel more confident. By using this technique you can become more confident in the way you look within a month. Couple this with a diet program that works and your results will be both visible and internal and result in a new improved youth. yourself can result in comfort eating. This of course can only end up with you putting on more weight and the vicious circle continues. Use this technique to develop the right mental toughness and attitude and use your dieting to get into great shape.","Loving yourself, the free weight loss supplement.

Even for a hockey fish that's a lot of stagnant water and metal pools. I'm thinking an outbreak of mosquitoes is going to make it quite exciting viewing now isn't it?

So I used cutlery, but after a while it really began to hurt my bum. I think though, for the Commonwealth Games, this presents a unique opportunity for boxers.

Segundo a polícia, a mulher convencia gestantes em comunidades pobres a entregar os filhos com a promessa de dar uma vida melhor às crianças. Maria José Rodrigues, de 53 anos, foi detida nesta segunda-feira por agentes do DEC. Ela foi flagrada no momento em que recebia uma menina recém-nascida das mãos da mãe, uma adolescente de 17 anos. O esquema começou a ser investigado em março policiais da delegacia de Montes Claros, em Minas Gerais, onde ela tentava obter um bebê. Por meio de escultas telefônicas, eles descobriram que a intenção era vender a criança na Itália, onde a mulher mora com o marido italiano. Como encontrou melhor oportunidade aqui em São Paulo, ela desistiu e veio para a região de Parelheiros, na zona sul, onde identificou a menor grávida. A equipe Mineiro avisou os agentes do DEC que passaram a acompanhar os encontros de Maria com a jovem mãe. A entrega foi combinada para ontem, momentos após a criança ter a alta do hospital, onde ficou por 15 dias devido a complicações pós-parto. O flagrante ocorreu no Jardim das Embuias após a mulher receber a menina das mãos da mãe. Maria foi autuada por subtração de menor. E a garota, que negou saber que a filha seria vendida no exterior, foi encaminhada à Fundação Casa. A criança ficará sob os cuidados de funcionários do Conselho Tutelar. A polícia vai tentar agora identificar outros envolvidos no esquema.

According to the police, the woman convinced the people in poor communities to deliver the children with the promise of giving a better life to the children. Maria José Rodrigues, 53, was arrested on Monday by the DECA agents. She was flagrantly flattered when she received a new girl born of her mother, a 17-year-old. The scheme began to be investigated in March police from the Montes Claros police station in Minas Gerais, where she tried to get a baby. Through telephone calls, they discovered that the intention was to sell the child in Italy, where the woman lives with the Italian husband. As she found the best opportunity here in Sao Paulo, she gave up and came to the Paraleiros region in the southern area, where she identified the minor serious. The team told the DEC agents that they followed Maria's encounters with the young mother. The delivery was combined for yesterday, moments after the child had the high hospital, where she stayed for 15 days due to postpartum complications. The flagrant ran into the garden of the imbuyas after the woman received the girl from the mother's hands. Maria was hired for a minor subtraction and the girl, who denied knowing that the daughter would be sold abroad, was sent to the Casa Fund. The child will be under the care of the tutelage council's employees. The police will now try to identify other involved in the scheme. Paulo Edson Fiore, Young Pão Online."

Fund Growth for Tomorrow, Primarica, a name to remember. Produced Friday, October 16. Our panelists are Mary Farrell, Lewis Holland, and Martin Zweig. Tonight's special guest is Alan Sinai, Chief Economist and Managing Director, Sherson Lehman Brothers. Good evening, I'm Lewis Rue Kaiser. This is Wall Street Week. Welcome back. The stock market we are told is always delivering a message. is knowing how to read it. Well, this week no great cleverness was required to catch the message coming from the stock market. That message was, hell. Last week the Dow Jones industrials had recorded their largest point loss in history, down nearly 159 points for the week. At the time it seemed extremely unpleasant. In retrospect though it is beginning to look like a joy ride. For this week the Dow crashed more than than 235 points and set a bundle of other nasty all-time records in the process. Just as a sampler to help make your weekend merry, consider these nuggets. A week ago Tuesday, the Dow took its worst one-day point hit ever, more than 91 points. It managed to beat that twice this week, climaxing today with a 108-point mauling that occurred in the heaviest day of trading in the two centuries of the New York Stock Exchange, 338 million shares. Want more? How about this? All the broader market indexes also had record point declines today. The week's trading on the big board was itself a record. And as for that long deferred correction, the Dow had not had so much as a 10% sell-off in more than three years, the index was off nearly that much this week alone. fall in 17.5% since its peak less than two months ago. Is it any wonder that a study this week reported that Americans' favorite color is blue? They must have done most of their polling in brokerage offices. But before we all turn the color of smurfs, let's stop and consider what caused all this and where we go from here. First, let's round up the usual suspects. Interest rates are moving up. development that hit stocks with a double whammy, higher rates cut into corporate profits and deter expansion. In addition, they increase the attractiveness of investments that compete with stocks. With Treasury bonds tumbling another two points this week to their lowest levels in two years, the yields on all fixed income investments are on the rise. Second, jitters over new incidents in the Persian Gulf gave already nervous traders a fresh excuse to keep on selling. Third, the political situation was scarcely encouraging. Not only the concern over leadership in both parties, but a new tax increase package in the House Ways and Means Committee that would further penalize investment and savings. Nice going, guys. Fourth, Wall Street itself seemed in disarray. From scary layoffs at two major firms to growing evidence that the mindless, computer-driven program trading of the big institutions can turn worry into panic and prudent selling into wholesale desertion. Should we then act as hysterically as the computers? Or is this one of those many times in recent years when a little perspective and a little perseverance will eventually put the wise individual well ahead of the crowd? That's what we'll be investigating tonight with my panel and with one of the most respected economists in Wall Street. First though, before we bring in First Aid, let's count the wounded. This past week in Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average made it 394 points down in two weeks. Taking flight early on when the trade deficit failed to narrow as much as expected and then thoroughly ignoring, among other things, attempted reassurances about the economy from Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The week's loss of more than 235 points to 2246.73 took the Dow below 2400. not to mention 2300 for the first time since June. The index hasn't been this low since May 22nd. And just take a look at these losses in the broader market indexes. Even our elves grew more despondent, taking their technical market index down two notches to a still neutral minus one. Do I have any consolation for you? Well, don't forget how high these averages are. Today's record point loss, for example, was on a percentage basis, only number 76 on the all-time list of bad days for the Dow. Precious metals picked up a bit for the week, close to 10 bucks for gold and 6 cents for silver, but there was no great euphoria there either. Tonight, many commentators have been saying to quote one on-air analyst that the bull is dead. Monty Swig is one who has been correctly worried about this market lately. Do you agree with that comment? Yes. But I haven't been looking for a bare market per se. I've been really in my own mind looking for a crash. But I didn't want to talk about it publicly because it's like shouting fire in a crowd of theater and there's other ways to play it. You just tilt your strategy negatively and you shut your mouth. And I think we're in the middle of something reminiscent of 1946 or 1962, which were very similar and to some extent 29, but it won't be as bad. And I think we're in the middle to somewhat beyond the middle of this break. There'll be some violent rallies though. In fact, probably early next week I expect a violent rally. But that would not change your long-term estimate that the bull market's over? Well, I don't look for a long bear market here. I only look for a brief decline, a bit of vicious one. In 1962, the damage was done in two months. In 1929, it was done in, oh, mostly 10 weeks. And I don't think it's going to drag on any longer than that here, but it just will go down more and then turn around. Some people say it's a bear market if you're off as much as 20% there now what's your definition? Well it would be a bear market but I think of the bear market 1973-74 where it's drawn out for quite a while whereas a crash is something like 46 or 62 that's over and say a month or two that's to me the difference. How should people play it? Very cautiously. You're gonna be hurt no matter whether you're bullish or bearish there's too many traps to fall into we should have a selling climax and probably two of them and after a selling climax they always go back lower so we're probably gonna have I'd say three gigantic rally's within the next month or so and and every one of them could be a trap except the last one. Of course, whenever that comes you don't know it's hard. Very well Marty in his affable way has used that nasty word crash. Do you accept that estimate? No and I wouldn't accept the estimate that the bull market is over either. Certainly we're in a correction and that's been more than obvious and I think you have to remember here that we're not dealing with real buyers and real sellers making real buy and sell decisions like in the old stock market. because you do have this computerized program trading and portfolio insurance really making these very extreme very rapid decisions. I asked you a question about that. Yes. These computers are used by large institutional investors whose money managers are paid huge sums of money to make no brain decisions that are made for them by computers. Aren't these guys overpaid? I don't think I want to answer that one. I think you guessed it. Tell us why you don't think the bull market is over. Well, I think interest rates are the real key here at these levels we'd have to see some interest rate relief to see the bull market continue into another leg and I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility we could see some rate declines by next year and that would certainly be a positive at these levels though I would agree with Marty we're in for some rough sledding and and the risk here really is that interest rates don't give you that relief and then you would you would continue with more of the same.

The dynamic is the following. First, you will love the person you love. The way you want it, the way you want to be accepted. Then you will tell her what you love and explain what you miss. And that's it. But the idea is that we can go through here and be loved in some way. First, we love the people who are all in our hearts. And then you will choose a song that you feel, that you have in your heart. Then she will write the message. I'm going to record the video. I'm hugging a tree. It's an opportunity for him to understand that if I get here I will ask people what I'm thinking about. For whom I'm happy, not to mention anything.

This is a quick video today in the video blog and it's about when should you give free stuff away? We hear about attraction marketing, it's where we want the people to come to us. We're trying to attract people to us instead of going running after people, bringing people up, chasing our friends and family, dragging them to meetings. You've all done that, I'm sure. You've heard about it or you've had it done to you and you don't like it. Well, attraction marketing is is when you do something, say something, do a video, show something that other people are interested in and are looking for and they find you. Now there's a myth about attraction marketing and that is that you buy all the equipment that you need, you buy expensive video recorders, you buy all the software that you need to make your videos and all the different training materials and then you give it away for free. Well, that's all that basically. No, that's not a good idea. It's pointless really. That's not how you make money Yes, there are times to give away stuff and The main way or the main time to give away stuff is in a sales letter and a sales letter video because if you think about it if somebody's looking to learn something in internet marketing or Want something for themselves. What's in it for me? That's always a good sign if you're not doing something that's going to give them something then it's not going to be of interest to somebody. If they're looking for something for themselves and in the sales letter you actually give them some great tips, some great hints, some great ideas that they can use for their business, then well, and you say right well if you pay for this product I'll be able to give you another eight great ideas and other great eight things or whatever it is. But hell yeah, I've ordered that, they've given away, this person's given away all this already in this information without me paying. What would be like if I pay for it? It would be fantastic. But make sure that they'll have to at least give you their email address in order to be able to get this information off you. And then, you know, it's free, but it's like just have the email address. And then when they've paid, then obviously you need to follow through and give them the information that they're looking for whether it's your own product or whether it's an affiliate product that you're promoting then that's up to you obviously it's great if you've got your own product to do as well it could be a little ebook and I'll talk about that in another topic in another blog after an ebook but that's the time to give away your goodies, your information obviously don't give it all away, give some good information, good usable information and then the idea is that you can offer more if they come up with the pennies. So that's one to give away for free stuff, hope that's of help. If it has please share, please comment and I look forward to seeing you in the next vlog post."

Jorge Canul Pot manifestó que como todavía está en análisis la modificación del programa de desarrollo urbano, se tiene que consensar y autorizar que los talleres puedan ser reubicados y la idea de moverlos a la zona industrial también tendría que ser gestionada con el infobir para asignarles espacios. es un plan de trabajo que se tiene que seguir, hay que seguir un procedimiento, hay que seguir ciertos lineamientos para poder llegar a aterrizar esto. Pretendemos que cuando nosotros revisemos el PDU, que cuando nosotros revisemos el PDU, nosotros pudiéramos en este momento con el consenso de la ciudadanía ya poder tener las herramientas para trasladarlos a la zona industrial. Mientras tanto, abundó el director de desarrollo urbano que los talleres continúan trabajando de manera condicionada en sus mismos lugares, totalmente apegados al reglamento del PDU. Dijo además que para que un nuevo taller pueda abrir, el interesado tiene que lograr el consenso de la mayoría de los vecinos a su alrededor. sin embargo reconoció al final que es una arduataria el estar regulando los talleres ya que muchas veces los dueños prefieren estar pagando las multas y acatar las disposiciones unos días pero después caen en las mismas irregularidades como dejar en vía pública los vehículos que tienen por reparar. trabajen en la calle y no tengan residuos peligrosos almacenados. Entonces prácticamente son conexionantes que tienen que estar cumpliendo y ya hemos hecho notificaciones, ya hemos aplicado multas, ya hemos aplicado sanciones respectivas a la gente que lo ha hecho. Cuando inician el trámite de renovación o son gente que estaba establecido y que no había pagado ninguna licencia de funcionamiento, se les deja claro y dentro de lo que es el documento que se les otorga es un uso condición Para reporteros sin fronteras, con imágenes de Eduardo Bacab informó Ricardo Mendes.","The urban development director of the municipality, Jorge Canul Pot, said that as it is still in analysis the modification of the urban development program, it is necessary to make sure that the workshops can be relocated and the idea of ​​moving them to the industrial area would also have to be managed with the infobir to assign them spaces. It is a work plan that has to be followed, a procedure has to be followed, certain lines have to be followed to be able to land this. We pretend that when we review the PDU, that when we review the PDU, we could at this moment, with the consensus of the citizens, already be able to have the tools to transfer them to the industrial zone. Meanwhile, the director of urban development has been appointed, and the workshops continue working in a conditionally conditioned way in its same places, totally attached to the PDU regulation. He also said that in order for a new workshop to be opened, the interest must be achieved by the consensus of most of the neighbors around him. The first thing we are asking is the neighborhood notice that the agent agrees that the workshop is there momentarily. It is a conditional use. It is a temporary use that is being given to them in case of those who have been working. So, it is new, it is not allowed to be used. However, he recognized at the end that it is a hard task to be regulating the workshops since many times owners prefer to be paying the fines and to cut the dispositions a few days but then they fall into the same irregularities as leaving the vehicles that they have to repair publicly. We have a constant monitoring with inspectors in which among the conditioners that are asked is that they have the workshop clean, that they have the noise excess, it is not produced, they have a schedule to work, and they don't have dangerous residues stored. So they are practically conditional that they have to be fulfilled. We have already made notifications, we have already applied fines and sanctions to the people who have done it. When the renovation process begins or people who were established and had not paid any license for operation, it is clear to them and within what the document is that is granted to them, it is a conditional use. There is a use that can be removed at any time. This is an old problem, it is not a problem right now, it is a problem that has constantly been given. People prefer to make a little mess and start working and the authority is fighting for this, it is part of the work of every day. For reporteres and border guards, with images of Eduardo Bacab, reported Ricardo Mendes."

I'd like to know what you wanted to be as a child. What did you see yourself being when you grew up?

That gave way to the ambitions of wanting to be an astronaut, I thought about during a great deal of my grade school experience. By the time I got to junior high, I decided I wanted to go into broadcasting and I actually did work at the local radio station in my hometown of Hope, Arkansas and did that all the way through high school and through college and grad school and kind of thought that's what I would end up doing and particularly some form of Christian broadcasting which I ended up doing a lot of broadcasting and became a pastor. a pastor and different communities started a couple of local television channels, so I was able to keep all of those things. I always had an interest in politics, and so in a way, all of the things that I've ever wanted to do, except being a trash man or an astronaut, I've been able to pretty well do, all there were a lot of people that would probably say that in politics, you deal with a whole lot of trashy things, and they might say that if you run for office, you really are pretty well out of this world. So Paige, in a way, I guess, I've lived through all of them and I hope that answers the question.","Here's an interesting question that comes to me from Paige Sather.

There have been articles talking about how the music industry made a big mistake in killing off the single and trying to force people to buy full albums on which they only liked one or two songs. That's big business for you. And it was talking about how illegal downloads were only feeding a consumer desire, a demand for singles, for songs that people liked without having to spend $18 on a full album. And the record industry has been behind the times the whole way anyways in adopting new technology so it's no surprise that they think that they have to hold on to the CD. But really all they need to do is open their minds. If they would just realize that we only wanted a couple songs and provided those songs at a higher quality with no DRM, we might buy them.

Did you know that straighter teeth can also affect your overall health? Crooked or misaligned teeth, also known as malocclusion, affects 74% of American adults. Left untreated, crooked teeth can lead to periodontal disease and create abnormal amounts of stress on teeth and jaws, which can lead to premature wear. The effects of crooked teeth can worsen over time and may adversely affect to your overall health. Common types of misalignment include crowding, spacing, deep bite, open bite, cross bite, edge to edge bite, and excessive overjet. Crooked teeth can affect your bite, creating unnatural stress and pressure leading to premature wear. Teeth that are subject to excessive pressure can develop chipping and notches at the gum line. Over time, the excessive force may also cause flattened or worn-down teeth, or chipping and fractures at the edges of teeth. Additionally, a bad bite may produce improper forces on the jaw joint that may lead to pain in the jaw, earache, and even headaches. Premature wear can lead to gum recession, poor bone support at the roots, loose teeth, and eventually tooth loss. Teeth that fit together correctly last longer and are likely to need less costly dentistry in the future. Crooked teeth can affect your periodontal health because it's difficult to remove plaque and bacteria from the crowded areas. Bacteria that is not properly removed will multiply and trigger periodontal disease, which begins as gum inflammation, redness, and bleeding while brushing and flossing. If left untreated, over time, gum inflammation will progress to chronic infection, soft tissue damage, receding gums, periodontal pockets, bone loss, and eventually tooth loss. These conditions can lead to painful repair and maintenance in the future, which could amount to thousands of dollars in expense and countless hours in the dentist's chair. Problems in the oral cavity are best treated in the early stages. Crooked teeth that are left untreated can trap bacteria that damage gum tissue cells and invade blood vessels. This can cause damage to cells that line your coronary arteries, your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other illness. Correctly positioning your teeth for proper alignment and function will help prevent future dental problems and make a significant difference toward a healthy mouth and keeping your teeth for life. Ask your doctor in hygienists today about Invisalign, a series of clear aligners that are custom made to gradually move and align your teeth. And start on the road to a healthier you today.","Everyone knows that straight teeth give you a beautiful smile. Did you know that straighter teeth can also affect your overall health?

Emys orbicularis turtles prefer to live in wetlands surrounded by a large proportion of natural, wooded, landscape. European pond turtles are usually considered semi- aquatic, as their terrestrial movements can span 1000 meters, and occasionally found traveling up to 4000 meters, away from the water. These turtles eat a  mixed diet of plants and animal matter, that can increase the efficiencey of their digestive process. Although it is assumed that Emys orbicularis turtles are strictly carnivorous it seems that not all Emys orbicularis are entirely carnivorous as their diet also consists of plat material. Most freshwater turtles lay their eggs on land, typically near a water body, but some species of Emys have been found to lay their eggs distances less than 150 meters from water. Climate has an effect on the survival of Emys orbicularis hatchlings. Hatchlings are only able to survive under favorable weather conditions but due to regular annual clutch sizes and long lifespan, Emys orbicularis adults , along with many freshwater turtles, balance out loss of hatchlings due to climate. Life span is 40-60 years. They can live over 100 years but it is very rare and unusual.",,217,6,2,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/3wFl-n1j-D8.mp3,"Over, center, surrounding, proportion, landscape","Over, center, surrounding, proportion, landscape"

Кое-что про защиту уничтожения? 12 сентября в научно-исследовательском институте им. Александра Васильевича Вишневского увидели. В авиакатастрофах бывают травмы, не оставляющие современные медицине не единость зацепки для спасения. Самолет ЯК-42, на борту которого находился основной состав хоккеймекоманды локмотив 7 сентября потерпел крушение недалеко от Ярославского аэропорта Тунышна. Самолет не смог набрать высоту, зацепился крылом за мачту радион МАЭК, рухнул на землю и загорелся. И 45 человек, находившихся на борту, 43 погибли на месте. Пять дней спустя в больнице скончался хоккеист Александр Галимов. Борт-инженер Александр Сезов, переведенный из реанимации в обычную палату. Врачи оценивают его состояние, как средне тяжелое. Причина катастрофы еще не выявлена. Самая свежая версия ошибка пилотов. Молни перевели двигатели на взлетный режим вот и разгоняли слишком долго. Впрочем, лётчиков всегда обвиняют, пока не выявлены технические причины лётного происшествия. Ну и технику подозревают. Так президент Федерации Хоккея России Владислав Александрович Третьяк заявил, российская сборная больше не будет летать на ЯК-42. Росовиация всерьёз рассматривает возможность закрытия воздуха для этих машин. Это уже привычно. в Сургуте на летном поле сгорел ТУ-154. После катастрофы, в результате которой погибли три человека, были приостановлены полеты самолётов этой модели. А 20 июня под Петрозаводском при заходе на посадку в сложных метеоусловиях разбился ТУ-134. 47 человек погибли. После катастрофы президент России Дмитрий Медведев приказал вывести данную модель из эксплуатации. Долговечный. Правда, наши моторы пока шумнее и прожорливые западных, но и тут виден прогресс. Если отвергнем нашу технику, придется срочно, а потому дорого, покупать за рубежом машины бывшие в употреблении. Новых просто не хватит. А главное, без сбыта запчастей заглохнет вся отрасль. Это и по боевой авиации ударит, и по космонавтике. Сергей Павлович Королев старался использовать в ракетах авиационные приборы, а не отложенные обширным опытом. использования наши ракеты все чаще падают не потому ли что вместо родных ту и як мы все чаще покупаем боинги с аэробусами надеюсь следующий раз еще что-то расскажу","Hello. Something about the destruction of the protection. On September 12, in the scientific research institute, the name of Alexander Vasilievich Vesnevsky, you saw. In the air of disasters, there are injuries, which do not leave modern medicine the uniqueness of the catch for salvation. The plane Yak-42, on board of which was the main composition of the team of locomotives on September 7, suffered a crash near Yaroslavsky airport Tunish. The plane could not reach the altitude, clenched the wing for a match to the radio Maieka, broke on the ground and burned. And 45 people who were on board, 43 died in place. Five days later, a hockey player Aleksandr Galimov ended up in the hospital. The board engineer Aleksandr Sezov was transferred from the reanimation to the usual ward. The doctors assess his condition as a medium-heavy. The reasons for the disaster are not yet revealed. The freshest version of the pilot's mistake. The plane was transferred by the engine to the takeoff. The Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force is a very strong fighter, but the Russian Air Force After the disaster, three people were killed and the plane was stopped. On June 20, when the landing was in a difficult condition, 234 people were killed. After the disaster, the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, ordered to take this model out of the operation. Our planes are no less reliable than foreign ones. The same is true for long-term. However, our engines are still noisy and noisy in the West, but progress is seen here. If we turn back our technology, we will have to buy foreign cars of the former consumption, which are too expensive. But they are simply not enough. And the main thing is that without excess parts, the whole industry will collapse. This will also hit the military aviation and the cosmonauts. Sergey Pavlovich Korolev tried to use aviation devices in the rockets, and they are lying on the vast experience of the use. Our rockets are falling more and more often. Is it not because instead of native Tu and Yak, we buy Boeing with aerobuses more often? I hope next time I will tell you something else."

Для себя не наш же это сделано. и тот знак, который раньше был в исправном состоянии говорил водителю о том, что он должен пропустить машины, которые едут по главной дороге сейчас этого знака как такового нет вот и получается, что мевача-то может привести к аварии о том, что кунгурские молодожены навешивают на счастье замки на Сувинском мосту мы говорили вам неоднократно как видите, вставляют их в специальные отверстия но как быть, если они закончатся? выход нашли тут же сейчас получилось целая гирлянда из замков если обратить внимание например вот это свадьба была 24 0 8 в прошлом году а вот это свадьба уже 28 10 того же года получается что мелочи это сейчас разрастающаясь","Now I want to show you how people get to the bus stop at the UPM. In the unarmed view, the territory near the stop is not cleaned. The same applies to the fact that it is under the roof. I think that the work of the commuter is not good. The stop is in the snow. The seat is for elderly people. But for this place you need to prepare, mix snow and only after that you can sit down. I think you understand, the ground is wrong. I beg your pardon for the expression that I will say now, but I think you need to be a complete moron to take and bend the road sign. And the sign that used to be in the right condition, said the driver that he must pass the cars that are driving along the main road. Now this sign is not like that. And it turns out that the girl can bring the car. About the fact that the Kungur youth hang on the happiness of the castle, on the Syvinsk bridge, we have told you many times. As you can see, they leave them a special hole. But how to be if they end up? Now the whole of the castle has been completed. If you pay attention, this wedding was held last year in 2008. And this wedding is already on the 28th of the same year. It turns out that the young people are now growing up."

I apologize if they look like chicken scratch. consumer can make educated decisions when buying for you and your family. Genetically modified foods, or GM foods, began appearing in stores in 1994. You may be asking yourself, what are GM foods? I'm not talking about general mills or cereal. I'm talking about foods that have been altered on a genetic level. The first of these altered foods and plants was a tomato. Then there was cultivation widespread, which led to to our current startling ratio, which is 70%. 70% of all foods and grocery stores are said to have genetically modified products or byproducts in them. Deborah Whitman calls these plants, plants that have been modified in a lab to enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to insecticides or even improved nutritional value. These crops are used for food and food ingredients as well as vaccines and medicines. These easily grown crops could also reduce if not eliminate world hunger. But let's take a step back. In 1992, the first genetically modified plant was grown. It was a tomato created by Calgene. They called this plant the flavor saver. The FDA okayed this plant for consumption even though there was only short-term testing. They also okayed the lack of labeling that was necessary for companies producing this product. Even though European countries had strict regulations. Ironically enough, the flavor saver was taken off the market because of lack of flavor, but was later used for canning products. After the tomato type died down, in 2000 widespread cultivation of genetically modified foods arose over 40 countries, according to Arlene Holloman. Over the six continents, the United States was the largest producer. As seen in this diagram, which I'm going to come a little closer, 68% of all genetically modified crops grown in 2001 took place in the United States. Following the United States was Argentina with 22%, Canada with 6%, and China with 3%. Of these genetically modified crops, most of them were made to be in the United States. insecticide resistant. This made these plants very durable. So if you can imagine, think of a farmer who has to spray his entire field with insecticides. There's a delicate balance there that if he doesn't meet, he will either one, spray too much and kill his plants, or two, spray too little and still have bugs. These genetically modified crops allowed more insecticide to be sprayed with less death of the plants. This also brought us to a higher yield of product. With less bugs, viruses, and drought to fight against, the plants produced more and the farmers made more. The major crops in the 2000s were soybean, corn, cotton, canola, and sweet potatoes. These crops absolutely took off and brought us to the startling figure of 70%. Analyst Michael Gunther recorded that this food increased 25-fold in five years. In 1996 alone, 109 million acres were solely being used for genetically modified crops. That's about two times the size of the United Kingdom. The US is using more than half of the soybeans with genetically modified foods. They're covering these shelves. Produce is not the only area affected.

God damn game But but yeah, but I didn't know the effect they had on high pressure for you now Apparently there's a study. There's many studies, you know, you're gonna go on and find out that that you know, they picked two groups of people One group train only concentric training meaning you know only bringing a You know like for example in a bicep movement only bringing the ball up and then letting the ball drop the other group did eccentric training where Somebody else will help them bring the weight up or they'll use momentum to bring the weight up meaning barely any contraction But that's you know lower very slowly and the point of the study was to find out okay You have two extremes one group is only doing concentric the only curve in the shit. They're only pushing the The other group is not doing any concentric whatsoever But mainly eccentric at the end of 12 weeks or 8 weeks I believe it was who's gonna build the most muscle and drum rolls then Okay drum rolls over guess who built the most muscle so I was scratching my ass This century group that pissed me off to be honest cuz I'm gonna get me wrong I'm gonna try to shift for the next three weeks like I said about a good in challenge thing where we have to shock our bodies for for Ref the pickup muscle and shot and shot for three weeks watch the video if you haven't I'm looking for every technique I can to make my my tracks blow up, right? You guys know I'm always gonna be hunting traps Even though everyone is saying that you just have the genetics for it. I say fuck you I'm gonna have some Johnny Justin tracks, but anyway back to the point. So I thought I was like, you know what eccentric training? Those more muscle they could center training. That's ridiculous because I mean, let's be honest man We know negatives count and then they shouldn't couple them to your workout, but who likes to I My own guinea pig as well as yours and um, but wow I'm pissed as one study that was supposed to make me happy but made me sad eccentric Can you imagine that eccentric training just negatives builds more muscle than? Concentrate it kind of makes sense to if you think about it because I said I made a video about how the dead list builds the trapezius when when you deadlifting you don't really contract Your your your tribes that just you know being trash and stuff like that and then the whole stretch overload thing You know, I mean kind of makes sense even though it's a little it's a little different but Wow I'm already thinking about my next workout.

Porque en primera instancia se ve a un objeto aparentemente cilíndrico y que de ambos lados, tanto del izquierdo como del derecho, comienzan a salir infinidad de esferas o aparentes de esferas. Y esto ha sido denominado en mi país como uno de los vídeos más importantes. Desde luego también debemos tomar en cuenta que a partir de 1991 hay una cultura por voltear hacia el cielo y hubo un grupo de personas y todavía el 2009 a partir de 1991 con el eclipse del 11 de julio que pues está interesado en videogravar todo aquello que sea extraño que sobrevuela la gran ciudad de México al igual que otras ciudades en la República mexicana y creo que con esto se demuestra que el fenómeno hombre es un fenómeno inteligente un fenómeno que sabe que en qué momento en qué instante te va a presentar. En qué localidades de México donde más más pulula el fenómeno? Pues podemos decir que prácticamente en toda la República Amicana mucho escuchado ahora de que estoy acá después de haber participado en el Consejo Congreso Internacional de Fenómeno y Ayer Capilla del Monte mucho escuchado por qué motivo me cuestionan por qué motivo México tiene tanto video de en una semana será convertido ya o se le cambiará nombre a casa o nis y esperamos que bueno contar también con la participación de varias varios investigadores en varias partes del mundo con la única finalidad de que en conjunto podamos estar videograbando el cielo tomando fotografías con una prueba de ellos lo que ustedes hicieron hace poco para que conforme vaya avanzando bueno se hace un protocolo y conforme también se vaya avanzando vamos a ir detectando ciertos patrones de conducta en estos es ok","One of the most important cases in the Mexican Republic is the UFO expulsion of spheres. A video of which is described how it works and how the UFOs manifest. Why? Because in the first instance, it is seen an apparently cylindrical object and that on both sides, both on the left and on the right, infinity of spheres or apparent spheres begin to appear. And this has been denoted in my country as one of the most important videos. Of course, We must take into account that since 1991 there is a culture to turn the sky around and there was a group of people and still 2009 from Raitero 1991 with the eclipse of July 11 that is interested in videographing all that is strange that flies over the great city of Mexico as well as other cities in the Mexican Republic and I think that with this it is proved that the phenomenon is an intelligent phenomenon a phenomenon that knows what the and we hope to have the participation of several researchers from all over the world with the only goal that we can be together recording the sky, taking photographs with a test of them that you have done recently so that as it progresses, we can make a protocol and as it progresses we will be detecting certain conduct patterns in this process.

But for me, I'm not taking either What is the purpose of Serbia? You know I'm doing a vlog This is Kostomo here in my marriage Serbia. There's a breakaway Republic and I have to say something about this to you people to all my people to all my viewers and Haters to you know, you don't like me. You don't like what I'm saying You want to be with Kostomo? You want to be with Serbia? You want to be with the with the EU? I don't care. This is what's wrong with cause of all don't touch the nose He provoked me that's what he gets dude. I'm talking about this is not a joke video She doesn't understand like this is this is like a world political situation You know I'm just building up so you people realize like I ain't joking around here This is this is not one of my comedy puppet videos satire. This is like the serious shit. Even if you're a child, whoever you are, I want you to understand history. We've had a lot of problems come out of this area of the world. Maybe it's one of the top problem areas for whatever reason. I'm not really going to go into the reasons here because they're very mystical and not provable. But history does show that a lot of of problems come out of the Balkans or the Slavic area, which is, if you look at a map, it's across the sea from Italy, which is another place a lot of problems come out of. Number one, myself and my family, my father's side, but anyhow, you got Italy and then you've got the Adriatic Sea and across that is this section of the of the world is always in turmoil. I mean, what do I want to do? Accept this? What it comes down to is the fact that the bigger world powers who are also can be a problem. Their governments can be a problem. Not their people. I mean their people are all like, you know, like me and you are. The mainstream people like I am American. I am Russian. I know a lot of Russian people. That's how you're right now. I love the Russians and they know that. I have many connections. But the thing is, their governments These really intense superpowers are looking at the Kosovo situation, the region there and one of them wants to say, it's okay, we can have this independent, we can have this new state created. And the other one wants to say, no, we can't have that, we can't have just a nation just breaking away and being created. This is not because of civil war. They have a war of a military and more of a difficult. They should not be getting into arguments about these regional conflicts because what's going to happen is it will draw everybody into conflict. And this is what started World War I. This is what started World War II. and also you're gonna have to start to talk now about trees It's not really done with it, so they call them terrorist groups. But they have never. So it's like, this is a block of power. And their guy is getting stronger. And the whole idea that people can't just get along. We got faces. We have to answer that question. Why should we have all these little gangs? And just waiting for a problem to happen. And drawing lines. And these signs are going to come into this big crash. It's very serious. I'm telling you, some of you out there, you're just so close by, and you're going to say, I'm a fool. But I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. I'm gonna tell you very soon that the end of this video, the solution that I found out, and we're gonna have to take it on faith, and it doesn't matter. Once you take it to fact, you see this is a problem, you see the possibility of wars breaking out. It's going to kill people that we know. And we're all gonna be affected. It's gonna be pollution, it's gonna be radiation. Probably coming to that, but we got sucked in that blur. It got to be able to pick up the people. And therefore you don't have to be a policymaker. Let's say you're a little policymaker, you know, but actually I am a policymaker. because you have a voice and this is what I'm trying to tell everybody once you know the facts then you can come up with an educated opinion and you can express it you don't have to just sit there feeling like you can't do anything I mean look at me look at Mr. E I mean who am I? I have a billion people in the world well I know who I am but you know much of the world doesn't know who I am but yet I know that I can express my opinion because I have a philosophy on it. I have a world view and this is how it is.","First of all, if your political stance is that you believe the nations as they are, you can't change the borders, then you don't like what's happening with Kosovo.

I have to say something about this to you people, to all my people, to all my viewers and haters too. You know, you don't like me. You don't like what I'm saying. You want to be with Kostomo. You want to be with Serbia. You want to be with the EU. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.

I'm talking about this is not a joke video She doesn't understand like this is this is like a world political situation You know, I'm just building up so you people realize like I ain't joking around here This is this is not one of my comedy puppet videos satire. This is like the serious shit. Even if you're a child, whoever you are, I want you to understand history. We've had a lot of problems come out of this area of the world. Maybe it's one of the top problem areas for whatever reason. I'm not really going to go into the reasons here because they're very mystical and not provable. But history does show that a lot of of problems come out of the Balkans or the Slavic area which is, if you look at a map, it's across the sea from Italy, which is another place a lot of problems come out of. Number one, myself and my family, my father's side, but anyhow, you got Italy and then you've got the Adriatic Sea and across that is this section of the of the world is always in turmoil. What do I want to do? Accept this? What it comes down to is the fact that the bigger world powers who are also can be a problem. Their governments can be a problem. Not their people. I mean their people are all like, you know, like me and you are. The mainstream people like I am American. I am Russian. I know a lot of Russian people. That's how I'm right now. I love the Russians and they know that. I have many connections. But the thing is, their governments These really intense superpowers are looking at the Kosovo situation, the region there, and one of them wants to say, it's okay, we can have this independent, we can have this new state created. And the other one wants to say, no, we can't have that, we can't have just a nation just breaking away and being created. This is not because of civil war. They have a war of a military and more of a difficult. They should not be getting into arguments about these regional conflicts because what's going to happen is it will draw everybody into conflict. And this is what started World War I. This is what started World War II. and also you're gonna have to start to talk now about trees I'm telling you, some of you out there are still close by and you can say, I'm going to tell you very soon that the end of this video, the solution that I found out, and we're going to have to take it on faith. We have to develop it. Once you take it on fact, you see this is a problem. You see the possibility of wars breaking out. It's going to kill people that we know. And we're all going to be affected. It's going to be pollution, it's going to be radiation. Probably coming to that. We're going to soften that blur. It's going to be able to pick up the people. And therefore you don't have to be a policymaker. I'm not saying that I'm a policymaker. I am a policymaker. because you have a voice and this is what I'm trying to tell everybody once you know the facts then you can come up with an educated opinion and you can express it you don't have to just sit there feeling like you can't do anything I mean look at me look at Mr. E I mean who am I? I have a billion people in the world well I know who I am but you know much of the world doesn't know who I am but yet I know that I can express my opinion because I have a philosophy on it, I have a world view, and this is how it is."

Sí, también es otra cosa que también los chicos de ahora empiezan con el alcohol y después de ahí ven a otros que están consumiendo y van y les piden y bueno... ¿Conocen muchas chicas que consumen? Sí, muchas chicas. Mucha chica de mujeres, digamos. También hay chicas que consumen, ven en su cuerpo, llevan sus hijos, tengo amigos que han hecho eso. O sea que se llegan a prostituir para poder pagar la droga Hay uno que consume porque le gusta, o hay otro que consume porque... Si, pero si, consume porque alguien lo vende. Claro, y esa persona no hay... Es que pasa que hay mucho dinero que hay en juego y son capas de hacer hasta... Cualquier cosa para... para vender, los que hay que vender... O sea que hay muchos adictos, conocen. Sí. Sí. Muchos chicos también. Chicos. Porque por ahí nosotros vemos y les consejo muy bien, pero ahí lo toman o no lo toman. ¿En qué ambiente vos notas que hay más consumo? Porque sobre el de gran volante que camina por todos lados. Realmente es triste, es muy triste esto. Acá es como dice él, no solo 10 años, y hace 8 años, 7 años, todavía no era lo que es ahora. Ahora está totalmente destruido todo. Hay chicos, yo conozco casi todo, me conozco y conozco. Generalmente hay curiosos también que, como el día ¿Es la misma calidad de corda que la de acá? los pobres, lo que consumen la buena es uno que tiene plata y hay mucho que tiene plata y que se esconden bueno los que ponemos la cara somos nosotros siempre, siempre no y los más discriminados y aquellos que te ven y te dicen no te pueden ver cambiar o sea no te pueden ver adelantar te discriminan y dicen el drogón te va a cambiar, te no cambia más pero uno realmente yo soy una persona y quiero y me cambia hace mucho tiempo. Este Villa de Rosario, si sigue así, para como viene gente de otro lado, viene mucha gente, mucha gente nueva, gente que viene consumiendo de otro lado y empiezan... No todas las gente es como nosotros. No le importa nada. Viene un pibes y le arrima y quiere consumir y ya entraste en esa, ya fue, te tomas una alcohol y ya no te importa más nada. En la plaza. Sentirme así estimulada, ¿certo? ¿Y qué te dicen, melodeo? Melodeo, ande melodeando para yo algo o me quieren putar algo para... ¡Bam! Quiero bronca, se llato que me quieren agallo y yo tengo un hermano preso y bueno, acá. Ahora, ¿cómo lo ves? ¿Cómo ves acá en el pueblo, en la ciudad? ¿Cómo ves el movimiento? ¿Hay más adictos, menos adictos? ¿Ya se ha generalizado el consumo en todo? O sea, las clases más humildes, las clases medias... y así. A que le da hidro a mi hijo, me da Rusia, que yo se la vendo y encima lo consumí. Bueno, el programa este creo que no merece mayor comentario con lo que han escuchado y visto es necesario ver una segunda parte. Se la proponemos para el próximo programa.","We are back with these neighbors of Villa del Rosario, who are going to tell us now how is life of the movement here in the city and if it is easy to get, it is not easy, there are many consumers, that is, a little bit of a review, to make a brief record of what it is today Villa del Rosario, I have been in contact with this addiction problem since the point of view of them that have this problem. When I came here I saw Rosario, I was here, I didn't exist. How long was that? Ten years. Ten years, the drug here didn't exist? No, I didn't exist. I knew, sit in the square, I smoked marijuana and there was always something curious. Of course, a weird guy, it was you, Jaco. Then I started to go out, I saw boys, boys, 14. 15 years of drinking cocaine, it's ugly. And where do you start? In Bali, there is something like this. In Bali, there is everything in the street, the kids in the street, the humble people, they are what they see the most, why they are in the street, who have money, they do it at home. But what they don't have money like the kids, who are curious and want to know, they buy anywhere and drink. Do you want to say something about alcohol? Yes, and also other things that children from now on start with alcohol, after that they come to others who are consuming and go and ask for it. They know many girls who consume women, say, big women. Yes, there are also girls who consume, come to their bodies, leave their children, I have friends who have done that. Yes, but if they consume it because someone sells it. Yes, and that person, I think there is a lot of money in the game and they are capable of doing anything to sell the tickets they sell. I know there are many addicts, do you know? Yes. Women, girls. Girls too. Girls. We see them and they advise us well, but they take it, we don't take it. What do you notice in the environment that you are in? Or that the ambulance is walking everywhere? It's really sad, very sad. It's not just 10 years ago, 8 years ago, 7 years ago it wasn't what it is now. It's completely destroyed. I know almost everything, I don't even know. There are also curious things. They come and ask me, and I never... I usually buy a cord, it sells a lot. And here they sell it. Is the same quality of cord here? No, nothing to see. Is it better quality of cord? Yes, much better. Talking about it here, yes they sell it, they sell quality, but it really has little money. Inexhaustible here. We are the poor, what consumes the good is what has money and there is a lot that has money and that they hide. Well, what we put on our faces is always, always not. The most discriminated and those who come and say, you can't see you change, you can't see you advance, they discriminate you, they say, the drug, what will change, you can't change anymore. But one really, I am a person and I want to change. I've been doing this for a long time. If you keep doing this, you'll have a lot of new people coming. People who come with their money from the other side and start to notice that people are like us. They don't care about anything. They come to a pub, they rent it out, they want to consume it. You came in and went to drink alcohol and you don't care about anything else. I was a little bit like that, I went out to the court, I went to court, I didn't know anything, I met people in front of the old hospital of children, and well, there I started to try marihuana. In the square? Yes, in the square. In the famous capital of the children? There I tried marihuana and then I liked it, it was sweet and in a short time I started smoking and drinking pills and so on, I feel like I'm in a hurry, right? And yesterday, my friend, who can you add? You were in jail, you felt a little bit persecuted by the police? Yes, almost always with no one, walking on the street, they charge me, they come to me for sports, they take me to the mill, they come to me, they come here to buy flowers, they take me there, they have me on the way, they give me a long way, they never give me anything. What do you say? Do you hate me? I hate you. Do you hate me for something or do you want to fuck me? I have a brother in jail and I'm going to live here. Now, how do you see it? How do you see the people here in the city? How do you see the movement? There are more addicts, less addicts. The consumption is already generalized in everything. In other words, the most humble classes, the middle classes. I have a lot of kids here, I have a lot of kids of 14, 15 years old, I can buy a face, I don't know how old I am, I don't know because I didn't go to say that I came with a panda, I got a stick in my ass and the other one and he doesn't sell me mommy, so I couldn't bring a young boy, and if the mother comes, if she catches me, I would say, give me some drugs, my son will give me an ad, I will sell it and consume it. Well, this program, I think it does not deserve more comments, with what you have heard and seen, it is necessary to see a second part. We propose it for the next program."

""Yes We Can"" is our proactive approach and I tell our team often, ""We buy nice vehicles, but we don't buy them to keep"".  :)  Thanks!    You will need to estimate three figures that will guide you as you go shopping:    Monthly payment. If you are going to take out a loan, how much can you afford to pay each month?    Down payment. How much cash can you put down to reduce your monthly payments?    Purchase price of the car. Answering the first two questions will help you determine a realistic price range for your used car.    Once you've determined how much you can spend for a down payment, a monthly payment and the purchase price of the car, print out these figures. Later, in the heat of the moment, when you are negotiating for a used car, you might need to check the card to bring yourself back to earth.      Checklist:        •Choose the right vehicle for you by making sure the car suits your needs.       •Consider all cars in the class you have chosen (compact sedan, SUV, station wagon, etc.) .      •Check it's reliability and consumer reviews. At Prestige, we'll provide you with such info.      •Decide how much you have to spend on your vehicle purchase: down payment, monthly payment and purchase price. If you are financing the car, go to the top center of this page and predetermine your ""Affordable monthly payment?"" Make your selection fit your budget. Don't let a vehicle payment strap you!      •Decide how you are going to finance your car: a bank, on-line lender or credit union. At Prestige we have many local banks, credit unions and several national lenders to secure the best possible loan for you.      •Call the seller and verify the pertinent information. Get the VIN # and run a history report on the vehicle. At Prestige, we are happy to provide you with this information.      •Test drive the car under your normal driving conditions. Preferable purchase from dealers who offers some warranty on there vehicles. Most of the vehicles come with factory or dealership warranty.      •Negotiate your best deal.

We buy nice vehicles, but we don't buy them to keep!      •Read the contract carefully before signing and always make sure you get a clean title.       •If you are trading in your old car, web site like KBB.com can give you a rough estimate of your ""Trade-in Value"".    • Once you've reached a good price, ask the salesperson to fax you a worksheet showing all the prices, taxes and fees.    •  Bring your worksheet with you to the dealership so you can compare these numbers to the figures on the contract.     •Inspect the car for dents, dings and scratches before taking final delivery.

Hoy el mixer viene a resolver muchos problemas que antes lo resolvíamos con otro tipo de las máquinas complicadoras, con distribuidores, hoy el mixer viene a hacer todo eso, pero bueno, necesita un clic en la cabeza del productor y bueno, y en eso estamos apuntando, trabajando en eso, gracias a Dios, de noviembre que presentamos el producto a fines de mayo, estamos muy bien posicionados, las ventas han movido muy bien y gracias a Dios, creemos que estamos con un producto muy noble por su construcción, por sus cajas reductoras, por sus rotores, pero también por la manera de trabajar que nosotros tenemos trabajos hechos con técnicos de linta, donde lo más importante de esto, más allá de la velocidad de trabajo que muchas veces se compite, qué mixer hoy trabaja más rápido, más lento, lo más importante de un mixer es la capacidad de desmenuzado y uniformidad de la mezcla. Nosotros creemos que tenemos esa característica y bueno y hoy en este campo lo hemos podido demostrar en las demostraciones dinámicas de mixer donde los productores han podido constatar en forma in situ bueno la calidad y la uniformidad de la mezcla que hoy en día es clave a la hora de contratar un nutricionista y los requerimientos nutricionistas son esto porque tanto en el tambor como en el feedlot no podemos no podemos desperdiciar un gramo de más un gramo de menos o un aporte de fibra más ¿Tivo como para que el productor confíe? Estamos apuntando en el mismo sentido a trabajar sobre todo con la premisa de la empresa en calidad. Hoy la empresa ya hace varios años está certificando normas iran de seguridad, de calidad, también lo está haciendo ahora con las normas ISO, con lo cual vamos en contante y permanente innovación y todo ese trabajo del departamento de desarrollo, del departamento de venta directa de fábrica se ve reflejado creemos en este tipo de productas.

When we talk about the mixer, the head, we are talking about the Acron tanks in this position. And today I would say yes, because you will know, if the people who are watching us too, that in the case of the winery we are going through a new moment, the prices close, we are in conditions of This is the time to make investments. In 2010 it was a good time, in 2011 it was also to make investments in this aspect and change our modes and our way of producing, in this case intensifying. And the mixer is like the essential tool to be able to contribute that added value that we need to intensify. Today the mixer came to solve many problems that we used to solve with other types of We are working on that, thanks to God, in November, we present the product at the end of May. We are very well positioned, sales have gone very well.

We have work done with Lintas techniques, where the most important thing about this, beyond the speed of work, which often competes, which mixer today works faster, slower, the most important of a mixer is the ability of the demenus and uniformity of the mix. We believe that we have that characteristic, And today in this field we have been able to demonstrate it in the dynamic demonstrations of Mixer where the producers have been able to see in situ the quality and uniformity of the mix that today is key when it comes to hiring a nutritionist and the requirements of nutritionists are this because both in the field and in the field we cannot waste a gram of more, a gram of less or a contribution of fiber more or less Longer or shorter, it has to be what nutrition is asking for and we believe that this mixer is in the condition to do it. We have a long trajectory in the agricultural line. ACRON is a company that is already imposed and a company that has been demonstrating with years, innovation, quality and has been demonstrating a more and more growing and permanent permanence, not only in the national market but also internationally. With this new line, the forage line, We are aiming in the same direction to work especially with the company's premise in quality. Today, the company has been certifying security and quality standards for several years. It is also doing it now with the standards made, with which we are going into permanent innovation and all that work of the development department or the direct sales department of the factory is reflected, we believe, in this type of product.

I had applied to the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine a couple months ago. They had a master's program in clinical and mental health counseling. And it was one of those schools, it was my dream school but very competitive so they don't accept many people, didn't think I'd get in. I applied just to see if I could do it but I had several other backup schools that I knew I'd get into just in case. Surprisingly enough in February I got an email. I was invited to the interview day at PCOM Very excited. I was ecstatic about it. I didn't think that was even possible, but I traveled out there for the weekend On the morning of the interview. I was very eager. I had prepared for weeks for the interview It started out there's about 20 of us in a group We had a tour we met with professors met with other students and after that part Our group was split up into about thirds and me and about six other people were taken into a very small room and Unbeknownst to us that was the group interview process. We had no idea so it was kind of a little nerve-wracking. It's scary, but we sat down and very quickly You know, I noticed that I realized this was my time to shine I needed to stick out and I tried to answer every question first and it took seconds for me to realize that I was very well advanced compared to the other students. One of the first questions was to describe some of our classes at RMU. So I described clinical psychology, individual counseling, psychological assessment, advance of normal psychology. And I realized that not one of the other girls that I was competing against had any of the other classes at all. So right away, I was kind of like, wow, I'm very well ahead of these people. And I just kept I talked about how I'm very familiar with the DSM, the psych manual.

She had me explain in depth about case studies that I've done, evaluations, personality tests, some of the stuff that she was kind of unclear on that I had that skill. And I told her that, you know, I've been doing case, I've written up numerous amounts of case studies. We've been doing it since I believe sophomore year. And she very blatantly told me that she's never seen an undergraduate student come to their interview day without kind of experience. So it was a really good feeling to impress her and I was just very cool to finally understand that our program here is very awesome. After I applied and after I was accepted I went through their curriculum their courses. I had already taken they do it in two years. years. I've already taken half of them so I'm already on the path of success in grad school because I've already taken half of them. So R&D is not lying when they say they prepare you.

I had applied to the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine a couple months ago. They had a master's program in clinical and mental health counseling. And it was one of those schools, it was my dream school but very competitive so they don't accept many people, didn't think I'd get in. I applied just to see if I could do it, but I had several other backup schools that I knew I'd get into just in case. Surprisingly enough in February I got an email. I was invited to the interview day at PCOM. Very excited. I was ecstatic about it. I didn't think that was even possible, but I traveled out there for the weekend. On the morning of the interview I was very eager. I had prepared for weeks for the interview. It started out, there's about 20 of us in a group. We had a tour, we met with professors, met with other students. And after that part Our group was split up into about thirds and me and about six other people were taken into a very small room and Unbeknownst to us that was the group interview process. We had no idea so it was kind of a little nerve-wracking. It was scary, but we sat down and very quickly You know, I noticed that I realized this was my time to shine I needed to stick out and I tried to answer every question first and it took seconds for me to realize that I was very well advanced compared to the other students. One of the first questions was to describe some of our classes at RMU. So I described clinical psychology, individual counseling, psychological assessment, advance of normal psychology. And I realized that not one of the other girls that I was competing against had any of the other classes at all. So right away, I was kind of like, wow, I'm very well ahead of these people. And I just kept I talked about how I'm very familiar with the DSM, the psych manual. I'm familiar with assessments, evaluations, case studies, personality tests, and no one else had any experience with any of that. We were also asked to describe any experience we had. And right away I described my internship that is part of our graduation requirement.

So I think the time is that, it's the continuous pleasure. Time for me is everything. It's everything and at the same moment, time means a lot. Time is the unity of the achievement of the occupations that exist for each person, each individual. Time, I think, would be a measurement of the moment, I don't know, I don't know how to define it. For me, the time is precious. Especially because I think the time is short for us to do what we have to do on a daily basis. We have to keep our time well, our goals. Because I think every day we need time to do everything we really need to do. Look, the time for me is something that has been put into our lives, just for us to have a and give a better life.

However, unlike this delivery for contract sales, the furniture in question is being submitted to a complete remodeling, so there are several citizens who have been asked what situation is it, because it has even come to mention that the sale of this land and furniture occurred at the end of last year by the municipality, before which the municipal president of Tulum clarifies that the only thing that exists is a replacement of the contract. We installed in times of the municipal president of Solidaridad, then, the Minister Miguel Ramón, won that agreement for the next 10 years or before they won it, they made a new proposal for the retirement. The only thing we did when we got there, the costs because they paid 14,000 pesos a month, we achieved to take the agreement, earning 40,000 pesos a month of rent, of the space they have, for only the time of the administration of us.

No, F no, the actor responded, which prompted the journalist to hasten on to the next topic. Shocking. In a related story on Black-White Tension, Wisconsin State Senator Glenn Grofman attacked Kwanzaa last week, opining that the holiday divides the country. An outlandish statement from the Badger State Representative suggests, quote, to be slapped down as a holiday and railed against Cal State professor and creator of Quanzimuana, Caranga, calling the esteemed scholar a violent nut to which Sam Jackson responded, inward pleas. Mr. Groffman didn't understand the statement and proceeded to down a glass of whole white milk fresh from his cow. In another melanin related story, perpetually tanned and embattled Congressman John Boehner lives to fight another day. Despite a mini revolt among Republican rank and file over the fiscal cliff deal, The wide spread public outcry over Congress' failure to vote on a multi-billion dollar emergency hurricane relief package for the Northeast. The orange-toned lawmaker was re-elected Speaker of the House of the 113th Congress on Thursday. He received 220 votes and held off challenges from all sides. But the most out of touch politician of the week award goes to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, who callously filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on Wednesday demanding that the Jerry Sandusky-related sanctions, including a $60 million fine imposed on Penn State University be thrown out. Mr. Corbett said they were overreaching and unlawful and says that they threatened the state's economy. He also believes that the stigma from the case would diminish recruitment of student athletes and that the value of Penn State education would go down. How's about the actions of Mr. Sandusky and the football program causing the stigma, Mr. Corbett? Let's just think about that for a second. I'm just saying. Last up, 15 states have reportedly launched armed teacher training programs where teachers can undergo gun training and be legally allowed to carry firearms and school Yeah, I said that.

Shocking. to be slapped down as a holiday and railed against Cal State professor and creator of Quanzimuana, Caranga, calling the esteemed scholar a violent nut to which Sam Jackson responded, inward pleas. Mr. Groffman didn't understand the statement and proceeded to down a glass of whole white milk fresh from his cow. In another melanin related story, perpetually tanned and embattled Congressman John Boehner lives to fight another day. Despite a mini revolt among Republican rank and file over the fiscal cliff deal The wide spread public outcry over Congress's failure to vote on a multi-billion dollar emergency hurricane relief package for the Northeast. The orange toned lawmaker was reelected Speaker of the House of the 113th Congress on Thursday. He received 220 votes and held off challenges from all sides. But the most out of touch politician of the week award goes to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, who callously filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on Wednesday demanding that the Jerry Sandusky related sanctions, including a $60 million fine imposed on Penn State University be thrown out. Mr. Corbett said they were overreaching and unlawful and says that they threatened the state's economy. He also believes that the stigma from the case would diminish recruitment of student athletes and that the value of Penn State education would go down. How's about the actions of Mr. Sandusky and the football program causing the stigma, Mr. Corbett? Let's just think about that for a second. I'm just saying.

This is my third video Try to give you a better view of the mods that I did first of all added a couple of decals. There's the monster. There's the hello kitty for my daughter. There's Autism awareness and there is the will cycle works, which is where I've been getting my mods done First mod that I did you can see is the rear view or the blind spot mirrors that actually does do a lot it helps I replace the sprocket with a 15 tooth from JT. It's the 516.15 and it makes a huge difference. I can do about 30 in first gear before I hit red line which is great for any commuting because I can do 8 miles an hour in first without the clutch, without holding the clutch. friction zone and it's at about 3,000 if that gives you any idea. It makes it much more tractable around. As you can see I've still got the same old fender and that's my next mod is to swap out that fender eliminator. I think it's dragging the looks down. I'm also going to take this canister locally off because the letters got messed up and I'm going to replace that with a marine decal. Another major one that I did is this right here. I don't know if you can see it but this is a 12 volt I got it from Cycle Gear. Had it installed at the same time I did the sprocket and it's watertight. It seals. It's like I think 12 bucks at Cycle Gear. It's pretty awesome actually. I still haven't changed the exhaust yet, but I'm looking at the, how do they say it? Acrope, not acropovic, it's acrope, acrapovich. Yeah, acrapovich exhaust. I'm going to do that. the titanium because I've heard some really bad things about the carbon fiber. They look really good but you've got to get the cams repacked. So that's my next mods. You can see where I hurt the ferrigs that was really stupid. I actually lugged it on a ramp going to part to get some loctite. Yes that's, don't even ask. So anyway I'm going to get that swapped out. I finally found out the part number because the place where I went to get the part told me that was out of stock and they didn't even give me the right part number and I found the part Two different places online for much cheaper than what they're offering. Anyway, well, this is the bike I'm really digging the new decals the bike just looks way more aggressive I'm not sure what I'm gonna do on the other side on one hand I want to do the same decals but in different colors But I'm thinking about just doing totally different ones on the side and but I am gonna put some marinoids on I'm gonna also gonna do the double bubble windscreen my next mods are The double bubble windscreen I'm gonna actually smoke or not smoke. I'm gonna plastic dip this a little bit and that wasn't happening. But the guys at Willis Cycle Works actually sold me those for cheaper than what I paid for the generic ones. So the pit bulls only cost me 13 bucks. So I'm pretty happy and all the work that they did they only charged me 97. And I've already had a oil change. I had that done at 280 miles. And so I'm right on my way to 600. Anyway, that's it for the bike for today. I know you guys want to hear it. So Here we go, and of course it's not a neutral so I get to look like a squid. All right. Let's try again Took it out riding today with the new sprocket it rides really good. It's much easier if this even makes sense It's much easier on the highway now I don't know if it's just the rev seemed to match the speed when I look down I'm at the speed that I think I am and I've actually GPS matched it to the speedometer and it's within a mile per hour I think I wish showing like 34 on the speedometer and I was doing 35 by the GPS and I mean I can live with that. So that's about it. Like I said not a whole lot of mods but just a couple but the bike is just going along awesome. I highly recommend it if you're waiting. As you can see if you had 250R over there this bike is a huge upgrade. They're both really good bikes but I just think this one's just going to be the much better bike in the long haul. Anyway this is iconic signing off if you have any questions just let me know or if you want to message me or ask me a question or just subscribe I'm gonna start having a little bit more videos on as I do more and more stuff and I'm gonna get a GoPro to take some moto blogging.

The smartwatch is a wristwatch that connects to your smartphone to present pertinent information so you don't have to take the phone out of your pocket. Because it takes a lot of effort to pull your phone out of your pocket, you know? The speculation about an Apple smartwatch, already referred to as the iWatch, has been running rampant for a while. Like all such rumors about Apple there is absolutely no proof that the company will produce and release a watch to the market. 100 people working on it if you believe the rumors. Just the thought of an iWatch sets the competition trembling so other companies are reportedly working on watches to take on the iWatch. That's telling given the iWatch doesn't exist. These aren't little companies either, so far Samsung, Google, and LG are allegedly working on watches to compete with the magical watch that again, doesn't exist. If that's true we may soon have the iWatch, Watch, Swatch, and the L Watch. of smartwatches on people's wrists. the watch is nowhere to be found. Sure the smartwatch will eliminate that tiresome need to pull out the phone to get the time. It can even give you the weather, show you email, present text messages, the works, all without pulling it out of the pocket. But that isn't a big benefit to most folks.

The smartwatch is a wristwatch that connects to your smartphone to present pertinent information so you don't have to take the phone out of your pocket. Because it takes a lot of effort to pull your phone out of your pocket, you know? The speculation about an Apple smartwatch, already referred to as the iWatch, has been running rampant for a while. Like all such rumors about Apple there is absolutely no proof that the company will produce and release a watch to the market. 100 people working on it if you believe the rumors. Just the thought of an iWatch sets the competition trembling so other companies are reportedly working on watches to take on the iWatch. That's telling given the iWatch doesn't exist. These aren't little companies either, so far Samsung, Google, and LG are allegedly working on watches to compete with the magical watch that again, doesn't exist. If that's true we may soon have the iWatch, Watch, Swatch, and the L Watch. of smartwatches on people's wrists. the watch is nowhere to be found. Sure the smartwatch will eliminate that tiresome need to pull out the phone to get the time. It can even give you the weather, show you email, present text messages, the works, all without pulling it out of the pocket. But that isn't a big benefit to most folks.

Since we cannot and there is no fund for the project in total, we do it on the sides.

Esta señora no se clime y cómo se llama. Estuvo ayer en el tubo de hondoyo en una de las piedras solteras. A mí no me importa, pero John Jairo piensa que podemos perjudicarte porque nos vio. Paquita, ¿tú crees que podemos perjudicarte? Sinceramente. Para nada, Esteban, no te preocupes. A mí no me importa lo que digan las vecinas con excepción de Andrés. Andrés sabe perfectamente lo que ustedes hacen. Ok, de todas maneras. ¿Tú crees que el trabajo que estamos haciendo es malo? Dime, papá. Pues, es que, sinceramente, no es lo que me gustaría para ustedes, porque yo los estimé mucho y yo quisiera que tuvieran tu trabajo. Pero yo no se los reprocho para nada, porque yo sé que ustedes no están haciendo nada en mi vida. Paquita, tú nunca te vas a decepcionar de mí de lo que estoy haciendo. Yo hago mi trabajo estrictamente. Yo sonrío, yo bailo, yo trato de agradarles a las señoras, pero no pasa nada con ella. No sé, y no tienes que explicármelo, tonto. Yo sé que yo, Jai, tú son muy buenos. ¿Para eso te quiero, tu jefe? Yo también los estimo mucho todos ustedes. Y de verdad que me siento muy orgullosa por la amistad que ustedes han dado. No los cambiaría por los vecinos, porque sé que es sin cedas. ¿Sabes qué? Yo los voy a ir a visitar porque creo que tengo que hablar con John Hacho. Pero ya vi aquí, su hija y don Andrés la están esperando en el comedor. Como siempre. Los amigos de Paca Gallego están resultando algo... especiales. ¿Por qué lo dice, ma'am? Tal vez tú lo ignores porque no tienes por qué saberlo. Pero puedes creer que el tal John Jairo y ese muchacho que la frecuentadora se dedican a bailar desnudos frente al público, no dices nada, Andrés. Es que tengo que decir algo, doña Vicky. Cada quien es libre de ganarse la vida como quiere. Yo no tengo por qué poner en tela de juicio sus actividades. Ah, entonces a ti de eso te parece muy correcto. No ves nada immoral en ello. Doña Vicky, si vamos a hablar de moralidad, tendríamos que hablar de usted. Aquí vamos a censurar. ¿Qué está de esa? La amistad vale por el aprecio, doña Vicky. No por lo que haga, no dejen de hacer. ¿Y tú crees que ellos la frecuentan porque la aprecian sinceramente? O porque ella les está pagando por su compañía. Rina, Marcela, me avises cuando estés lista para salir a pasear.","So that happened last night. That's right, Paquita. This lady doesn't know the name of the clinic. She was in the condo yesterday, in one of the solitary cells. I don't care, but John Jairo thinks we can harm you because he saw us. Paquita, do you think we can harm you? No. Don't worry, Esteban. I don't care what the neighbors say about Andrés' reception. Andrés knows perfectly well what you're doing. Okay, in any case, do you think the job we're doing is bad? Well, it's just that... Honestly, it's not what I'd like for you. Because I love you so much, and I wanted you to have a lot of work. But I don't reproach you for anything. Because I know you're not doing anything in my life. Paquita, you'll never disappoint me in what you're doing. I do my job strictly. I smile, I dance, I try to please the ladies, but... nothing happens to me. I don't know! You don't have to explain it to me, fool. I know that you're a very good dancer. I'm very proud of you. I'm very proud of the friendship you have with me. I wouldn't change it for neighbors. I know it's true. You know what? I'm going to visit them. I think I have to talk to them. So, Yaviki, your daughter and Don Andres are waiting for you in the dining room. As always. The friends of Paca Gallego are getting something special. Why do you say so, ma'am? Maybe you ignore it, because you don't know why. But you can say that John Hiro and that guy who is often dedicated to dancing naked in front of the audience, you don't say anything, Agres. I have to tell something, Mr. Vicky. Everyone here is free to earn their own living, and I don't have to put a veil on him. Ah, so you think that's very correct? You don't see anything immoral about it. Mr. Vicky, if we're going to talk about morality, we'll have to talk about you. Here we'll censor it. I paid for going to see them. It was Adelina's farewell and I don't think I've done anything wrong. They'll think about what they do. I didn't know you were so free, Andrés. If I were in their same position, I'd probably choose the same job, no matter what the criticism is. Let's talk about them. Let's talk about the gay pack. What do you think of a woman who has that kind of friendship? Is that all? Friendship is worth the price, Dona Vicky. Not for what they do, they don't stop doing it. And do you think they often do it because they appreciate it, sincerely? Or because she's paying them for her company? Marcella, my advice is when you're ready to go out for a walk."

Yo creo que cuando uno convive dentro de un vestuario, evidentemente tiene más relación de afinidad como en cualquier trabajo que ustedes puedan participar. Evidentemente uno va a cenar con algunos compañeros que después se terminan siendo amigos y con otros compiten y tienen los mismos objetivos en común. Con José Luis nos unió un mismo objetivo como también me uní con otros compañeros que no salía a cenar, pero evidentemente no suene algo que es clave en esto, que es ganar. Y en consideración de esto de Montcharlado, con Miguel, con Cerezo y obviamente tenemos un objetivo en común todos que es ganar. No gusta un equipo agresivo, no gusta un equipo que sea... Lo que me encantaría poder ver la historia del atético Madrid siempre tuvo un equipo fuerte, de la guerra, un equipo que sea contrabolpiador, un equipo que sea veloz, lo que no identificó a todos los atléticos para enamorarnos de esta gloriosa camiseta, que tener claro a qué jugamos. Y si vamos a la historia nuestra, la historia de nuestra es eso, y vamos a ir en búsqueda de eso. La responsabilidad es enorme, sé la exigencia que tiene el atlético de Madrid, no me asusta absolutamente, todo lo contrario, me entusiasma, todas las situaciones que siempre generan desafíos en mi vida han sido lindas y esta es una más. Y bueno, acá estamos en conjunto con los dirigentes, la gente y sobre todo lo más importante que son los jugadores recuperar un poco de todo lo que siempre... No, yo creo que lo ha tenido, hasta hace muy poco, cuando en campañas anteriores ha logrado la Europa League, ha llegado a las finales. Este último paso de estos 6 meses no han sido de lo mejor, pero sin duda que hay un plantel que se ha construido pensando en los mejores objetivos y bueno, en eso buscaremos con los jugadores sobre todo encontrar los mejores caminos para terminar una temporada en el mejor lugar. Creo que el Atlético Madrid tiene jugadores muy importantes como Reyes, como Adrián, como Marta, como Falcao, como Diego y obviamente todos los jugadores que están hoy en el club se merecen la mayor atención y obviamente escucharemos. Evidentemente me interese y me gusta contar con los jugadores que quieran estar en el lugar donde trabajan y obviamente que sientan el lugar donde están. Así que conversaremos y estamos abiertos obviamente a tener a los mejores y reyes de un jugador muy importante. A mí el ilusionarse el pensar, el imaginarse, son todas fantasías y posibilidades. Yo vivo de la realidad y la realidad se ha partido del Málaga.","With José Luis, we have never had any problems. I think that when one lives in a dressing room, obviously it has more affinity as in any work that you can participate. Obviously one is going to have dinner with some friends, who then end up being friends, and with others competes and has the same goals in common. With José Luis, we have the same goal, I also joined with other teammates who didn't go out to dinner, but obviously it doesn't sound like something that is key in this, winning.

What I would love to see is what the history of Atlético Madrid always had. A strong team, a team that is counter-attacks, a team that is fast, what did not identify all the athletes to fall in love with this glorious shirt, what to have clear what we play and if we go to our history, our history is that and we are going to go in search of that. The responsibility is huge, I know the demand that the Atletico de Madrid has, it does not scare me absolutely, on the contrary, I am enthusiastic All the situations that always generate challenges in my life have been beautiful. And this is one more. And well, here we are together with the managers, the people, and above all, the most important thing that are the players, to recover a little of everything that always ... No, I think I've had it, until very recently, when in previous campaigns, the Europa League has achieved. This last step of the six months has not been the best, but there is a plan that has been built thinking about the best objectives and we will look for the best paths to finish a season in the best place. I think that the Atlético Madrid has very important players like Reyes, We have a lot of players in the club, who are interested in the club and who want to be in the place where they work. We are open to having the best players and they are a very important player. thinking, imagining, all fantasies and possibilities. I live the reality, and reality is part of the malaga."

The conservationist of the Bangok Museum in Amsterdam, Leo Chan, believes that the theory is interesting, but that to confirm it, it takes evidence, which is difficult to get, given the time spent, According to the biography of the painter, on July 27, 1890, Van Gogh left the Alderge Agabou and five hours later he died in the arms of his brother Teo.

A incentivo a projetos culturais não é de financiamento de projetos culturais. Então cabe a comissão avaliar o projeto e ver quanto é que pode dar para como incentivo cultural para a realização daquele projeto. O nosso amigo Arejúnio da banda Epidemia Tipo-5, o projeto dele ficou de 4 mil reais, como ele diz, foi aprovado mil reais, eu acredito que tê-te sido, não sei quanto, ao certo, mas foi aprovado pela comissão, inclusive conseguimos até uma pessoa para produzir o CD dele com esse valor, infelizmente, se deixando levar por terceiros, por pessoas que têm por trás, que isso não partiu só da cabeça dele, infelizmente, ele vem com isso atonte, denunciando, achando que há irregularidade, infelizmente, para contrário a alo, não há irregularidade, o valor aprovado pela comissão, certo? De certa forma, é justa, não só o projeto dele, mas outros projetos também que passaram e também estão recebendo financiamento. E também quero lembrar que desde que foi criado o Fumink, nunca foi se aprovado um projeto na íntegra dos projetos dele. da história do FOMINC de 2003 pra cá, nenhum dos projetos foi aprovado na Integra. Então, o nosso amigo, o que está se deixando levar por pessoas que não estão de acordo com o resultado do FOMINC, pessoas que não foram contempladas, pessoas que de certa forma tiveram seus projetos receitados pela comissão. E quero também lembrar que a comissão, cara amigo Ari, não é só Hernandes, a comissão foi formada por três membros. Um membro da cidade de Souza que é o Leonardo Alves produtor cultural do Centro Cultural Banco do Nordeste e o nosso amigo de São João do Rio do Peixe que no momento não estou lembrando o nome dele que foi formado essa comissão de três pessoas com participação de Hernandes e então tirado sua dúvida que a nossa intenção foi de fazer a coisa mais transparente que possível trazendo pessoas da cidade para essa comissão para que avaliassem os projetos e foi assim o resultado. Infelizmente não pode ser, não pode se agradar a todos se o nosso amigo Arifico insatisfeito é direito dele a sua insatisfação e se ele não deseja receber o financiamento, o incentivo cultural eu até pediria aqui para que ele formulasse isso por escrito documentasse nos de boca e de boca, só beijo né, então infelizmente está acontecendo isso por alguma parte, seguimentos de alguns da cultura que fazem oposição ao governo d'Aeneze e também a administração aqui da secretaria, mas é isso, o que eu tenho que dizer é isso, ele devia ver, estudar um pouquinho a lei, lei oedital, certo, e ver que não é de financiamento cultural, é de incentivo. O restante, o proponente do projeto, ele tem que correr atrás, mas fazer o quê? Infelizmente está acontecendo isso e eu só lamento essas picuinhas pequenas e bobas para querer atrapalhar o processo.","First, we have to explain that the Fund for the Municipal of the Culture, the FUMINC, is a fund for the culture's incentive. The incentive for cultural projects is not for financing of cultural projects. So, the commission is to evaluate the project and see how much it can give as a cultural incentive for the implementation of that project. Our friend, Ari Junho, from the Epidemia Tipo-5 band, his project was and denouncing that there is irregularity, unfortunately, to counter it, there is no irregularity, the approved value by the Commission, right? In a way, it is fair, not only his project, but other projects that also passed, are also receiving financing, and I also want to remember that since Fumimc was created, a project was never approved on the whole, The Fominck history of 2003, no project was approved in the integral. So our friend, who is letting himself be taken by people who are not in agreement with the result of the Fominck, people who were not contemplated, people who, in a way, had their projects rejected by the commission. And I also want to remind you that the commission, dear friend Ari, is not just Hernandez. The commission was formed by three members. One member of the city and our friend, who is Leonardo Alves, a cultural producer of the Central Cultural Bank of the Northeast and our friend, São João do Rio do Peixe, who at the moment I am not remembering his name, who was formed by this commission of three people with the participation of Hernandes. So, I took your doubt, which our intention was to do the most transparent thing possible, bringing people from different countries to the north, to this commission to evaluate the projects. And that was the result. Unfortunately, it cannot be appreciated by everyone. If our friend Arif is dissatisfied, it is his right to be dissatisfied. And if he does not want to receive the financing, the cultural incentive, I would even ask him to formulate this by writing, to document it and to deliver it to us. and I want him to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able to do it, to be able and I wish you all the best. Unfortunately, this is happening in some parts of the culture that oppose the government of the government of the secretariat. But that's it. What I mean is that he should study a bit of the law, the Edital law, and see that it's not about cultural financing. The rest of the project's proponent has to run back, but what to do? Unfortunately, this is happening and I'm only complaining about these little little ones and little ones to want to catch up with the process."

It was wonderful. We had a jeet and I was driving north of Paris. When we got to this beautiful family yard, obviously paid for by the European folks, we threw up in front of what Ruth and I thought was an absolutely gorgeous the I was a small but adequate kitchen and Ruth and I looked at each other thinking we'd come to French heaven. This was everything you dream of of a French country holiday pool. And Carol looked round and said, well, I suppose some people have to live like this. To her it was horrible but to us an absolute dream. She didn't quite get French lifestyle. But that's what happens when you you periods. And the Bible says you should take three holidays a year. We're looking this month at the rhythms of life and the importance of fitting in with those rhythms. God designed you and put you together in such a way that you need to have rhythm in your life. There's rhythm in the whole of creation. There's the rhythm of spring, summer, autumn, winter. There's the rhythm of day and night, the rhythm of birth, growth, death, decay, all these rhythms indicate that God is a God who enjoys placing rhythm in life and that you and I need rhythm and if your life will be drugged down, if you try and break those and work through the time so God says you're going to struggle. We looked last week at the fact that God tells us to work for six days and have one day of complete rest. We looked at why that was, we spent time in that family, we needed it, we were able to do that, we've to be like God. This week we're looking at holidays and you have memories from your holidays. You have things to talk about, you have pictures you bring back, there's nothing more wonderful than that. the net. Going on holiday and coming back and showing the pictures. Nothing quite so bad as having to watch somebody else's pictures but that's just how life is. But why does God say, and here's where he says it, in Utenanime chapter 16 verse 16 what's happening is Moses is telling the people the last things they need to know before they go into the promised land. They're going to go into a life a life of luxury, a life of comfort and ease. They've been slaves in Egypt and they didn't like it. They've been wandering in the wilderness for 40 years and they weren't keen on that. But God hasn't promised them that he's going to bring them to a new land where they will be prosperous, where they will be comfortable, where they will have enough and more than enough. And he says, and this is how you're told they will you there because it's very tempting to try and live in your own way. If you've got plenty, get some more. If you've got plenty, keep it. If you've got plenty, take advantage of the opportunity. God will give through Moses the final commandment. It's in the Book of Deuteronomy. Moses, once he's told them the Book of Deuteronomy, goes up the mountain and he dies. The people of Israel mourn him and then they cross the river Jordan and come into the the house can dream of. And he says when you get there, do you remember me? Chapter 16 verse 16. Three times a year all of you must appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose, at the feast of 11 red, that's Passover, the feast of weeks that's Pentecost seven weeks later and the feast of Tabernacles that's in the autumn. So you've got spring, one sort of mid-summer, an early summer and one at the end of the summer in the autumn. Three holidays and you have to go to God, in other words, you have to go up to Jerusalem. So wherever you're living in the land, you go up to Jerusalem and when you get there, you take a week there. You spend a week and what would they do? Well, they'd go together as families, they'd meet up with the rest of the family from around the country. They'd all meet together in one place and they would feast, they would have plenty to eat, they would relax, they would see the sights, they would camp, yes those of you, have it down on camping on the fridges, they would camp on the hillside on the mountain of olives and then they would eat, they would drink and they would have a bread time and a week later they'd go home, it was a good one, and they'd go home rejoicing. Why does he tell them to do this? Why does he say you must This is a command from God. When you go on your holiday you obey God's commands. That feels better doesn't it? It's a good thing to go on holiday. God says I want you to do this three times every year. Take a break and go on holiday. Why? Because you need the rest and you know you do. When you've been working for a while you say I'm so glad. However much you love your job it's tiring and you'll be glad. You need the rest. But I usually find that it takes me till about Wednesday or Thursday to forget about work. Up till then I'm thinking of things to work, things that I like to do, things I just do, I want to get back, plans that need to be made. I'm thinking about till about Wednesday or Thursday. About the end of the week I don't want to go back to work. I work it here, but you have to go back to work. You can have the whole of the diet, that's not the way. But when you've got a job and you've got prosperity, you need to take a rest three times a week. The second reason that God wants them to do this is that it gives them quality time with their family. People talk about quality time there. When's the best time? The best time is your holiday time. That's why so many people go back to the place they went in their childhood. This week I saw an item on the television from Watergate Bay. Oh, we had wonderful holidays when I was 11 and 12. of Watergate Bay and it was just marvellous and when our children were little I took them to Watergate Bay. I don't think it was quite as exciting for them because we made them walk a long way from where we were stopping and they're walking a long way."

Alright first we'll start off with the box. It is for ages 7 to 14 and lag on over 7067 and there you can see the alien conquest logo and in this corner it has got a alien pirate You get two of them, so onto the minifigures. You get two alien pilots and one alien pilot onto the play features. Here you get a little jail pod thing and then I'm going to be showing you all the play features. Now for the minifigures. First we'll start off with the alien pilot. This is the alien pilot and I'm sorry about that but there are the legs with a lot of technology not double sided I'll just take off for the head to more detail. There we go, so that's the alien. This is the ADU pilot. You can see the detail on his armour and he is double sided, nothing on the feet. on the back but it's quite cool. He has got a double sided head and his helmet is from the space police 3 I think. If I'm not right please can you comment and correct me. So that's him. And they're sort of a yay we got him, we got him, we got g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g The ADI gun is quite cool, it's got a light on the end for the laser. I think it's a new piece. So there's the gun. And this is the ADI gun. That's how they hold it, but it's really neat piece. It's really rare and really cool. Sorry about that, I was just checking if it was playing. yep that's really cool but if you put some binoculars on the end, binoculars you should get this and these are supposed to go onto the actual helicopter. I onto the alien ship hovercraft things that's the front view and these parts can move up and down and you get two of these for each one and I'm going to show you something really really cool. If you bend both of them up they can connect together so like that. On to the actual set. I'll show you the prison cell. It can open and close and it can go into the back of the helicopter like that. Oh sorry, like that. And you can take it off and I will put an alien in it. Take this gun off and then you can put your alien scumbag right in the back. Right now onto the set. It is a really really big, well it's not big it's just really cool. It's got sort of two machine guns here on each side. It's got rockets and then I have one for propeller and it's got some chronic cool stickers on there. it took me about five or six times to get on because it's really confusing and it's got stickers on the side and these these engine parts they can move up and down puts the engine like diagonal like that when it's flying like that if it's landing straight if it's landing and just push them up to the top if it's just on the ground like this.

I am such a new bit of stuff. I just love watching videos and seeing what these guys do in terms of boosting with those Max On and stuff like that. I got a couple of MXR pedals. I got the modified OD, the custom bad ass and I just got the MXR classic overdrive. Stupid me thought that I could just put one of those on the clean channel and have like a totally brand new distortion channel but obviously over Overdrive pedals. Thank you Nate from judgment on the ESP boards Took me to realize that For a clean channel. It's really not gonna do that much you're gonna hear those string Overtones those clean string overtones when using it on your clean channel But anyway, I love extreme mode on channel three and these are my settings for my kind of main rhythm dirty But the problem is with these graphic EQ sliders I can never freaking dial in Channel two and mark one mode so I guess what I'm trying to do is basically use and I think Mark 1 mode likes to be opened up. primary distortion. I sure as well relied on the tube heads. And maybe I'll make some videos down the road because I know everyone loves to boost rectos with these to kind of compress and tighten up the sound. So I'll do another video of that. But here's just some clips of me playing mostly Mark 1 mode and just a little bit of channel 3 so you hear what I like from my rhythm tone. Thanks.

They can't even stop your lips on the road Your lips are also gathering from your eyes The word that is covered with a veil is coming to you I built my body with my hands, but that was the smile that was on your lips I'm lying on my feet today like a dead chicken In your knees, the veil is not protected at all I look at you, because I hold your eyebrows, covered in clouds like a march on your forehead The wind blowing trees like your hands When you take off your veil I know, I was a villain who had no right to ruin I promised you that before death Your bright eyes are walking in a silent fog They lower the air of the clouds and gather on the rain You leave the clock with a cloud, you look at the street The sun of the west, our shadows create one But slowly, in the dead of night, their shadows fall Our last rain will start in a moment, falling star. They said many times, you don't know romantic stories, but we really felt that we have a chance. Life is hard now, for every day. It pays, it pays, it pays, it pays, it pays, it pays. Because it will never be like before, black palazzo, our world is covered in dust. Like a wolf on a tree, dancing in our arch, on a dragon's tail, which is piling up on the earth. Pray for us, before we drown it. Even if nothing has changed, Dna! Nothing but us. Until our knees are covered with the shadow, they will be gently covered in the surface of the defeated fashions. The upper sky, the lower earth, will not stop pouring rain on us from these black hole knees, in which the empty form of matter is dying, the lost pleasure. You know what it is, you know for sure.

You don't want to drink at this phone, go ahead and drink. After that, I pour a hand and I pour her with me. That would seem like she was pouring me a drink of water already. She likes to do art and crafts. She likes to cut papers and paste and do a kind of montage style. She likes to play games. Even her mother says she likes to run around and she runs very fast. From her, it's very different from the other trainees. The kind of response I get from her at a start, Although she may be classified into but actually she is very kind hearted. She likes to come to the people. She is really a very good and nice girl. She always helps her friends like Duen and Gaia. Like during the visit where we went to the highest station around Singapore, through of the whole trip, she pulled Joanne's hand and my hand and Joanne's chain, she pulled Joanne's hand. Yeah, that's very sweet of her. So, she is really very true to you, the kind of people. You can feel that she is very sincere. It's not what you get from even like us normal people. You may not even get the truth. answer from your friends around you. So she's really a proof and a sweet girl to me. Because her smile is always better my day. Actually there's no one word that I can describe but for now I think it's very playful but very kind of happen. Hi everybody, I'm Magnus. I've been working with Process Interlectual Disability for close to 7 years and through the 7 years I've learnt a lot from them. People always ask why do you want to volunteer every Saturday? What is it that it's like giving? What do you want to give up so much time for them? In fact, I would always think that volunteering is not a one way street, it's more like a two way street where we spend our time with the beneficiaries and at the same time we learn from them as well. We often think of volunteering as giving but actually I think it's more than that. We actually receive a lot from volunteering too. In the past few years of volunteering, I've learnt a lot more about patience, about humility. Two years I've learnt to be more patient, to be more understanding, to be able to see things from different perspectives and to see the genuine side of humans. I've learnt not to judge people as much and also I think most importantly not to underestimate the made-up problems because I think optimism is very important in order to do something you have to do. Our trainees are just like any other people. When disabled doesn't mean that they just have to sit down and watch the world go by. All they need is really the opportunity and the ability and the patience for people to love them, to give them the opportunity to grow. So that at least for one, we know that they will be able to live independently should their families decide to leave them behind. Our trainees actually do surprise us a lot of the times with the things that we are involved in. I would really appreciate if more people were to understand the intellect they disabled instead of giving them a weird look. They are more like us. and they can actually absorb what we teach them. They are not really what we think. And all this years, it has been very insightful that they are teaching us how to love people, to treat people genuinely and all I'm asking of everyone of you, or rather to encourage all of you to have an open mind, to give them the opportunity to show the world what they can do. space to learn to grow and to believe and then support them along the way. In fact, a lot of people think that persons with intellectual disability are not doing anything. They are just waiting for the world to go by. But that's not true. I see people shooing them away at past-to-restaurant. I really don't think that's the way we should treat them. Maybe they are just looking at the venue like we are. I came to realise that a lot of people with intellectual disability are making themselves useful in many different ways. We should actually try to look beyond the disability to look at the person we're doing. And we will actually realise that our clients have their own personalities, different characters, different squads, interesting persons, likes, and straights and pieces just like our customers. care that you will give anyone, individual that you come across in your life. So, yeah, I hope more people will understand them and join us to volunteer."

It would sometimes make me tremble, believing that you are an evidence of nothing. As much as the first days, love was all new, shining like a metal that was polished. He really drew like a sunoff. The season passes, bringing their water of joy and happiness, but also suffering. We remain united, carried in the flow, to not transgress the will of our alliance. The sirens are one, marking our faces, while our skin is mollified, and when we see the images of our 20 years old, it seems to me to see you sad and sad. That's why my mind asks a question that if my heart for you burns with the same fire, it would be me to know in what proportion it does not hold it. Tell me. But do you give it a little?"

Als je naar het winken dan heen we natuurlijk al zoals ze buikje hebben elkaar klopt. Het lastige is dat je als hondenbaasje niet altijd even goed zicht hebt op je hond. Zeker niet als hij losloopt. En voor je het weet heeft je vier voeten een spons achter de kiezen. Ja, gekken zijn het. Hier laat we de honden gewoon uit, maar de mensen gaan natuurlijk ook daar achter lopen. En misschien... Ik vind alle mensen dat niet leuk. Vandaar die voren. Dat denk ik. Ik denk niet dat het onder hondenhaard zelf gaat. Ik denk dat het meer onder hondenpoep gaat. Als je last hebt van de hondenpoep, spreek de baasjes aan. En er werkt niet een hond dat die poep, want zo'n hond kan daar niets aan doen. Nu moet dat gewoon. Die heeft geen wc. Toch is niet iedereen ervan overtuigd dat de kwaner opzet in het spel is. Ik denk dat het van de glazenwassen geweest zijn. Gewoon de spoonzaam laten vallen daar.

I heard that a neighbour had grown sponsor here with a knife against the dogs. I came in the evening last night and someone came in and said... ...he found his sponsor and carefully looked after the dog. There are sponsors that are already 8 or 9 of course. Well, I'm very happy with you. What kind of sponsors are they? They are sponsors of the yellow ones. Such things. Yes, such things. They then give me that prop. They're on their backs, so that there's a reliable guard. And then the dogs are taken. If they drink, they'll run away like they did with the dog. The hard part is that you don't always have a good view of the dog, especially when he walks away. Before you know it, you have a spot behind the choose. Yes, it's crazy. Here we let the dogs out, but the people are going to walk behind there. And maybe... I think all people like that. I don't think it's only about the dog. I think it's more about the dog. If you're afraid of the dog, the bosses talk. And there's no use for a dog to poop. A dog can't do anything about it. It's just... It's got no toilet paper. But not everyone is convinced that the quail is in the game. I think it was the glass washers. The ones we'd let go of. Normally the glass washers were used to clean the stalks. Water hose, otherwise. No sponsors? No, normally not. If someone puts something like that down, you do it? Yeah, can I tell the camera? I don't think so. Who's doing something like that?

On applique grossièrement un jumbo blanc ou un crayon blanc gras sur la paupière mobile, puis on laisse tomber pour intensifier par la suite le phare blanc. Après avoir appliqué le phare blanc sur la paupière mobile, on va commencer par contourner le creux de la paupière en essayant de le tracer les yeux ouverts. On peut ensuite remonter la matière vers le haut en effectuant des petits coulis vifs vers l'extérieur. On essaie ensuite de mettre le feu à l'extérieur. de tracer une petite virgule qui rejoint la ligne du creux. Je le travaille en fait un peu comme un trade eyeliner. Une fois que c'est fait, on metstompe les bords, puis on commence à tracer une ligne continue qui s'incline vers le bas. Et je fais le contour de l'oeil que j'aurais pu faire avant d'ailleurs. Ici, geste-t-on un peu le phare noir qui se trouve dans le coin externe avec mon pinceau. On n'oublie pas la touche lumière en dessous du sourcil en utilisant un phare blanc irrisé. Particularité, on applique entre les deux lignes un phare blanc. Les paillettes sont facultatives, mais vous pouvez quand même en appliquer pour subliminer les cils-faites de la scène ou même d'ailleurs en soirée. On en met donc par-dessus le phare blanc de la paupière mobile et entre les deux loups. Je protège aussi mon teint qu'il soit fait ou non d'éventuelle chute à l'aide de morceaux de papier. Je mets ensuite du crayon noir dans ma muqueuse pour mettre le regard en valeur. C'est important de faire ces sourcils pour faire ressortir le maquillage. Bien sûr, on applique du mascara sur les cils de la paupière supérieure et avant. Pour ce qui est des lèvres, je commence par tracer le contour avec un crayon rose en commençant par le cœur des lèvres pour arriver au commissure que ce soit sur la lèvre supérieure ou sur la lèvre inférieure. Et j'applique un lipglas de couleur rose en retirant les fels lustres qui en fait un peu trop avant de goût avec du papier. Pour éviter d'en faire trop, je conseille d'utiliser un blush dans les tons neutres plutôt que rose pour être des softs. On sourit évidemment pour cibler les pommettes. Voilà le look est terminé. J'espère que ça vous aura plu, c'est toujours, je sais, un peu dans le style oriental comme après ces vente vidéos. Du coup bientôt je ferai des choses un peu plus simples.

Allez, à bientôt.","As usual, apply a base on the whole of the paper to start. We roughly apply a white jumbo or a grey crayon on the mobile paper, then we let it fall to intensify by following the white light. After applying the white light on the mobile paper, we will start by contouring the edge of the paper by trying to trace it with open eyes. We can then go back to the top by making small cuts live outwards. We then try to I'm going to draw a little line that joins the line of the crane. I'm actually working it a little like a tread eyeliner. Once it's done, we put the edges on, then we start to draw a continuous line that goes down. And I do the outline of the eye that I could have done before, by the way. Here, I'm a little managing the black iron that is in the external corner with my brush. Don't forget the light touch, under the eyebrows using a white and iris light. In particular, we apply between the two lines a white iron. The glitter is not a cult, but you can still apply it to cover the face of the scene or even in the evening. We put it on the white part of the mobile eyelid and between the two eyes. I also protect my chin, whether it is done or not, or maybe it falls on the paper. I then put black crayon in my mucous to put the look in value. It is important to do these eyebrows to make the makeup come out. Of course, we apply mascara on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid. For the lips, I start by drawing the outline with a pink crayon, starting with the heart of the lips to arrive at the comma, whether on the upper or lower lip. I apply a lip gloss of pink color by removing the lustre effect which makes it a little too much for you with paper. To avoid doing it too much, I advise you to use a blush in the neutral tones rather than pink to be soft. We smile obviously to target the little pommettes.

And I flipped it out of it. I never heard of this brand, Eastwood. And he had a few other guitars. And I guess they're a company that based outside of Toronto. And they're kind of specialized in making new versions of all the old classic cheap guitars, the airline guitars, the Mosrites, a few other crazy things. And making them new and better because like a lot of those old cheap guitars are cool looking and have this particular sound but the bridges fall off and you know the pick up buzz and all that kind of stuff so they're making really quality versions of the cool old guitars. I think at EastwoodGuitars.com you should check it out. People like me like guitars who like guitars and also like cool 60s things go on there and drool. Anyway Scott was kind enough to get me the REM special artist discount deal And I was like a kid in a candy store. I'm not gonna say how much discount was but I had to buy two you know I just love them so I got the one like he had and that's called the side Jack Green side Jack great guitar kind of clean But then I got this other one called a twin tone. It's Sherry red twin tone and this thing is Just got a couple humbuckers there and just it's like a rock of taking off. It's a noisy ugly Squawky kind of thing. I love it. I play that one a lot it shows a special occasion kind of thing enough for everything You're not going to play clean, tasty licks, but I tend not to do that so much anyway. So they're great. And just recently I went up to Toronto for a vacation to stop by their offices. Nice people in the world. I can't say enough about them. Really super cool. And I will point out, and I may be talking out of school here, but they're very very friendly about artist discounts. So if you are out there and you have a band that's making records and touring it all, write to them in Ozark. They'll probably hook you up in some way.

Now it's going to give you the default default width and height size, the first thing as an eye frame. But if you would like you can pick a standard size, they'll give you the various sizes available just as default sizes. Now in some cases you may want to use a custom size, in this case we do. So what I'm gonna do is select from the drop down custom size. you have to keep this in mind that you have to do it this way. You can't just put in any arbitrary number between width and height. It has to be proportional. And what will happen is when you put in the width, in our case, we want to set the width to 325 pixels. It will put in what the height should be, proportionally, for the video. And if these aren't entered correctly, erratic behavior can happen. It might not show up. It might look like a little bit of a problem. I think most of the time it just doesn't show up. So just be sure to put it in here and then just accept whatever it has over here.

And with the original IOHT, when I first went in the very first developmental meetings in early 2007 before it came out, first thing I said to them, why don't we have 12? My specialty in my work is mostly done on film production sets, commercials, those kinds of things. So I have the ability to see information differently. But with the Keef Pro, we now have something that allows inexpensive older cameras, HDB cameras. The problem with cameras nowadays is there's a flavor of the month. There are so many versions of how you do things and where you do things. It's difficult for a lot of people to understand that Canon HDB is different than Sony HDB and they don't quite marry together anymore. And by actually accessing the manufacturing Now, what AJ and Apple have done have combined to be able to capture 10,000 and make them join the take-less modern revolution. Everything is always live on the outputs. And with a tool like this, you can not have the ability to not only work at a higher method, but save so much time and post. Say you have a standard definition camera, a 720 camera that does variable frame rate and a 1080 camera. You need to be able to handle these in multiple different ways. So you can take standard definition, 625 information and upconvert it to 50i, so it's probably being handled. take that 720 camera and do an overcrank or undercrank because the AJ technology has always supported variable frame rate capture. You can actually go in and capture the information of the 720 camera and convert it to 1080. So now I have 1080 60 from 525, I have 1080 50 from 720 and I have 1080 50 from a camera that might do something else. And you have to be able to do all of these things and have a unified platform for post. Because one of the things that people see is they want to do all different kinds of flavors of timeline. then they find out that I have to render for a program. I've got to set there in a way, if you're working in HDV, you've got to conform, you have all of these issues with production and post. Now, by starting at the camera head and determining what's being done at post, we are taking the highest level practices in the film industry, the film industry, how they shoot it on set, it stays that way all the way through post. Now, we're taking the same filmic style, film style philosophy, as you can say. We want you to capture it at the camera so that it maintains its integrity all the way through the post. actually do that better. And we're going to partner with a number of companies. And it's actually, we've even done things like, made a removable base plate on the back so you can actually control and change information. So with this as a removable piece, you actually have the ability to change and modify that to add other accessories. Say, you could do with this one, an example, I was talking to somebody from a company called Zacuto, which makes a lot of accessories. And they were immediately thinking about doing a direct attach here for battery plate. So it goes right to the 12 volt. And then instead of being on the it hangs behind and with a smaller camera it might give better balance on their system. So it's things like that that people have written. It's all about making sure that people share information and do that. But some people have a better idea about how hardware works and about how configuration for the hardware works. So why not let people who do what they do do it? Why don't we let people who do better than do the best? My mouth is tired.","HAA was instrumental in doing, you know, starting the whole, let's try and understand what we need to do and progress is so good, but Apple doesn't do anything with it.

And by actually accessing the manufacturing Now, what AJ and Apple have done have combined to be able to capture 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and make them join the take this modern revolution. Everything is always live on the outputs. And with a tool like this, you can not have the ability to not only work at a higher method, but save so much time and post. Say you have a standard definition camera, a 720 camera that has a variable frame rate and a 1080 camera. You need to be able to handle these in multiple different ways. So you can take standard definition, 625 information and upconvert it to 50i, so it's probably being handled. the then they find out that I have to render for a couple of hours. I've got to set there in a way, if you're working in HDV, you've got to conform, you have all of these issues with production and post. Now, by starting at the camera head and determining what's being done at post, we are taking the highest level practices in the film industry, the film industry, how they shoot it on set, it stays that way all the way through post. Now, we're taking the same film style, film style philosophy, as you can say. We want you to capture it at the camera so that it maintains its integrity all the way through the post. and we're going to partner with a number of companies. And it's actually, we've even done things like maybe a removable base plate on the back so you can actually control and change information. So with this as a removable piece, you actually have the ability to change and modify that to add other accessories. Say, you could do with this one, a good example, I was talking to somebody from a company called Zacuto, which makes a lot of accessories. And they were immediately thinking about doing a direct attach here for battery plate. So it goes right to the 12 volt. And then instead of being on the radio, it hangs behind and with a smaller camera it might give better balance on their system. So it's things like that that people have written. It's all about making sure that people share information and do that. But some people have maybe a better idea about how hardware works and about how configuration for the hardware works. So why not let people who do what they do do it? Why don't we let people who do better than do the best? My mouth is tired."

The company specialized in doing business is the company of selling. I would like to introduce to you the CEO of the company, Chen Hongxian. Today, I am sitting next to Su Ming, the leader of the Chinese National Security Council. So I am a very good friend of the Qingfeng people. I know, but we are very happy to be in this competition, we are very curious. Why do you think it's a big motivation? How about talking about marriage first? If it's a marriage, you have to be responsible for it. Then you have to be smart and have to be smart. If you want to be a man, you have to be responsible for it. You are saying that the law is very simple. I don't know if I can explain it like this. But if it's really like this, everyone will understand it. No, it's actually my own opinion. Is it true that marriage is a marriage? The final answer is yes. I don't think it's right. Then I didn't come to the concert. What is your first impression of him? He looks like a sunny guy. I can ask the three of you to tell us your first impression. Chen Chen. He has artistic qualities. I want to ask you something. Sorry. The color of your hair. Do you know? Or you are really good at it. Many people think I am a bit lazy. Do you think? I feel like I am a special person. Yes. Actually, I am naturally. Wow! I was a senior in high school.

At that time, there was no air conditioner. The computer was installed in the room. My parents were all scientists. So I felt that the room with air conditioner was the best technology. So I reported to the computer specialist. At that time, I didn't know what the computer was doing. Later, when I went to America, I felt that the industry was learning. At that time, there was a computer network in the field. I think it's a good idea to look for the personality. Of course, my personality is a traditional style of this RQ spirit. The personality of RQ, you can't always think of its definition, right? You have to learn its proof. RQ spirit is often full of satisfaction. In fact, sometimes it's a little success. Other people think it's nothing. I think it's important to be happy. So I'm particularly happy. Right? You just said that I'm giving you a hug, but you just thought that everyone's holding a high note. I'm always satisfied with my own way of playing. As long as you feel satisfied with your own things, you feel happy with others. When you reach a certain point, you feel happy."

Sí, este es un caso muy atípico, no es un luto que una muerte que sea que se han probado, corroborado rápidamente, esto ha sido todo un calvario, ¿no? Siendo alguna el desgaste mental, el desgaste físico, no es, es mucho mayor. Entonces, una de las posibilidades que estamos viendo es adelantarle las vacaciones, ¿no? Que pueda tomar un mes después del que se cumplan los días de rigor del luto, adelantarle un mes de vacaciones, si él lo desea, para que él pueda tener la tranquilidad del caso de descansar, recuperarse y después concordar con nosotros la fecha de reincorporación, ¿no?","Dr. Yaribal Lima, to install that one in the fallout as a highlight, proceeded from the hospital in the UNH's butron of Puno, he had a permanent here for two years, returned to Puno in 2005, returned to the fallout, he was already installed in the fallout in Punta, it seems to me, and well, I had the opportunity to even talk to him 15 or 20 days before this misfortune happened, just by asking me to be included in the group of vaccinations, because here in the fallout we are and health workers who come from other places and are at a level in the benefit of the people of health workers and it is precisely that this mercy coincides with this misfortune and we have the director of the regional president the other moreno to be able to give all the facilities as it is obvious it is not a very sensitive issue he will be assigned to a square of the regional health direction and there will be highlighted in the desirous and three options the hospital of ventana Hospital level 2 1 in the hospital San José or the opposite of the hospital car where he was where he came working until the day of the that the facts were in the hospital car as in what service he was paying for him he is he is a surgeon he is a abdomen surgeon he is in the room b of the hospital car to see a recognized surgeon had a traditory intangible transparent I could as I told him to talk to him about 20 minutes about his work that he did here because I just got to the management also so that we are going to leave all the facilities all the facilities so that he can get to install himself again here in Lima to meet with the natural issue that is the struggle we are going to give him the facilities also of the rest that is that it is normal with respect to what the struggle is for a family death and we are going to see if it is going to be able to reintegrate within the next month not suddenly advancing the vacations and seeing that he can have all the tranquility to the case to find the balance that is very difficult in these cases so that later it can be incorporated into his medical work here in the hospital. You as colleagues have seen the issue of suddenly supporting him psychologically after all this hard process by which he has gone. Look, our regional president is a doctor. Precisely. We just talked yesterday about the issue. To raise all the facilities, everything that we as colleagues first and as work partners and as health authorities can establish in favor of psychological recovery, emotional recovery, Dr. Ciro Castillo, we are at the order and at the request of the family. Dr. González, once the doctor arrives, he will be there for this hard process. He will have time to ask you to rest. If he wishes, he will be incorporated. Yes, this is a very atypical case. It is not a fight or a death that is corroborated quickly this has been a whole Calvary without a doubt some of the mental waste of physical waste is not much greater then there is one of the possibilities that we are seeing is to advance the vacations that can take a month after the day of rigor of the loot to advance a month of vacation if he wishes so that he can have the tranquility of the case of resting recover and then agree with us the date of reincorporation"

I was at the base of the building with the priest, ministering to the injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend his flock in heaven. He heard my voice and answered. I was on all four of those planes in every seat. I was with the crews they were overtaken. I was in the very hearts of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their faith has saved them. I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when you heard the terrible news. Did you sense me? I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name, though not all knew me. Some met me for the first time on the 86th floor. Some sought me with their last breath. Some couldn't hear me calling to them. through the smoke and flames. Come to me this way. Take my hand. Some chose for the final time to ignore me. I did not place you in the tower that day. You may not know why, but I do. If you were there in that explosive moment in time, would you have reached for me? September 11, 2001 was not the end of the journey for you, but someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as well. Seek me now while I may be found. Then at any moment you know you are ready to go. We'll be in the stairwell of your final moments."

Il farsi in bilancio è molto importante in questo settore perché consentirebbe di accorre di indagare di accorgersi dell'esistenza di fondi neri o comunque di movimentazioni non spiegate e non legite, non trasparenti dal interno delle società.

Cifre is said to speak of the difficulty of erasing the legal status of the affairs, especially if it is about tax evasion or false imbalance. they are not born in a simple way but they can only be the result of a deep knowledge of economic reality. They have data that allow us to realize that there are investments that are not conducable to legitimate profits but that indicate an anomaly and therefore there are illegal capital. The balance of the work is very important in this sector because it would allow we can be aware of the existence of black funds or movements that are not explained and not read or transparent within the society. By doing this we can rise again to corruption phenomena, to the creation of black funds for the tangents, we can be aware of the fact that there are non-justified non-fueled funds and therefore rise again, through another type of fundage, not only financial, but also financial, to what is the origin, Italy is the only European country to not put the self-recycling. When the money, the profit of the lecito, is reinvested by the same owner of the re-election. Those who sell drugs and put the money back in the circle can be punished for the traffic of stupid people, but not for having recycled the illicit profits. A serious lack that is added to the great delay with which Italy has accepted the European forced cooperation tools. The European Commission has adopted a tool for the European institutions, and it provides the institution of common investigative teams. The possibility of police forces composing investigative teams that take care of transnational and transnational acts, which could be a big tool for intensifying collaboration This collaboration between the authorities and the various member states is much too weak. And it often affects very primitive things in the language. As long as people can speak too little foreign language, it is always difficult to work together. If you have to communicate with the translator on the phone, it becomes very complicated. My appeal is that we all need to learn European languages. We need them. Another front in the battle against recycling is the Bank Secretary. Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Belgium are the states where the attention of Brussels is concentrated. I think we have to make the state, which still has a lot of security, clear that they protect corruption, that they protect illegal illegal goods. and that they do not defend the Sparbuchter Großmutter. I think that needs a lot of public attention, but unfortunately there are too few in these countries because the banks in these countries are of course very good at earning money. I am very, very strict about this. The Convention of Strasbourg against corruption is not ratified in Italy. How is this considered in the fight against the I think we can all learn from the northern states in Europe where transparency is the rule and corruption is the small exception."

It's not worth it. Okay. I want you to doctor today. I my other video I had a streak right across there and I thought it was blood and I I called a doctor, my primary care physician who's local here and I went to see him and he looked at it and said, yes it's blood and I was thinking that maybe with this radiation thing I was bleeding internally or something. I don't know what I was doing but he said, no it's coming from this blister and I didn't know they could bleed. I've never had a fever blister that bled, that I know of. He said, yeah I can bleed so it bled and when I was sleeping it ran down here. That's what happened. I needed to see him to talk about my medication for this thyroid hormone replacement, which I have to take the rest of my life. The medication that I got from the hospital is this stuff, it's a thyroid medication, and I guess it's the pure hormone that the body does not have to do anything or maybe minimal things to absorb it. It's the top of the line. I think it's thyrox and the stuff that most people take as a daily, daily pill that they have to take, they take the pill and the body breaks it down and gives you the hormone. So that's, I think at Walmart it's something like $10 for three months. And the stuff that I got, the prescription is $60 a month. It's actually more than, you know, So I will be doing the cheaper version which is what everybody takes pretty much so I think the reason they did this is because I was coming out of surgery and This stuff just it just goes in and there it is rather than having to go in and get broken down So all kinds of stuff like that. So that's what that was and Also talked to him about getting set up for a complete physical complete physical exam I mean the works because I've never really done that I'm not very good you know I always had good health so hey when I want it was gonna continue well that's not the way it works sometimes but anyway I went to Albuquerque and you know I want you to make sure make sure make sure make sure because I don't want to forget and harm many of my viewers make sure that you've got your your tissue mask and just whoa it's a problem with the tissue It's very fragile, but it works against radiation. So you just put it up there like that and then you can see through there. See, I can see. And then you can watch the video like this because I don't want anybody to be harmed because of me. All right. Okay, put your mask on. I'll give you time. That is the radiation detector. It comes from Russia. So you know it's gotta be good if it comes from Russia. It's gotta be accurate. Russians don't dare make something that's not accurate or good. So I'm real confident in this quality of this piece of machinery here. And it's kind of funny, I told my friend that the doctors had said that I would pretty much be over this after three days. Today is the second day. And I told my physician that I had radiation, and he was saying that the radiation only comes out to about here. more than that. So I don't know. Who do I believe a Russian radiation detector or my physician? But anyway, the guy, I go pick him up. I said, well, because he had offered to loan it to me. So I said, OK, can I come pick it up? And went over there and going to take him out for some coffee or lunch or something like that. Because the doctor basically said, you can do that kind of stuff, but you just don't want to be like in enclosed space with somebody for like two hours. You don't want to be touching somebody. I hope there is no body watching this video. maxed out so anyway that's what's happening so I just wanted to show you that and show you that I'm not faking it because you couldn't fake something like that there's no way that you can get a little box like that push a button have it make that sound I mean it's just it's just impossible so it's actually actually do did take the pill so anyway I'm hella Rodney thanks for watching and thanks for all your support I'll see you later","Hey there, I'm hella Rodney.

Empezamos ya las sesiones de la tarde. Con la sesión titulada sobre sobre una adopción nacional cerrada que se abrió experiencias personales. La aponente que nos acompaña y que voy a presentar ahora es Kate, pero primero me gustaría decir muy brevemente que los congresos de afín y este ya es el El quinto, parece mentira, voy a ser el quinto, siempre desde el equipo de investigación de AFIN, los hemos considerado como un lugar donde compartir no solo los resultados de nuestras experiencias entre la gente que se dedica a la investigación, sino como un lugar abierto y de encuentro en el que se pudieran oír distintas voces, distintas experiencias que nos ayudarán a entender mejor las realidades en las que trabajamos y avanzar entre todos. ¿Qué es tu nombre? No sé si puedo decirlo. Es un caso especial de una adopción a una adopción nacional en Estados Unidos que nació con voluntad de ser cerrada que de hecho ella Kate como protagonista de la historia no inició una búsqueda de orígenes sino que prácticamente se encontró con sus orígenes y lo interesante yo creo que lo interesante de la experiencia de Kate de lo que nos va a hablar hoy eso es no tanto de la reconexión con con los vínculos bio genéticos sino de la construcción a lo largo de los años de una nueva relación con su familia de origen. A lo largo de los años estoy hablando ya de 17 años. No me voy a alargar más en la presentación, solo recordaros que por si no lo habéis visto, que aquí en la entrada en la mesa se vende el libro Lost and Found, que escribió Kate sobre su propia experiencia y que es realmente un libro muy, muy interesante.","Hello, good afternoon to all. We start the afternoon sessions with the session titled on a closed national adoption that opened up personal experiences. The speaker who accompanies us, and I will now introduce her to skate, but first I would like to say very briefly that the congresses of Afin and Estilla The fifth, it seems to be a lie, but it is the fifth. We have considered them as a place where we share not only the results of our experiences among the people who are dedicated to research, but as an open place and meeting in which different voices, different experiences could be heard that will help us understand better the realities in which we work and advance, among all, in these topics. The case of Kate whose name... I don't know if you pronounced the name correctly. The case of Kate, which some of you who follow the newsletters can finally hear you because recently she published a very beautiful text in our newsletter. It is a special case of a national adoption in the United States that was born with the will to be closed. In fact, she, Kate, as a protagonist of history, did not start a search for origins, but she practically found her origins. I think the interesting thing about Kate's experience, what she is going to talk about today, is not so much the reconnection with the bio-genetic bonds, but from the construction throughout the years of a new relationship with his family of origin. Throughout the years I've been talking for 17 years. I'm not going to go further in the presentation, just to remind you that, if you haven't seen it, that here at the entrance to the table you can see the book Lost and Found, which he wrote about his own experience, and it's really a very interesting book."

Welcome back and today we're gonna be taking a look at something really awesome and that is the tamper-proof bomb. Now I just want to get this out in the open before we start. This is not buildable in survival, which is way out of the ordinary for me. I usually orientate all of my creations around survival mode, but this time I thought I'd do something a little bit different and I thought this was well worth showing you because it's a really cool idea and it's a lot of fun to play with. Now I think it's safe to say this does exactly what it says on the table. There's no surprises here unless of course you didn't know it was there in which case you're gonna get a heart attack But essentially if you touch any of the blocks on this bomb, it's gonna blur itself to some of the reins We're gonna take a look at that now. Just take out this block here You'll see that our TNT falls and we get ourselves an almighty explosion spraying TNT everywhere completely obliterating the surrounding environment mental now for obvious reasons I'm not gonna be doing a tutorial on this one simply because it's not needed you You can just do it using MC Edit. So this one on the left is a ready-made one. It is primed with TNT. If you touch any of the blocks on that, then it's gonna blow itself up. However, the one on the right is filled with dirt. And that means that you can redesign the outside if you want to. If you don't like what I've got going on there. So you can get a completely new design and then you can hop into MC Edit and replace the dirt with TNT and then it will be ready to rock and roll.

I love that plug-in that's the only plug-in I know. how to use for stuff but I figured out a way to get it so if you guys want group manager it's a great plugin for managing your permissions you're just gonna want to go here and you're gonna want to find manager this is group manager right here you're gonna want to also see to go down hmm it would what did I find that it was group manage oh you're gonna want to sit here as a separate module.

I mean, you can take it all, but I suggest only those three. Now, for Essentials group manager, you're just gonna take both of them in, and now you have that. go to your normal thing and run your server I'm not going to show you how to use them, but now you have these little Folders here and they should work if they do not message me and I will try and fix it For you by making a video or something So yeah, I guess I'm also going to show you something I guess not. I'll show you in a different video Decisions Okay, I guess I'll show you this will also be a video on how to show you how to update your RAM so If your server is running a little bit slow, you're going to want to go into your little run file here. You're going to want to edit it. And this should pop up. And right here, you're going to want to delete that and put, if you have what I have, 2048. Because it just doubles it. 2048.

So the number one reason I joined is when I started I wanted to help one person achieve their goals. I wanted that one person to come to me and say thank you so much for helping me lose that last 10 pounds. for teaching me how to clean, eat, to feel better about myself, to put on clothes that I never thought possible I would wear again. I just wanted that gratitude, knowing that my efforts helped somebody. Helped somebody feel better about themselves when they weren't really feeling good. And that was my ultimate number one reason. My second reason was for myself. When I first started, I was super shy. I've always been shy, not that I won't talk or not that I'm a loner, but I am very quiet. I'm a quiet person. That's who I was. But in this business, you have to talk to people. You have to help them and you have to be yourself, open and honest. So this has really helped me step out of my comfort zone and be able to talk to people. It has helped me gain confidence that I really never had. I was always afraid of rejection. I'm always afraid people won't listen to me. So this has really helped me step out of my comfort zone. I have some big goals and big dreams that I've set for myself. And to get there I have to believe in myself. I have to push myself. And I have to do things I'm not comfortable doing. Like talking in front of people or making videos or anything else I can think of. So this business is stepping out of my comfort zone. And it is helping me grow. row is helping me see the bigger picture and it's helping me see down the future for what I want and how I can achieve it. And lastly, which is last, is the money. It's not really important and it's never been about the money for me. It's ultimately been about helping people but the extra cash is nice. I have made a dream board about two months ago and some of my goals were to set aside money for a townhouse to rent or ultimately buy a house eventually and a car payment one of the set aside a certain amount of money for a car payment and things like that and that has actually helped me. I have been able to put money away to save up for that townhouse or apartment that I find one that I never thought I could afford or it was too much money or I have actually I've actually been able to push my car payment back. I'm actually a whole month or two ahead on my car payments. So that's nice. That's something I don't have to worry about every month. Even though I do, just so it's done and over with, it has given me a little bit of financial freedom. I wouldn't say fully, but it has given me some financial freedom, which is nice. I've given you three reasons why I'm not giving you a little bit of financial freedom. Online what it has done for me and this coaching opportunity isn't for everybody It's not for everybody not everybody wants to do and that is totally fine But just know you don't have to be a health and fitness that you don't need to be a nutritionist You don't need to be a fitness strength You just need to do what works for you and you need to teach people What has worked for you and what hasn't worked for you and you just have to be inspirational and motivated and you ultimately in the end you just need to want to help people and if you want to help people and if you have big dreams then you can achieve anything you want to so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope you understand a little more on why I'm coaching and what it has done for me and if this is something you would like more informational please don't hesitate to contact me my information is all on here you can email me Facebook message me me whatever you need to do.

Sí, bueno, vamos a leerle un cuento a los chicos con Daniela, así que creo que eso también es una buena iniciativa, más allá de la deportiva, las actividades deportivas, los cumpleaños que siempre vemos. ¿Puedes ver algo diferente? ¿Qué hombre podría hacer y qué dosimo? así que miro revistas de afueras, de sopa, trabajo de otros emprendedores. En eso sí, no soy de libros sencillos, de drama, de función, o sea, sino más siempre lo mire el fútbol. Así que me ocupo más de eso.","What is your first initiative? It's a very important institution for the development of a culture that is truly important as a reading. A barino de lujo but two narrators of lujo. We saw it very well, reading it to the boys, it's practical. No, we have to practice inside. Ah, yes. In the test, I saw them nervous, they didn't want to fail the boys. No, it's not easy. Sometimes, to get to read a story, even if they're boys, when you're not well-educated, you do the type of activities, maybe you always have to put a I'm a little shy but when it comes to guys like Marten, who also has a hard time, he always says that it's easier to score goals than to get here to read the guys. And then he goes through the same thing, but thinking about the guys, we came to him very quickly. And did you like the story? Yes, very nice, very similar to the guy who told me about Marfa Lermos, he made half a leg, head, with the two legs, the truth is that they were going to optimize it, an optimistic goal. We are here with Daniel, he is going to accompany me to tell you about the event, but I hope he will. What was it? It was a story of the guys, with Daniel, but I think it was also a good initiative, moreover, sports, sports activities, the birthday parties, we always see each other. I think it's something different. What a man could do and what a second! I think you said you would kill him, you don't even have to read it. You know, you remember it. You liked it. Yes, no, but you have to read it so you don't get to read anything. And you're going to read it? How much? It's hard for me. I like to get better sometimes, more than anything, with the subject of football, the jobs, even if you want to get involved in something bad. The day after tomorrow, start directing and get involved with everything else. I read magazines, clothes, other entrepreneurs' jobs. I'm not a book reader, I'm just a drama, a fiction, I'm always the one who's playing football. I'm more focused on that."

A mudança faz parte de uma cobrança do Ministério Público Estadual que proibiu a exposição de carne de sol sem refrigeração. Os donos de açougues tiveram que se adequar, caso contrário, o estabelecimento poderia fechar as portas e o produto aprendido. Há cinco meses atrás, o Ministério Público detectou que a carne de sol em januária era comercializada desse jeito, exposta em ambientes abertos. Sujeita moscas e micro-organismos. Para adequar regras de higiene, o promoçor de justiça da época, Henrique Klein-Happel, reuniu os donos de açougues para um termo de ajustamento de conduta, evitando, assim, o comprometimento da saúde das pessoas. Após as devidas orientações, o Ministério Público voltou aos estabelecimentos para verificar se os assorbes cumpriram com determinado. O comerciante Marcos aprovou as medidas tomadas pela promotoria. Eu achei uma maneira boa, porque a higiene é outra coisa, né? O assorbo fica limpinho, você não vê mais inseto dentro, mosca, você não vê mais um bicho dentro, o assorbo. Para mim acho que foi bom, né? Tivei esse dinheiro aí, mas compensou porque a higiene é outra coisa, né? Para a gente também, para o consumidor, eu achei muito bom. Já esse outro comerciante estruturou seu ponto, mas não ficou satisfeito. Segundo ele existe outra maneira de expor a carne, sem que haja contaminação. refrigerado para colocar aqui para a carne de sol. Então eu acho que o exposto seco não vai ter problema, vai ser uma carne que vai estar tampada, ela vai estar totalmente fechada, mas ela não vai correr de estragar. Aluíse, disse ainda que a decisão irá acabar com a tradição da carne de sol de januária, além de trazer prejuízos. O que está trazendo prejuízos para os comerciantes de januário é que é o pequeno, não é o grande, somos nós o pequeno, é que nós não temos condição, a tradição de januária, como você mesmo sabe, há muitos anos que é a cançói exposta. Como acabou com isso, fechou a venda, aqui se continuada a maneira que vai, fecha a maioria dos açougueiros, como já tem vários fechados, inclusive aqui no mercado, você pode olhar, talvez não sei se é condição, mas o último açougueiro já parou, ele não teve condição, esse que não tinha condição, ele é adequado. Quer dizer, é um pai de família que já fica desempregado. O agente fiscal do PROCON preferiu não comentar sobre a observação do dono do assor, mas adiantou que a maioria dos proprietários está cumprindo com a ação. foi destruída, mas no geral a gente pode reparar uma menor considerável nos açougues e era essa nossa meta. carnes e derivados. De acordo com a pesquisa, não existe regulamentação que autoriza a exposição de carne de sol, carne de sereno, carne seca. Assim, a vigilância sanitária determina que somente pode ser exposta com refrigeração. O Ministério Público pretende, a partir de agora, cobrar a instalação de uma batedouro no município.","Who walks through January already notices that the city's suburbs are more modern. The change is part of a charge from the State Public Ministry that prohibited the exposition of sun meat without refrigeration. The suburbs owners had to adapt, otherwise the establishment could close the doors and the product was closed. Five months ago, the public ministry detected that the to verify if the stocks were met with a certain amount. The marketer Marcos approved the measures taken by the promoter. I think it's a good way because hygiene is another thing. The stocks are cleaned, you don't see any more insects inside, flies, you don't see any more bugs inside, stocks. For me, I think it was good. I had money but it was enough because hygiene is another thing. For us too, for the consumer, I think it's very good. This other merchant has already structured his point, but he was not satisfied. According to him there is another way to expel the meat without there being contamination. I'm trying to make a car and soul exposer without refrigeration and I'm not sure why, because the car and soul exposes in all closed life, it will not lose, it will not spoil, because we use it here and then it goes back to the freezer, I have a car available, the promoter can look, send a person to check in Irabela, which has a sunbed without regeneration, which is what I am wanting and that most people want, because not everyone has the condition to buy a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, a balcony, The refrigerator is for the sun.

The fiscal agent of the pro-con would rather not comment on the observation of the owner of the asset, but it has been decided that most of the owners are in charge of the asset. We are noting that there was a much better, much greater, in the assets, we did some changes, unfortunately, it was learned to lose 250 kilos of meat in the crop for consumption, The Ministry of Public Health adopted this measure in January after a study done by the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the FMG, the Graduate Science Institute, developed by Professor Rogério Marcos de Souza, a doctor in animal production and specialist in the area of technology and expansion of the country. and derivatives. According to the research, there is no regulation that authorizes the exposition of sun meat, serene meat, dry meat. Thus, the sanitary vigilance determines that only the response can be with the refrigeration. The Public Ministry intends from now on to charge the installation of a drummer in the municipality."

I think he appreciated today how hard we work and the kind of jobs that we've got and the lifting, the bagging and stuff is not as easy as what it looks. When I first started I got to tell you I was you know all arms and fingers. You've got to keep up because if you don't keep up the people around you have end up doing your work. It's about working together, teamwork. Yeah once you've got the hang of it When he was on the brum table he found that job was a lot faster than some of the other ones we did.

It's a fundamental part of our local economy. I know a lot of the people here and that was important for me to see firsthand and to feel it and do it. The union really helps us with our rights as workers. Whenever we need help, they're there either delegates on site or just ring them up and they're always there to support you and let you know what's going on.

Anh từ, muốn nhân phẩm, có nhân phẩm, muốn chỉnh độ, có chỉnh độ, muốn bản lĩnh, có bản lĩnh, cuối chạy đến cho em mưu cầu gì. Đó là ông trời cho người giúp đỡ em, em lại không nhận. Em một mực đòi kéo một nhành hoa, không ăn được, không uống được, chỉ để nhìn vô dụng kia về. Anh nói khó nghe rồi đấy, dừng lại đi. Điều đó có liên quan gì đến anh? Anh đừng nói linh tinh về một nhành hoa. Em phải đi ăn đây. Em không mở anh đâu. Anh lấy xe ra chỗ khác đi. Em bay qua xe anh mà đi. Ăn cơ mà. Con gái, món mang con thích ăn đây. Nào, để mẹ gắp cho. Ăn nhiều vào. Sao thằng 2 thì cũng xa rồi. Sao được nó là tốt. Mẹ thấy nhẹ cả lòng. Ngồi này màu tróng quay lại công ty nước ngoài của con đi. Ăn món này đi. À phải rồi, anh tử. Mẹ quen thân với bà con trên phố. Mẹ sẽ nhờ người tìm một anh chẳng bánh bao cho con. Anh tử của mẹ thế này. Mẹ không tin quả tú cầu này, lấy không va vào được chẳng hoàng từ bánh mã nào. Mẹ không nói nữa. Mẹ nói sai rồi. Được chưa? Ăn đi. Mẹ không nói nữa. Ăn món này đi. Anh tử, thưa lỗi cho mình. Bây giờ mình chưa thể trả lời câu hỏi của cậu được. Học quân muốn cậu đến công ty anh ấy làm. Cậu có đến không? Anh tử, anh hai, có việc gì không? Chị anh tử đi rồi. Tôi nói với cậu vậy. Tuần trước tôi và anh tử... à không, tôi vào một công ty hồng công gì đó định hợp tác một vụ làm ăn. Bới bản được một nửa, chưa xong. Công ty gì nhỉ? Hải gì đó, tôi không biết. Đây là lần đầu tiên tôi bản chuyện làm ăn với công ty ngoài đại lục. Hải gì nhỉ? Em cũng không biết. Chị anh tử biết. Cậu có ý gì?

Từ khi tôi biết yêu, trong trái tim đầy nhiệt huyết của tôi chỉ có một người đó thôi. Mười đó có phải là của tôi hay không còn chưa biết. Tôi là kẻ thô lỗ. Chút tình cảm của tôi chỉ dành cho một người. Cậu đã gặp ai chung chinh không thay đổi như tôi chưa? Nếu là người khác, họ đã bỏ tối theo sáng từ lâu rồi. Có ai nhìn thấy người cũ khóc nữa?

It was to do with a product in a supermarket that we got in England called ASDA. It is part of a Walmart group and one of the stock items that they carry was a Santoku catering knife. The question was Poo's, poised, where it was. Due to the fact that it looked quite thick, it was a carbon steel, would it make a good cheap bush knife? Now my local store just didn't carry a range of stock. But I did get something similar in Liddles. It looks a bit like that. But the only snag, good fun for me in the kitchen, the only snag was the holes that they put in the one that looked a good candidate, which to me was I'm quite happy to muck about my own little way and play around with those. I want to do something that was a good semi-serious sort of presentation on getting a hold of something that's easily available and can be converted reasonably easy into something that should perform reasonably well. The thing that we're all up against when getting hold of something cheaply and not necessarily the right product and then you're going to adapt it is there's so much available for not much money. You know, for 12 to 15 pounds you get yourself a really good mora. I've seen these for £4.11, more of 5.11. £4.11. The reissue, that's now you can't get old of them anymore. and price wait till they have a sale to use sir 25 pound okay it makes a mockery of the expensive blades like a wood lure and people are considering oh I can't get one of those and they may have a few of these and they want something a bit bigger maybe and they look at prices over knives and they're looking at the get-out clause so either I'm gonna prove this possible or I'm gonna prove that to be quite honest stick with what we know So what I have bought is a kitchen knife in stainless that is through tanged. It's not got a silly handle that disappears or is welded on. It's obviously been forged or ground. It has flush fitting handles and riveted through. Now, do I think that those rivets will last forever? No. Is it quite thick? Yes it is quite thick. A full flat grind I'm going to use the length available to make the shelf. So it becomes BK2-ish. Okay? So it should have a fair amount of cutting, it should have a fair amount of chopping, without that, in bush, almost pointless front end, because it hasn't got the weight, and it's all flat grind right down to there, and right down to nothing. You know, paper pen, it's for kitchen tasks. So it's keep a bit of weight, keep a bit of stock at that end. I've only got two and a half to three mil to start with. So lets forget about that and make some it shorter and stockier and see how it goes. So I'll cut the end off, select the adapted and see how it goes and I'll compare it with things around the price range. Not necessarily the size range because you can't compare that with a BK2 because it's 80 pounds. This is 4 pounds. So lets say for an investment of a tenner because you're going to have to make a make a really good sheaf out of it, some leather and then see how it performs. Do I think it'll perform on it? Yeah, I think it'll be fine. Okay? It'll be good. But it's not designed to work out in the bush. Which brings me onto the whole point of how bush knives would have maybe come about. Traders disappearing out into the world west would have used initially kitchen knives. That's what was available. quite prolifically and so a lot of the trade knives, dag knives, dog knives, whatever they were called, can't quite remember, were basically butcher knives of this sort of size, but carbon steel. This is stainless, you know, it'll be useful because it won't rust so easily. Okay, so let's give it a go, see how it gets on, and we'll either dispel the myth that you can't do it or we may be given some encouraging notes that actually, not a bad idea. Okay, so rather than just everybody rushing out and trying to save yourself a few quid instead of buying the real deal, okay? Oh, you're gonna go save yourself some pennies. Why are you gonna be wasting your time? Well, for the sake of four quid and a bit of effort, let me take the hit and I'll present it to you. So, Scott from Wessex Blades with us.

This tablet runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, it has a quad-core Tegra 3 processor, a 1280x800 screen, and enough extras to beat out the Google Nexus 7.","nexus 7, sero 7 pro, hisense sero 7, review, walmart, jelly bean, android",9694,64,10,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/HvUo-pk5lyU.mp3,"Hi everyone, I'm Nathan from theevilcreator.com I just posted a review of the Hisense Serial 7 Pro tablet so I thought I'd go ahead and put together this video review to give you guys a visual of everything to expect. So basically this is a new tablet from that's available over at Walmart. They seem to only sell it in stores for some reason or at least they only do as of this review. But I went ahead and picked up one of these a couple weeks ago. It's a lot like the Google Nexus 7 which has been probably the most popular This actually adds a lot of things that the Google Nexus 7 doesn't while maintaining the status quo of the Nexus 7. So far I've been impressed with this tablet. Let me go ahead and show you some of the hardware. This is what makes it more appealing than the Nexus. It actually has a micro SD card slot underneath this flap right here. We've also got a mini HDMI port so that you can stream your content to your TV. I test to both of those out and they do work fine. On the back we've also got a rear camera so you can take photos and it's even got a flash so that actually works pretty well. The flash is okay but I mean the camera works pretty well. So it also has the NFC chip back here so if you have another device that sports that you can just touch together right here and transfer content like web pages and photos and stuff like that. We've got two speakers down here. They work well. They're actually pretty loud. They sound decent. We've got the volume and power button right there and then we've also got a front facing camera in the corner. So as the functionality goes, it does add a few new features with the HDMI port and the microSD card slot and the rear camera compared to the Nexus 7. And it also has a lot of the same specs as the Nexus 7. So we've got the same sort of quad core processor. We've got the same amount of RAM. It's got only 8 gigabytes of memory, but since it's got the microSD card slot, it doesn't really matter so much since you can expand it. I mean, they both got the 1080 by 800 resolution screen. This is a great screen. I really like it. I think this is a little bit better than the Nexus 7 screen. The content is a little bit clear and I feel like the color is a little bit better. The one thing I would complain about with this screen is that the brightness dial really doesn't do a whole lot from low to high. So when I'm using this device at night, the lowest setting isn't even close to low. So I go ahead and use something like a screen filter app that goes ahead and dims it even more. Okay, so this device runs your standard straight up Android 4.2. We've got 4.2. 2.1 clear and crisp as far as reading text goes that is definitely an advantage with the higher resolution screens. Okay so like I said this device comes from Walmart and the only way you're really going to know that it comes from Walmart, it doesn't come with a lot of crapware on it or anything. It does come with the Walmart app and it comes with the Sam's Club app. So that's pretty much the only things that it comes with. It also comes with actually it comes with KingSoft Office which is a free office viewing and editing program and it works pretty well. I used it for a couple of documents and then it also came with a TV remote app. Android is you're gonna get on regular tablet the only tweak right here is we've got this extra icon over here And that's actually a screenshot icon so you can state take screenshots easily just by touching that That's not an icon that I've seen on other devices So it does make it a little bit easier just to take screenshots instead of trying to mess with hitting the power and volume buttons at the same time So I ran a couple of benchmark apps this thing it comes in at 41 25 on the quadrant score Okay, so for the most part I haven't had any issues with this device Being laggy or anything like that. We've got a nice fast quad core processor on here, so we shouldn't have any issues really We've got the different live wallpapers that doesn't even seem to slow anything down really so I tested a whole bunch of different games here to see what the performance would be like Everything runs nice and smooth. I really don't have any issues at all except for Nova 3 It's a little laggy, but then again, it's laggy on most tablets So I think that's probably just the app but far as these other games They're all nice and smooth. It's one of the benefits of the quad core processors. It definitely does have nice zippy smooth We got the widgets over here so if you want to add widgets to your home screen, we got the whole different kinds of setup. So it comes with this unique composite widget over here. This is one of the newer widgets just for the specific device. Hit the run button here. Here we go. It's over here. So it'll give you some different videos from that video app and then also you can access some other apps just quickly from here like the weather app and time app and stuff like that. As far as web browsing goes, it's nice and smooth. One thing I'm going to point out is One thing I really like about this tablet is the fact that the screen has no flickering whatsoever. For some reason I always had a little bit of screen flicker on my Nexus 7, especially apparent when the background was white like this when you're reading and you were scrolling on a web page, it would just flicker. I thought maybe a Tegra 3 had some issues with that, but this device doesn't have any flickering at all. So I do find it to be good for e-reading in that regard, since obviously the high resolution screen and the fact that the screen is so crisp and clear and doesn't have that flickering issue. you I was testing out the Bluetooth since this device has Bluetooth and the Bluetooth does work very well. It doesn't cut out in and out at all I had no issues with Bluetooth on this device at all So as you can tell with this game the volume of the speakers are actually really loud. It's got two speakers on the back. We go full volume. It's actually kind of crackly So this device also has GPS I find that it doesn't quite connect as well as the Nexus 7 for whatever reason But obviously I've got eight silly lights in view here, so it is working well It just took it a few minutes to actually connect here whereas the Nexus does the to go ahead and wrap up this review right here.

Peoples may have a below average budget with no major co-sign or record deal; but that hasn't stopped him from being one of the most consistent and efficient up and coming recording artists from the southwest. Although he has been involved with production, djing, mcing, and song writing for over a decade; it was only the top of this year he decided to push his talents to the next level.  In the past year, R.D. has dropped 5 free ""thematic projects"". These were put out with the intent to showcase lyrical and song writing abilities, and establish a presence amongst the many other artists trying to make a name in the industry. Along with this collection, he has also been featured on several mixtapes released under the world-renown Coast2CoastMixtapes.com umbrella. Though all releases were successful in their own right, R.D. Peoples does have his note-worthy moments.  R.D. Peoples first turned heads with a track from his ""Before We Begin..."" project; titled ""Dressed in all Black"". The isolated concept and unique flow and delivery balanced to near perfection over a thunderous and deviant beat. After he performed the track live, his fans gave him the moniker ""Mr. Dressed in all Black"", making the song a staple of his headlining performances; and taking it to a higher level of appreciation. Shortly after that same performance, R.D. laid a verse over an instrumental that was provided by a DJ who liked his style. The instrumental was a track from the Alchemist, titled ""That'll Work."" The verse was and still is a show stealing verse, many calling one of the top 5 verses ever recorded on the beat. Three projects followed ""Before We Begin..."", filled with memorable and satisfying material. However, his latest release ""For What It's Worth..."" is BY FAR his biggest, most anticipated and successful release to date. The project was intended to release June 29th, but the demand far exceeded what was initially expected. Because of this, it was released 9 days early on the Coast2Coast website; and within its first week obtained over 40,000 downloads and plays. Currently the project continues to maintain its success, showing no signs of slowing down. It is currently available on over 120 different websites, including GangstaGrillz.com, Thisis50.com, Hot97.com, and Datpiff.com.  Currently, R.D. is out performing, networking, and promoting his most recent effort. He is also planning/creating his 1st major EP. Look for his first single later this year.

Welcome to an afternoon of Technology with Michael Sowers, who is the Technology Innovation Librarian for the Nebraska Library Commission. For nine years prior to moving to Nebraska, he was the Internet Trainer for the Dipliographical Center for Research that's situated in Aurora, Colorado. He has been a public library trustee, a bookstore manager for a library friends group, a reference librarian, Cereal cataloger salt bookseller and has worked for the New York State Assembly He is also the webmaster for the grease New York historical society and also an amateur photographer My folks have photographs published in both domestic and international publications earned his MLS University Albany School of Information Science and Policy 1995 Michael's ninth book, Searching 2.0, will be out this summer. If you look on OCLC, it says there are actually six copies out there, but that's... I'm still editing so there you go. Nothing like writing a book about moving target. So, oh look, we changed our whole interface. Thank you. I have to rewrite my whole chapter. So, okay, we're going to do at the UNCL for a couple of years. Okay, you're going to see some of the same stuff. But keeping that in mind, I wanted to rearrange it a little bit, change it a little bit, and then something happened to me on Monday, which made me think about some other things. this morning I changed about third of this presentation. So you will hear some repeats, but the repetition stuff is good because that means it's the really important stuff of all of this. And I'm also starting to feel just a little cranky about some of this stuff. So when I came up with this title I just called it lead following it out of the way. Trying to get a point across there. We'll see what happens as we go through this. So my job is technology innovation library. What the heck does that mean? This is what I think that job title means. At least that's what it means to me, is to question everything. I'm not necessarily here to say that everything has to change, but we need to be going through a period of asking ourselves, why do we do it this way? Is it still gonna work? Does it need to change? Should we be trying something else? So I'm the guy who goes into somebody's office and knocks on the door and says, okay this, yeah. Why do we do it that way? And hopefully you can explain it. If you can't even explain it to yourself or to a co-worker, how are you going to explain it to your patrons? How are you going to explain it to a boss? How are you going to explain it to the person who can't understand why the heck you do it that way? Because things are changing and things are changing very fast. I took this photo in Washington, DC a couple of weeks ago. I was in the metro and I just changed it to Zuma Land. I'm thinking, ooh, metaphor. Things are changing really, really fast. are you in relationship to this train? Are you standing next to it watching it zoom by? Maybe, maybe not. Are you on the train? Good place to be I would think at this point. But then there's some of you, I don't know who you are, you're probably this. Which you feel like you're kind of in front of the train, poking furiously, trying to get out of the way. This by the way, it's a great flicker, said this guy just takes his little start a group or Lego figures and just puts them in all sorts of situations. It's like life of trooper or something. I don't know. It's hilarious. I thought this one works well with my metaphor here. Hopefully, really where I'm trying to get people is actually on the train. And hopefully you also like where that train is going. Now, what happened to me on Monday? And so, I don't have this well planned out. if I can see my little heads and make her white. This is Diana. Diana is 18 years old. She is graduating from high school. We have finals week this week in Colorado. And she got a letter from this fine institution on Monday saying you've been accepted. Don't know if she's going to end up coming here, but there's a very, very good chance. So suddenly I'm a little more interested, because this is my girlfriend's daughter, as to how this place runs. And so I started thinking about how she does things and what gizmos and gatchas does she use and how does she communicate and like to be honest I can't remember ever hearing her say in the last three years that she's gone into the school library. I know she doesn't go to the public library although there's not exactly one convenient to where they live but you know I still got some library when I was a kid. So this is your student come this fall and I know you already have this but this So, let's talk about some of these issues involved. And I've already kind of touched on this one already, is, you know, are we locked into the old ways? Please notice the blank lock there. Why do we do what we do? Have you ever heard yourself answer the question, why do you do it that way, because it's always been done that way? Have you ever heard yourself answer the question, well, you know, why don't we change how we do it? What are some of the bad answers to the question, how about we try this other way? What are some of the answers you've ever heard that might have frustrated you? I don't know how to do that. Don't know how? Okay. We already tried that. Already tried that. What if it doesn't work? What if it doesn't work? What's the best response to that one? Well, what if it doesn't? We're going to talk about that one. That's a good one. That's a good one. We'll throw another department off their game. Any other ones? I'm always looking for new ones. If you hear yourself giving these answers, stop yourself, please. We don't have the budget. I'd love the Les Formes Committee. I'm definitely going to come back to that one. So, you know, when I hear answers like that I think of this. Just because you've always done it that way doesn't mean it's not incredibly stupid. I mean, for real. We've always done it that way is not a good reason. There have been, okay, this is what happened to me, this also happened to me one day, I was in a meeting and, well, last week I was giving a different version of this presentation a little more of the one that I gave at UNC Alabama Library 2.0. I had mentioned that years ago there was this big debate about this new technology and how it was going to affect libraries and whether or not we should use this piece of technology to perform reference services to our patrons. The piece of technology was called a telephone. We've kind of gotten over that right? We now provide services over the telephone. On Monday I'm in a meeting hearing about you know I understand we have rural libraries in the state. I got that. But there are libraries in the state that don't have a telephone. And I just kind of like, huh. I'm trying to get the Wi-Fi and they don't have a phone yet. So that was kind of a little bit of a wake up call to me. But what is challenging our tradition? Why do we have to change? You guys are running into this way more than I am. This is what's making us have to change. That is a 37 inch flat panel television connected to an Xbox 360 running at 80 laptop computer running Rootscape on his lap iPod in one headphone the headset going in on the other one so he can talk to his friends either on Xbox Live or the computer I'm not sure which one that's connected to and just in case he's got a cell phone there waiting for him if he gets a text message or somebody calls okay these are your students these are your patrons Did anybody there was, and I couldn't dig up the video I wanted to steal from it, there was an Obama post primary speech a couple of weeks ago.","Good afternoon.

And I just kind of like, huh. I'm trying to get the Wi-Fi and they don't have a phone yet. So that was kind of a little bit of a wake up call to me. But what is challenging our tradition? Why do we have to change? You guys are running into this way more than I am. This is what's making us have to change.

Journalisten har gått en termin och vi har undersökt vad de tycker om utbildningen. Häng med. Journalistlinjen är jättebra. Det är väldigt intensivt. Det är mer än vad man tror när man börjar. Det är många långa dagar och intensiva veckor. Speciellt intensiva veckorna. Då vi fördjupar oss verkligen i en hel vecka jobbar med ett handtverk. Redigering, foto eller radio. Det har varit det mest lärorika sen när jag började där. Det är jättetrevligt att skola, ju, en kildefolkare. Jag trivs hur bra som helst. Skolomustik har väl vänt att ösa med väldigt länge. Att jag var en kildefolk var att själva antagningen var väldigt trädlig. Det gjorde ett väldigt bra intryck. Intensiv veckorna. Det är då jag har lärt mig mest och har känt att jag utvecklades. Det här halvåret som jag har gått nu har lärt mig mer än vad jag har gjort någonsin tror jag. Det har gått så himla snabbt på något sätt. Om jag tittar tillbaka så känns det som... Jag kan inte riktigt dela på saker och ting åt en enda stor rör av massa nya intrycker. Jag tycker att jag har lärt mig väldigt mycket och träffat många nya kompisar och haft väldigt skoj i den här terminen som gick jättesnabbt verkligen. Sen är det klart att Jordine mindre än var det här på universitetet men till ett sånt här yrke tycker jag att det passar perfekt och har såhär mycket praktisk erfarenhet. Det är en del av det här.","Welcome to Jun Chile Folkhögskola. The journalist has reached a term and we have examined what they think of the picture. The journalist line is very good. It is very intensive. It is more than what you think when you start. It is many long days and intensive weeks, especially intensive weeks. We really work with one hand at a time.

It is very intensive. It is more than what you think of when you start. It is many long days and intensive weeks. We work with a lot of work in a week. That's what I've been most learning and rich with since I started there. It's a really nice school, young girls and people in school. I really like it. The school of chemistry has been with me for a very long time. Being young was a very nice thing. It was a good impression for me. The intensive weeks. That's when I've learned the most and I feel I've been developed. And this half a year that I've gone now, I've learned more than I've ever done. It's been so fast, if I look back, it feels like I'm part of things. There are a lot of new impressions, I think I've learned a lot, met many new friends and I've had a lot of fun in this tournament, which went really fast. Of course, Jordyn was smaller than I was at the university, but for a like this, I think it fits perfectly and has a lot of practical experience. The End"

And I have teams with almost every other formation.   If you guys would like a tutorial on what quality a player should have for a 4-1-2-1-2 formation write on the comments below and I would love to make a more detailed tutorial on this formation. The next formation will be 4-3-3. Stay tuned!  Follow me on:   Any questions about the game? a particular move and how to do it? Write on the comments below and don't forget to like the page!

I'm a real Madrid fan and I figured I would start there. I didn't know a lot about food but throughout this month and a half I've learned a lot and I want to show you exactly what I've learned. 4.1.2.1.2 is a formation in which you create place. You're strong defensively as you can be offensively depending on the way you attack. If you want to make good plays and you know you can create good plays, you like to keep the ball, you like to share the ball, get it back and then span to your strikers, this is the formation for you. I know there are many ways that you can play, but specifically right now in this tutorial we'll focus on the 4-1-2-1-2. Again, 4-1-2-1-2 is defensive because of your center of offensive mid and your 4 backs as it is attacking mid with your center of attacking mid. 1-2-1-2 Pedro and Di Maria in this case your left mid and your right mid respectively and also to your strikers. Kedira's passing is not as good and I'll focus on Kedira a little bit more. He has 73 passing not so good. You have Modric, he has 86 passing. He is key to create chances for Falcao, Benzema, chip shots, even shooting. He's pretty damn good. Okay perfect. Now we're gonna go over some clips. in which I show you guys how to use the 4.1.2.1.2, how to share the ball and create plays specific to our topic. Later on I will do a tutorial and how and in which players you guys should use to pretty much expand the use and the potential of your 4.1.2.1.2 formation. As you can see here you don't really need to rush the ball, plays will be made, get it out right there, getting involved in the play, however still dropping, water is going up he should be able to do that videos. What I'll do is make reviews specifically of the players that you should have in each position. So if you guys would like to see that, please like the video and let me know in the comments below.

But I don't need him to win a lot of headers because he's creating plays. And he's quick on his feet. He's 78 pace, which is perfect because you don't want to rush your play. You don't want to be too slow either. You want to be able to run away from the people that are attacking you. And you also, at the same time, you want to escape. 4-1-2-1-2 formation is purely about creating plays.

The record setting 180 Pokemon booster packs, so I have two Majestic Dawn packs left. I'll open that up. Hopefully I get another level, I've only gotten one full box so far. I've gotten a one on average in each box, so I thought that you could get two, but looks to me like you only get one. Okay, we have a Shallost EC Helix fossil. I'm going to take a look at that and put that in my kingdra. An unknown pea. Oh, unknown pea is trash but then Polian makes up for it. One more pack. Let's see if I can level up. Hopefully I at least get a good rare or reverse hollow. Okay, we have a Hippopotas. Kipwup. I wouldn't mind another Empolian. Baneeri. Burry. Sandy cloak, crow gunk, ambipam, dust ball trainer, pseudo widow, glamia reverse, and a pheon. Not very good. Oh well. Pretty good box other than the level X. I got the poor Genzi in the whole box. Alright, we'll move on to my legends awaken box. Then I have the storm front box next. Hopefully I get something good. There we are. I opened one of these boxes in my other videos on YouTube. I did okay in it. I think I did actually get two level axes in there. Maybe a... I think I got an A-Zelf and an OOXY level axe. Ah, maybe a Mestran, I'm not sure. Open those up, open for something good. I don't even know there's a lot of legendaries in this set. Maybe a Kyogre, open for those. Reggie Ice for a tech card for my King of Death. Okay, we have a Chinchaw, Relief, Pollywag, Hitman Chan, Gloom Lucario seems like I have all these probably because I do lanterns box training which is actually a pretty decent supporter Swallot reverse and a king girl. Well, there's a king girl right away That's a good start to the box because I what do I have two Kingers there? I might pump bump it up to three I'm not sure I'll take a look at my deck and actually see that I have but King is really good if you haven't Haven't seen that that card says you take a look at it sometime. Okay, we have a Letty buff Splink, Cubone, Baneery, Root Fossil, Toros, Merowack, Unknown Y, Delcateryverse, and then Armaldo. That's the card I was hoping for right there too. Because I have a deck of those. That card has a Poke Body I think it is. If your opponent's Pokemon can't do more than 60 damage, the attack's damage doesn't affect Armaldo. deck around. sponk chincho persian loxio unknown r drift flim reverse so uncommon and a metagross there's another good rare so what are these three packs up three packs been pretty good like I said in some of my earlier videos I have no idea where I'm put all these cars that I have I barely have enough room as it is but pynico polywirl nose pass skiddy execute loxio Seedra, Pokeradar, Numo Reverse, and a low-punny. I actually opened for a few more bucks training out here. It's a supporter. You draw two cards and then once the turn you play that your Pokemon's attack is 10 HP more. It's a pretty decent supporter. Okay, we have a Beldom, Weepin' Bell, Pollywag, Execute, Riolu, Unknown W, Dragonair. That's the one I was hoping for Dragonite. So Lantern, remind me of it. Deoxys Attack form, Reverse, which is a rare. Kyogre, there's one that I was looking for. That's good. Hopefully get one more of those. Couple Dragonites would be nice. One of its moves. Still, I think it's more energy. It's quite a bit. It does 50 damage. Okay, you go through every one of your opponent's Pokemon. You flip a coin, if it's heads, it does 50 damage to that Pokemon. So, Pineco, Oddish, Horsey, Tyrogue, Taylo, Unknown Jay, Tentacruel, Toros, Reverse Victory Bell, which is a rare, and then Azoff, Love-Lax. Nice Love-Lax. I think that's the second one of those I have, but oh well. One Love-Lax is better than none. I'm hoping for maybe a Glyce or a Love-Lax in this. I really won't use it that much, but I think I have all the other Love-Laxes in this set already. Okay, we have a Letty buff. Hitmon top. Astridus. Jatini, Swellow, Glycor, Unknown Question Mark, Baneeria Reverse, and a Fortress. Hopefully, since I got that level X so early in the box, I'm not even close to halfway through it, I'll get another one. Okay, we have a Houndur, Encada, Oddish, Swinog, Hitman Lee, Unknown R, Tentacruel, Matang, Polytoad Reverse, which is a rare, Necrodont. okay back to where it's always nice dragon knight i'm hoping for okay we have a bell sprout tentacle hitman top dratini driftwoon swallowt anirith houndoom unknown r reverse and a luxray i don't think i got one of those my whole box last time so a luxray hollow that's nice hoping for a ray claws as well i didn't get one of those last box or a yen mega because i think this legend's awake and set This one is the bigger Pokemon set they have out there. There's a lot of cards in it. I don't have a grass deck together. That's a pretty good card. It's a good spread damage deck card. I might be able to put that together if I get a couple more. Okay, we have about 25 seconds to open this back. should be able to do it. Gligar, execute, Meowth, Shinks, Polywag, Dragonair, hoping for a Dragonite, Castorm Snow Cloud form, Techno Machine TS1, Drift Loon Reverse, and a Dragonite. Well, the two packs are all the Yanmega and this Dragonite. As you can see that Draco Meteor is that one that does 50 damage to each Pokemon if you flip the coin of its head.

Meine Primärwaffe ist diesmal die MPL mit Dual Max und ich nenne die MPL auch Mickey Mouse. Der Grund? Ja ganz einfach. Die MPL und die Mickey Mouse sehen sich doch sehr ähnlich oder nicht? Also diese zwei Metallteile die sehen doch so aus wie die Ohren von der Mickey Mouse oder nicht? Also mir ist das gleich beim ersten mal aufgefallen wo ich diese Waffe gezockt habe. Jedes mal wenn ich diese Waffe zocke muss ich immer ein Mäuse denken. Also, Maus, Maus, Maus, Maus, Maus, Maus, Maus und mir geht einfach die Maus nicht aus dem Kopf, weil ich die ganze Zeit diese Waffe von meiner Fresse hab. Also, nicht dass es mir jetzt keinen Spaß macht diese Waffe zu zocken, aber bei mir geht irgendwie so ein Maustick durch, wenn ich die MPL spiele. Schreibt es in den Kommentaren, ob es euch auch so geht. Also ich weiß nicht, mir ist das gleich beim ersten Mal aufgefallen. Die MPL ist eine kleine süße Maus. Ja, ähm... Ich zocke hier auf Summit mit der MPL und ich muss sagen, die MPL auf Summit ist gar nicht so schlecht wie man denken würde. Also man denkt normalerweise ja die MPL ist genauso schlecht wie die Mini Uzi, nein nicht die Mini Uzi, sondern die Uzi und die PM 63, obwohl diese Waffen sind eigentlich gar nicht so schlecht, das ist nur ein Vorurteil. Aber man sieht schon diese Waffe verzieht kaum. Man muss halt nur ein bisschen damit umgehen können und vor allem mit dem Visier von der MPL. Das ist ein bisschen gewöhnungsbedürftig. Man sollte auch ein bisschen defensiver spielen als normalerweise. Weil normalerweise ist das Magazin nicht so groß. Das sind normalerweise 20 Schuss. Und ich habe hier Plünderer Pro dabei. Also heißt das mein Magazin ist von Anfang an größer. Das verschafft mir einen sehr sehr großen Vorteil mit der MPL und ihr werdet mich auch manchmal sehen wie ich hier zwei Leute auf einmal wegsprayen werde. Und das ist schon etwas besonderes mit der MPL. Ja, ich möchte auch nicht weiter über das Gameplay reden, sondern ich möchte euch heute die Frage beantworten, wie ich denn auf das Kommentieren gekommen bin. Ja, fangen wir mal an. Die Geschichte fing an. Es war einmal vor langer Zeit der kleine M-Core der 14 Jahre alt war. Ja, ich habe damals in diesem Alter mit 13 oder 14 habe ich angefangen mich für Photoshop zu interessieren. Und dann kam natürlich auch das Video, Ich habe im November 2009, also vor zwei Jahren, Was ist das für ein Community-Channel? Ich habe mich auf den Channel Dorp erstellt. Ich habe meine erste Kommentare geladen. Nach zwei Wochen ist das MonoWaffer 2 erschienen. Ich weiß nicht, ob ich wirklich der erste deutsche Kommentator bin. Ich will auch hier nicht damit angeben. Aber ich wollte es nur mal so erwähnen. Ja, das ist ja schon vorbei, aber ich rede jetzt einfach mal weiter. Da haben wir auch Videos hochgeladen. Ich habe kommentäre hochgeladen. Ich habe Videos hochgeladen. Alles, was es gab. Also vor allem Commentaries. Dieser Channel hatte dann zum Zeitpunkt wo Tio 100 Abonnenten hatte, dieser Channel hat 380, ihr könnt euch vorstellen wie das jetzt aussehen würde. Also ich weiß jetzt nicht, wie das jetzt wirklich aussehen würde, aber ihr könnt euch mal die Ausmaße vorstellen. Und dann wurde dieser Channel von einem Klamik-League gelöscht, weil wir mit diesem Klamik-League ein bisschen Stress hatten, also ein bisschen zoff. Und das war halt ein bisschen kindisch. Er war nicht so alt, aber ich habe sehr viele schlechte Erfahrungen mit jüngeren Zockern gemacht. Ja, es... ja, reinbringen in die commentary. Aber das kommt irgendwie so eingebaut in die commentary vor. Kommt zumindest mir so vor. Ja, so ihr habt die Geschichte von mir gehört. Das war es von mir. Servus bis zum nächsten Mal. Ach ja, daumen hoch, wenn es euch gefallen hat. Servus.","Hello guys, I'm Jan and this time I have a team deathmatch for you. My primary weapon this time the MPL Medulmax and I call the MPL also Mickey Mouse. The reason? Yes, very simple. The MPL and Mickey Mouse look very similar, right? So these two metal parts look like the ears of the Mickey Mouse, right? So I noticed that at the first time where I pulled this weapon. Everytime i play this weapon i have to think about mice. Mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse I play with the MPL on the SUMIT and I have to say the MPL is not as bad as you think. The MPL is not as bad as the Mini Uzi, although the weapons are not as bad as the Pm63. But you can see that the weapon is not very good. You just have to be able to handle it. This is a bit of a habit and you should play defensively because normally the magazine is not that big. There are usually 20 shots and I have a blunderer pro here, so that means my magazine is bigger from the beginning. This gives me a very big advantage with the MPL and you will see me sometimes how I will suddenly spray away two people here and that is something special with the MPL. I don't want to talk about the gameplay, but I want to answer the question how I got to the comments. Let's start! I also have the time when I was interested in the internet and the computer. Before that I only played Gameboy or something like that. Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS. Then I looked around on YouTube and watched some videos. Then I looked at some Photoshop tutorials. Then I got the idea why you don't actually create your own tutorial channel. So with 3 red warnings the account was locked Nowadays copyrighted material is loaded, you get a yellow warning and this warning does nothing. Then this channel was deleted. But this channel started with the commentaries. I have to tell you something about that. I have been in November 2009, so two years ago. Well, that's a bit over a year, almost two years. I bought MonoWaffer 2. Before that I already bought MonoWaffer 1. But then I only bought it on alarm part. I just found it cool. Then I got MonoWaffer 2. I looked around on YouTube again. If there are some tutorials. How I was used to Photoshop. Machinima is a community channel like German Taters. This channel had 100 subscribers at the time. This channel had 380. You can imagine how it would look like now. I don't know if I would really look like this now, but you can imagine the dimensions. This channel was deleted from a Klamik League because we had a little stress with this Klamik League. So a little bit tough. That was a bit childish. Yes, I'll put it in the comments. But it's somehow built into the comments. At least it's like this. So you heard the story from me. That was it from me. See you next time. Oh yes, thumbs up if you liked it."

We don't spend a lot of time in teaching grip. What we're more concerned about is the tightness of the sparrow that the young man has and the velocity in which he can throw the ball. But if we have a young man who's having difficulty with the grip, we suggest that we take the second finger of the throwing hand and place it over the top thread on the ball, and then we would like to get that second finger, the third finger, on the second. threat of the ball to give him a good secure grip at the back of the ball and that's the type of grip that we suggest. Gripping a football is much like shooting a foul. If a youngster is not having any difficulty with his throw, if he's got good rotation on the ball, if he's got good velocity on the ball, we're not going to mess with the grip. And during the period of time that we've been here at the University of Maryland, we've only had to change the grip of one of our quarterbacks. And now I'm going to allow the other quarterbacks to give you some insight as to how they grip the football. important thing about having a grip is making sure that it's comfortable. Myself, I like my ring finger at the top of the laces and my pinky right here in the middle. At times I will change my grip a little bit because in the NFL, especially during game day, we play with 12 brand new football. So you never know how the texture of the football is going to be in some are a little bit oilier and some are a little bit more slippery. So I think a lot of that has to depend on where I'm going to put my fingers. But for right now, I would say when I pick up a football, I immediately put my ring finger right here and my pinky right here. And this way I can cock When you're gripping the football, I don't think you want to get too much of your palm on the ball. Sometimes I've seen players try to get grip like that and you don't have quite as good a touch with that type of grip. You want to get something that's comfortable and maybe gives you a little air right underneath here and it gives you better touch when you're throwing those touch passes. Another thing that I might mention is the tightness of your grip. I know it's up in Buffalo, we've been playing in the playing some pretty heavy winds and at times when you're thrown into a 30 or 40 mile an hour wind I tend to tighten my grip up just a little bit with my fingers a little more tension and it gives me a tighter spiral into the wind whereas if it's a calm day I'll just loosen it a little bit and I feel I have just a little bit better touch.","Starting with the basics, we're going to first introduce the grip that we suggest at the University of Maryland.

Comencemos. Número 10. Juntero. Es un gran enemigo que parece un reptil, y esquivarlo no es muy fácil, es como un reptil mutado con el virus, aparece en Resident Evil 1, en Resident Evil Código Verónica, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis y, en otros que no recuerdo, su ataque es medio, mide un metro y medio de alto aproximadamente, te ataca con sus silosas y ahora metiéndose al suelo y sabiendo donde menos te lo esperas para atacarte. 7. Iron Maiden. Es un regenerador pero con espinas que les salen del cuerpo para atacarte. Es muy difícil de eliminar si tienes armas sencillas ya que si le despedaces una parte del cuerpo le vuelve a crecer. Por eso se llama regenerador. Aparece en Resident Evil 4 en pocas ocasiones. Su ataque es medio, mide dos metros de alto. Su forma de atacar es cuando estén cerca de él, alarga sus espinas y que las encaja, también se agarra de ti y te mueve. Es el enemigo que más me dio terror en Resident Evil 4, porque vas caminando por un pasillo y se escucha la respiración del aeron Maiden y a la vuelta del pasillo de repente aparece a... a... a... Xt. Número 6. Bandage Snatch. Es un monstruo con un solo brazo pero muy bien desarrollado ya que lo puedes tirar hacia ti aunque estés muy lejos aparece en Resident Evil Código Verónica, su ataque es medio, su estatura es de 2 metros, su forma de ataque es cuando está cerca de ti, te agarrará y te exprime la cabeza, y, de lejos quedan manazos. para atacar que da con la cuchilla de gacha con la parte de atrás que es como un mazo o te agarrar el cuello te lanza al piso y te da un hachazo. Nota, es el mejor enemigo de Resident Evil 5, número 4, Licker o en español, Lameror. Es un gran monstruo más caminando por un vasillo y de repente te cae el techo o en el lugar donde menos te lo esperas en Resident Evil 2, eso me hizo saltar del susto en muchas ocasiones, tiene expuesto el cerebro, tiene unas guerras enormes y afiladas y una larga lengua aparece principalmente en Resident Evil 2 y Resident Evil 5 ataque medio tamaño como una persona su forma de ataque es dándote garazos atacándote con su lengua y tiene el mismo ataque que el junter brinca y te da un garazo en la cabeza nota es el mejor enemigo que no es un jefe El número 1 aparece en residente EVI 3 Nemesis. El no tiene labios ni el ojo del lado derecho. Está armado con un lanzacohetes. Nemesis tiene 3 fases. Esta es la fase 1. Su ataque es medio. Su estatura es 2 metros. Su forma de ataque. Golpeándote, atacándote con su lanzacohetes. Y agarrandote y encazándote su pentáculo en tu cráneo. Esta fase ya no está armado con su lanza cohetes, su ataque es medio, su estatura es de 2 metros, su forma de ataque, golpeándote con sus tentáculos como si fueran látigos. y si te acorrala despide de este mundo. atacan, sus garrajos son extremadamente de amigos. Y ahora, lo que todos estaban esperando, el fabuloso número uno es, William Wilkin, es el mejor enemigo en todo Resident Evil, lo que me gusta de este enemigo es su dificultad y sus múltiples diseños, ya que este enemigo muta de diferentes formas durante todo el juego, y lo que más me gusta de anontones es, su ojo que tiene en su hombro derecho, que es lo que lo hizo notarse, bueno esta es su primera mutación, esta mutación solo apaga Aparece en las partidas con la letra B, ataque medio, tamaño, dos mezos de alto, forma de ataque, está armado con un tubo, y si te alcanza te baja un buen puño de vida, mutación 2. En esa mutación la cabeza de William Birkin defiende hasta el pecho, y otra cabeza la sustituye, y en el pecho se ve puede ver que le salen dos brazos, ya no está armado con un tubo, su brazo derecho junto con el ozo crecen, y de la mano le salen unas abogadas garras. con la letra pa. Ataque alto, tamaño medio de alto, forma de ataque. Cuando está cerca de ti te dará razos, aunque solo te haga eso, quita mucha vida. Mutación 3. Se puede ver que la cabeza de William desapareció y la otra cabeza se ha desarrollado más. Los brazos se demovieron para la espalda y los que tenía en el pecho ahora son sus nuevos brazos y del pecho le crecieron unos dientes. Le creció uno fue en la pierna y en la espalda, solo que el de la espalda no se le puede ver. convierte en una cosa de forme con cadáveres incursados en el cuerpo esta es la mutación más fácil de derrotar ya que solo se muere como con ocho balas de maglum esta mutación solo aparece en las partidas con la letra de ataque alto, tamaño enorme, forma de ataque solo te golpea con sus tentáculos aunque casi no lo suza por eso es muy fácil derrotarlo. Recuerden que lo escucharon primero de Silent Hill 25-15 hasta mi próximo vídeo ¡Cuidense!","I am Isael2515 and today I bring you my video, my top 10 best enemies of Resident Evil. Let's start. Number 10. Juntero. He is a great enemy that looks like a reptile and it is not very easy to dodge him. He is like a reptile mutated with the virus. He appears in Resident Evil 1, in Resident Evil 3, in others that I do not remember, his attack is half, and of a meter and a half of height approximately, he attacks you with his silences and now you are getting on the ground and knowing where you least expect to attack you. Number 8 U-8 is a kind of crustacean, like a spider with a hood, has long legs with which it is held to the wall. It appears in Resident Evil 5 when you go down by a round elevator, its attack is high, its size in meters I do not know, I just say that it is enormous, its attack form is, giving you the reason or throwing small insects that attack you. The next is the 7th. The Iron Maiden. He's a regenerator, but with spines that come out of the body to attack you. It's very difficult to eliminate if you have simple weapons, since if you break it, it's part of the body that grows again. That's why it's called regenerator. He appears in Resident Evil 4 on few occasions, his attack is medium, and he's 2 meters high, his attack form is... When he's near him, he's going to throw his spines and he fits them in, he'll also grab you and he'll kill you. Note. This is the enemy that most scared me in Resident Evil 4 because you walk through a corridor and you hear the breathing of the Iron Maiden and the turn of the corridor suddenly appears to... XT. Number 6. Bandage Snatch. He is a monster with a single arm but very well developed since he can stretch it towards you even though he is very far away. He appears in Resident Evil Code Veronica, his attack is medium, his height is 2 meters, his attack form is... When it is close to you, it will grab you and squeeze your head, and, from far away, it will be a bad guy. Number 5. Verdugo is a guy who, due to a giant axe, appears in Resident Evil 5 on two occasions, the first starting almost the game in the town of the aliens, and, the second, in the mini-game of the mercenaries in the prison scenario, but this second time it appears dressed in another way and his axe is caught in flames, his attack is high, and is 2 meters high, To attack, you hit the trigger with the back part, which is like a knife, or grab the neck, throw it to the floor and it gives you a hit. Note, it is the best enemy of Resident Evil 5, number 4, Flicker, or in Spanish, the best. It is a great monster, walking through a void and suddenly the roof falls, or in the place where you least expect it, in Resident Evil 2, that scared me a lot, it has exposed the brain, He has huge and sharp claws and a long tongue, mainly appears in Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 5. Attack, medium, size, as a person, his form of attack is giving you arms, attacking with his tongue and he has the same attack as the Hunter, play and give you a head-on. Note, he is the best enemy that is not a boss. Number 3 Nemesis, he was before my favorite enemy but not anymore. Number 1 appears in Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. He does not have an eye or an eye on the right side. He is armed with a rocket launcher. Nemesis has three phases. This is phase 1, his attack is medium, his stat is 2 meters, his attack form, hitting you, attacking you with his rocket launcher, and grabbing and hunting you his pentacle in your skull. Phase 2, in that phase, Nemesis no longer has a shirt and she can appreciate her tentacles. This phase is no longer armed with its rocket launch, its attack is medium, its status is 2 meters, its attack form, hitting you with its tentacles as if they were bats, phase 3, in this phase an M disappears in its human form and becomes a kind of monster or deforme, its attack is high, its size is 2 meters high and 4 meters long approximately, its attack form is hitting you with its tentacles, throwing acid and if you run away, say goodbye to this world. Attack, his tanks are extremely good friends. And now, what everyone was waiting for, the fabulous number one is William Wilkin, he is the best enemy in all Resident Evil, what I like about this enemy is his difficulty and his multiple designs, since this enemy mutates in different ways throughout the game, and what I like most about him a lot is, his eye that has his right shoulder, which is what made him adapt, well this is his first mutation, this mutation only appears The game appears with the letter B, middle attack, size, two meters high, attack form, it is armed with a tube, and if you reach it, a good punch drops you, mutation 2, in that mutation the head of William Birkin defends the chest, and another head sustains it, and in the chest you can see that two arms come out, it is no longer armed with a tube, his right arm together with the bone grows, and the hand comes out in a wide grip, this mutation only appears in the games with the letter pa high attack, medium height, attack form, when it is close to you, it gives you arms, although it only makes you do that, it takes a lot of life, mutation 3, you can see that the head of william disappeared and the other head has developed more, the arms moved to the back and those who had in the chest now are their new arms and from the chest some teeth grew, one grew in the leg and in the back, only the one on the back can not see this mutation The teeth of the chest creak him, it's like fighting against a zombie dog. This mutation only appears in the games with the letter A. High attack, size 2 meters high and 3 meters long approximately, attack form, close to him, grabs you with his huge mouth, thicc and slings you, from far away jumps towards you and falls over you, when he falls over you and takes your life, occurring towards you and when he comes with you, he bites you, final mutation, loses all its shape, and falls Remember that you heard it first from Saiden Hill 25-15, until my next video. Take care."

I mean I'm lucky enough to kind of call it work. I mean the Radio Studio six days a week. I'm DJing. I like to play on music production software you know. I mean it is pretty much everything in my life. It's a hobby, it's work. Having the Sonal System in the house is a revolution. I can be like in the bedroom just listening to what I want. My girlfriend's in the kitchen making some food. listening to what she wants and I can come home and say I heard this amazing track today, stream it through the Spotify and you know just blast it through the house. My first greatest track on earth is Nirvana, Sliver.

I've taken a lot of stick, a lot of stick over the years, especially at XFM for being a fan of Counting Crows. But I'm sticking with it.

I mean I'm lucky enough to kind of call it work. I mean the Radio Studio six days a week. I'm DJing. I like to play on music production software you know. I mean it is pretty much everything in my life. It's a hobby, it's work. Having the Sonor system in the house is a revolution. I can be like in the bedroom just listening to what I want. My girlfriend's in the kitchen making some food. listening to what she wants and I can come home and say I heard this amazing track today, stream it through the Spotify and you know just blast it through the house.

E se parte da cidade do Braga, então saiba que a get-buzz trata de tudo. Um jovem licenciado em desenho do produto, cansado de nunca saber como chegar ou sair do aeroporto. Lembrou-se de criar uma ligação direta, rápida e barata, entre os dois pontos. que vinha para a Braga, sempre regressava a Braga e eu tinha sempre a dificuldade de deslocar para Braga. Com esta auto-carra é a primeira viagem que eu faço, sim. Comprei o bilhete pela internet, muito mais fácil, prático. Foi rápido, foi antes, chegar o que comprei eu. É um serviço cómodo, não é? Para os passageiros? Sim, para nós foi. É a primeira vez, foi muito cómodo. É bom porque não se achar que nem ninguém pode levar ao aeroporto, é super cómodo e apreço baixo, não é? É um custo que fica mais barato do que de carro, não é? A ideia surgiu no banco de um café em Londres mas rapidamente ganhou forma e corre agora sobre rodas. Cerca de mil passageiros em dois meses, o que é ótimo. E cerca de 40 mil quilómetros também já por correto. Também, exatamente. O aeroporto e a cidade estão agora, mais próximos, ligações. A novas cidades estão já a ser estoladas. O mercado é pidecível e a get-base não quer despedir-se a oportunidade. para pensar em todos os viajantes, a próxima ligação é partir de Guimarães.","If you think about traveling in the near future and don't know how to get to San Francisco, Sacranaro Airport and if you're from the city of Braga, then you know that the GetBus is all about. A young man who is interested in product design, tired of never knowing how to get to or leave the airport. It reminded him of creating a direct, fast and cheap connection between the two points. I always came to Braga, I always returned to Braga and I had a hard time getting to Braga. With this car, it's the first time I do it. Yes, I bought a ticket online, much easier, practical. It was fast, it was before, I got it as I bought it. It's a comfortable service, isn't it? For passengers? Yes, it was the first time, it was very comfortable. It's good because nobody even takes you to the airport, it's super comfortable and the price is high, isn't it? It's a cost that's cheaper than a car. The idea came from a coffee shop in London, but quickly it became a trend and now runs on wheels. About 1000 passengers in 2 months, which is great. And about 40,000 km is already perfect. Exactly. The airport and the city are now, closer to each other, connecting the new cities that are already being installed. The market is accessible and the get-bas doesn't want to waste opportunities. to think about all the travelers, the next call is from Guimarães."

Aquí pueden ver su rosto muy bien detallado. Sus ojos son pintados de un color amarillo muy bajo, casi blanco, igual de estas rayas y su símbolo de los cuatro fantásticos. Y está realizado o moldeado más bien en un plástico de color semi-translúcido de color orziz naranja, un poco de color amarillo, aquí lo pueden ver, también es semitranslucido y un rojo un poco más intenso para lo que sería el tronco de la figura y pueden ver en nivel de detalle los músculos están muy para la verdad, está de detalle de llama en lo que sería el aparte de su cabello sus músculos de la espalda muy bien detallados y igual, desde la pierna, aquí lo pueden ver, el pecho, un rojo muy bien exhcito todo y pues actualmente lo pueden conseguir en lo que es Wildman fue vuelto a Rey fue reeditado nuevamente la verdad no lo dejen pasar si ven a cable o a Tidecloth dejen pasar a Tidecloth y salganse de lo que es la torche humana ya que llegó a costar 500 pesos o más y ahora pasamos a las articulaciones de la figura puede subir y bajar su pie tiene flexión y extensión en la rodilla de igual forma tiene una doble articulación el cual permite flexionar aún más la rodilla puede subir y bajar su pie y también puede angular hacia los lados tiene una articulación lo que es el pecho con el tronco el cual le permite girar 360 grados su mano la puede girar también 360 grados la puede subir y bajar flexión y extensión en el codo su mano la puede girar 360 grados y por último su cara también la puede girar 360 grados y ahora pasamos a la presentación de la figura aquí lo podían ver en su parque la verdad está muy padre de la ilustración me encanta este es su ahora si su único sacador es la de esta especie de yana y su puri pai ya actualmente eso de puri pa ya no existe aquí el logo de shin ya que es de la rues número uno y por detrás de la caja podríamos ver eso la verdad si disminuiría un poco lo que es hay a ver, ya está, si se ve un poco diferente lo que es aquí el rostro detrás de la presentación miren a ver si pueden tocar, ahí se ve que sí un poco diferente y justo aquí pueden ver como siempre otros siglos que se pueden adquirir de la misma línea y pues mi Fury por detrás de la caja y pues podrán darse cuenta que yo ya cuento con tres, la verdad si soy un poco atascado y ya tengo tres figuras de la Torch Humanas pero si quieres adquirir una a un buen precio entra en mi publicación que tengo en Facebook o también me puedes buscar en lo que sería Messenger o también puedes mandar aquí un mensaje en YouTube, un mensaje privado, la verdad ahorita voy a poner a finalizar las figuras con las que cuento y tengo a venta, están muy bien estas figuras ya son un poco de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su suerte y de su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su su","What's up my dear universe fans, I'm Gundamurus and that's another quick video review and we'll see what the figure of the chorus of the human torch is. So let's start with a little bit of history about this character, his real name is Johnny Stone, he is a member of the four fantasticos, currently in the comics and his power was acquired by a cosmic storm and the rest I think you can investigate it very well in what some comics are and in other media, and then we go through what is the level of detail of the figure and his painting. Here you can see his face very well detailed, his eyes are painted in a very low yellow color, almost white, just like these rays and his symbol of the four fantastic and it is made or molded more well in a semi-translucid color, orange, a little yellowish here you can see it is also semi-translucid and a slightly more intense red for what would be the trunk of the figure and you can see in detail the muscles are very good for the truth this detail of the flame in what would be the part of his hair his muscles of the back very well detailed and the same as the legs here you can see the chest a very well-executed face everything You can get it in the Wildman version, it was rewritten again, you can buy it in the Cypher, or in the Cypher, you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you can buy it in Cypher, and you allows you to flex your knees, you can go up and down your feet and you can also angle to the sides. It has a joint which is the chest with the trunk which allows you to turn 360 degrees, your hand can also turn 360 degrees, you can go up and down, flexion and extension in the elbow, your hand can turn 360 degrees and finally your face can also turn 360 degrees. and now we go to the presentation of the figure here you could not see in his park the truth is very bad of the illustration I love this is his only contact this is the kind of yana and his purify and currently that purify no longer exists here the logo of shin since it is the number one and behind the box we could see that the truth if it would tell a little what it is there you can see a little different what is here the face behind the presentation look at the side that is a little different and just here you can see as always other figures that could be acquired from the same line and then my theory is behind the box and then you can realize that I already have three I have 3 human figures but if you want to get one at a good price visit my facebook or you can also look for me on messenger or you can also send me a private message here I will now finish the figures with the ones I have to sell and if you want to get it, the best thing is that I have them at a good price and I also want to send a greeting to my friend Big Cafe, which is practically what we should say is responsible for these insurance to be at a good price and if you have to say I am a good wall, you already know how to get the human torch and at the end I leave you the insurance that I have in sale, we say goodbye"

Rosie is a lively little talent. She is very quick. She also likes to be very busy. Any job is a good job for Rosie. One day Rosie and Emily were at Knapford Station. The Fat Controller had some important news. The Funfer Train is waiting at Brendam Docks. Rosie was excited. She hoped the fact controller would ask her to pull the Funfair train. Then Rosie had an idea. If she arrived at the docks before Emily, she could take the Funfer Special. Then Emily could puff straight to Hill Farm. That would really help Emily. So Rosie raced off as fast as her pistons would pull. Rosie puffed alongside the Funfer Special. This is a very long train. Rosie was a little bit too busy. Rosie couldn't see that Emily was already coupled up and waiting for Rosie. Rosie quickly coupled up to the Fumpur special. Emily will be pleased, she thought. Still, Rosie didn't know that Emily was on the other end of the train. Then there was trouble. Rosie huffed and puffed. She heaved and hauled. The couplings groaned and strained until one of them snagged. Hooray! I'm pulling the Fumpur. But Rosie had left half of it behind with Emily. Rosie puffed proudly along. The children were very excited to see Rosie pulling a fun-for-special. That made Rosie happy. Then there was trouble. Another coupling snapped. Up ahead, Bertie was carrying children to the fun-for. Rosie chuffed by. Bertie stopped and started to pull the fun-for-special. But Bertie was tooting because the coconut truck was rolling toward the level crossing. It smashed against the gate. Coconuts rolled everywhere. The level crossing was blocked, but Rosie didn't know. She puffed happily on. Then another coupling snapped. Rosie took a look at the top of the tree. He's whistling at my fun first special, thought Rosie proudly. But Stetney was whistling because the truck of sugar was now rolling towards him. Stetney was covered in pink sugar from funnel to foot plate. But Rosie didn't know. She was waiting for the right time to go. She heard an engine's whistle. They're whistling at my fun fair special too. Rosie thought happily. But it was Emily with the rest of the fun fair trucks. Rosie's flatbed was now rolling back towards Emily. He crashed into Emily. Seats from the big wheel clashed and clashed. All over the tracks Emily was stuck Rosie chuffed cheerfully into make-way station Nobody waved or whistled The Fat Controller was cross I told you to be Emily's back engine But I brought the fun for special all on my own sir. I wanted to help Emily You haven't helped anyone you have caused confusion and delay You've left off the train! Now there will be no fun for the children! Rosie felt terrible. She had wanted everyone to be proud of her and now they were cross. Please sir, I know just what to do. I'm a very quick engine. I can collect all the trucks. Then I'll be Emily's back engine and we will deliver the fun for special in time. So Rosie whooshed off as fast as she could. Emily's tracks were still blocked. Then Rosie collected a new truck of sugar and she raced back to Emily. Rosie had been very quick. Rocky had just loaded the seats back onto the flatbed. I'm ready to be your back engine now. And together they set off the Gordon's Hill. Rosie and Emily were on the same boat. arrived at Mayflex. All the children waved at the two and we have delivered the fun for special in time. That evening Rosie and Emily watched the children at the fun for the children were having a wonderful time. I hope we can work together on another special the sooner the better.

Do not know what's going to happen. Full of suspense. I would expect there to be some shocks, twists and turns in the plots. Your fear to be built up with music. To be encapsulated by the film, driven in, taken in by it. Not to have it to have a bit of horror element. I think the shining is one of the best thrillers that there was. Expect to be entertained. Obviously I expect it to not be predictable. Explosions, cars... What I'd expect is something that evokes a really strong sense of suspense as part of whatever story it's telling and then I think that that would lead to me calling it more of a thriller. Action, pace, love interest. Sort of horary but not horary. Like dramatic expectations. If I'm watching a thriller I expect it to be exciting that it keeps me on the edge of my seat with loads of, I particularly like it when the plot twists. Something that's just quite exciting. A male hero, a woman hanging around. A film that keeps me in suspense, that's got tension, that's got twists and turns and likely to make me jump and feel anxious but exciting as well. I was about to be thrilled, I was about to be scared. I'm a big fan of horror films and one of the things that I expect from a horror movie is for it to make me jump. But not in an obvious place. It's all about what you can't see rather than what you can. So it's much more thrilling and scarier if you can't see a thing you can perhaps hear it or sense it. That for me is really what thrill is about. Lots of fighting and weapons and rushing around in fast music. Stuff that happens that isn't the main parts like the cabrack during the film like a trimpot or something that makes a loud noise but that's not actually the thing that's the thriller. My favourite subgenre is psychological thriller. Usually a slower pace, you need to be a little bit more thoughtful and considered. They will expect a bit of intelligence from their viewers. A law will be a rule for the audience, while keeping suspense. For example, my favourite film is Shutter Island and it takes you somewhere in the end where you don't suspect. I like to be shocked by the films. posters, outside cinemas and outside bus stops and then you'd probably see loads of trailers on the internet and on YouTube and things like that. Trailers with so many explosions in them and so many crashes that you can't count them. I was doing this guy in the right kind of skin. I would probably watch a film if I'd seen posters of it, TV adverts, write-ups in magazines or also probably if I'd read the book. I'd always read the book first then watch the film second. So obviously they don't show you everything, they only show you bits and pieces so you'd obviously go and have to watch it. People doing voiceovers in very deep voices because things are so significant. Shots of women looking sexy, shots of men looking sexy. Magazine covers with stars on them and headlines like The Real James Bond or The Real MI6. By not giving the whole movie away. It's been instantly gripped by the trailer for it to have little teasers of what the film is about. Bress, what's in the book, however, sometimes you can see more in the film, which the book doesn't show. And like the fonts and pictures were relevant. And the language as well, like the language would have to be scary. By having dark and dreary colours in the poster I would give the suspense about the movie. There's advertisements and previews. Obviously the trailer's got a tease but not give away too much of the storyline but maybe a little taste of what the actual main part of it is. Stuff like that.","to be scary.

They said it was Bell's palsy. of the nerve in the cranium and it shuts down half your face.

Jim Steinmeyer's popular effect involves a hank of rope — supposedly an artifact from one of Houdini's famous escapes. ""Many people thought that he could actually dematerialize and pass through the rope. It sounds incredible, but I'd like to give you a demonstration.""  The magician stretches the rope across the stage and has it examined by two men from the audience. The spectators hold the ends of the rope as a small upright stand is rolled to the center of the rope. ""This is the spot where I'm going to try to pass through the rope."" The magician steps up onto the stand, framed by the wooden uprights. He pauses behind the taut rope, then covers the center of the rope with a square of cloth. Dramatically, he steps forward, until the audience can see that he's passed completely through Houdini's Rope!  Houdini's Rope is not only a perfect ""first illusion,"" but an entertaining, mystifying routine for experienced illusionists. Mak Magic has developed a beautiful, practical prop for magicians, finished with natural wood and mounted on casters. You'll marvel at how efficiently it works.  The stand breaks down for packing and is small enough to use on almost any platform or stage, but the effect is large enough to be seen by any audience. The effect comes with Jim Steinmeyer's presentation from his book, Device and Illusion.","Houdini's, magician, Magic, magic school, magical, magician video, magic contest, tricks, magician supplies, magic video, magic class, magic show, magicians, magic tricks, Rope",763,2,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/LeUK-HK1UwQ.mp3,"In the 1920s when Harry Houdini was in his prime, he found it very difficult to convince his audience that he was not in fact a miracle worker.

I hate to say it, but it's it sucks. I love the compact. It's cute, but it's not worth keeping for $35. So I'm actually gonna return it tonight and I have the pearl shade sticks coming soon in the mail. They didn't have it at the store, so I ordered it online and I hope those are gonna be a little bit better. But here's why I don't like it is for one, the color payoff is horrible. Everything looks kind of grayish and it's all very matte, which normally I wouldn't have a problem with, but it makes the colors look so dull. There's not enough color in the shadows to make me like it. enough I guess. First of all it falls away a lot so you see how loose that is it's actually breaking up even when you roll it. Let's pull this off. Even when you roll it you see the powder starting to break up already I'm just rolling it. When you put it on looks nothing like what you would expect it to look like. It's a little purple yeah but It's not as purple as it is in the compact and you can see it's kind of got a gray hue to it and it's very dull and it's nothing special. It's not exciting and it's not worth the $35. This entire compact is even, let's see, the black. It just falls so much and it's not very dark. The lipglosses on the bottom might as well be all the same damn. color because that's what it comes off as. Here's the white using a different finger. Here's the mauve. Here's the pink. And here's the purple. Invisible glasses. I mean you could go to the flea market and get one of those cherry rollerball glasses that I love so much and they smell like cherry for a dollar and it's better than these. So not worth it. I mean it's really super cute. I don't know if you can tell in the video but the compact is actually pearlescent it's not just a white plastic and I mean if these could pop out easily I probably would keep the compact and make my own lip gloss and press it in there or mix my own Mac pigments and press it in there you know but you can't really it would be messy and it's just not worth the trouble so I'm gonna return this tonight let me do some quick swatches of the shadows on my other hand so even when I'm using my finger which is going to give me the most coverage. The color is still really bad. Here's the light purple that looks ashy and white. Here's the gray and they all have a shimmer in them. When you look at it in a compact, well except for the purple, but they're just all the same. Flat color grayish tone. It looks nothing like the ad. You see the on Sephora girl with the purple compact on this one looks nothing like that. They probably use some other primers and it doesn't say on the back who actually makes the makeup. So I assume that it's Sephora makeup. You know Sephora has their own line of cosmetics so I think it's just pretty much Sephora cosmetics and they got the licensing for Hello Kitty packaging and they put their stuff in Hello Kitty packaging. So I know you might like it. It's cute for a little girl if you want to spend $35 on makeup for a little girl, but It's not for true makeup lovers because the quality is just really bad I do like the perfume though. I love the perfume it smells so good. So if you get a chance Get the Hello Kitty perfume because it's it's sweet and it's fresh and it's lovely. Okay, thanks.

É a esse sentido que nos referimos quando dizemos que algo está na moda ou fora de moda. Houve um tempo em que calças boca de sino e santropê Ou camisas floridas eram fashion. Fashion. Outra palavra que pode ser cheia de significado. Ou espetacularmente vazia de acordo sobre que ponto de vista observamos. Vejamos essas fotos. Elas foram tiradas no mais recente desfile da Casa dos Criadores. Um evento onde jovens estilistas lançam suas coleções ao público. Criações um tanto exóticas. Ou usadas. artísticas, certamente de algum valor estético. Mas você sairia as ruas vestindo peças consenuais antenadas com o que há de mais novo nesse mundo de passarelas? Não. E nem é essa a intenção deles. Na verdade, a nossa intenção a mostrar essas imagens é outra. Nós queremos perguntar a ti, espectador, até que ponto você se sente influenciado pelas marcas, estilos, e mensagens que uma vestimenta careta. Nós vivemos numa sociedade pós-moderna. As roupas nos dizem o que somos e o que queremos dizer. Não apenas as roupas, mas todo o nosso conjunto de acessórios e traquitanas que nos acompanham. Mesmo os acessórios que crescem naturalmente em nós mesmos e que escolhemos manter. Grandes ou pequenos, ou mesmo bastante diferentes do padrão, eles expressam muito bem o que que queremos passar? Ou então até a maneira pela qual você cobra esses mesmos cabelos? Ou se você não tiver nenhum cabelo? Não é nada pessoal, viu, professor? Às vezes um artigo aparentemente secundário, como uma pasta, expresso uma mensagem que diz muito sobre a pessoa e seu interesse ativista em determinada causa, além da menina em questão ser muito estilosa. É muito comum também que as pessoas se vistam de uma determinada forma, a fim de representar um grupo específico de pessoas, como corintianos, pessoas que vão ao Juca, fãs de uma determinada banda ou mesmo pessoas que ficam se achando por andar por aí com camisas de times estrangeiros. É também sintoma dos nossos tempos pós-modernos quando uma marco ocupa um espaço tão grande de uma peça de roupa se tornando ela mesma a acessória uma pessoa. Ou mesmo quando três listras já são o bastante para e o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o que é o cada um apresenta diferenças, nem mesmo gêmeos se vestem igualmente o tempo todo. Então, com o que nos devemos preocupar quando escolhemos o que vestir? Parece até um clichê, mas conceitos como conforto, identidade e bem-estar devem ser valorizados sob qualquer hipótese. A conjunção desses fatores termina em felicidade. Seja feliz.","One of the fashion definitions according to Aurelio is use, habit or style generally accepted, variable time and resultant of a certain taste, social medium, region and etc. And it can also be use the passenger who regulates the way of wearing. It is in this sense that we refer to when we say that something is in fashion or out of fashion. There was a time when pants, pants and pants or floral shirts were fashion. Fashion. Another word that can be full of meaning. Or spectacularly empty of agreement about what point of view we observe. Let's see these photos. They were taken in the latest show of the creator's house. An event where young stylists launch their collections to the public. Creations somewhat exotic. Or used. Artistic. Certainly of some aesthetic value. But would you go out on the streets wearing consensual pieces, antennaed with what is the newest in this world of pastures? No. And it's not even their intention. Actually, our intention to show these images is another. We want to ask you, viewer, to what extent do you feel influenced by brands, styles, and messages that a correct dress. We live in a postmodern society. Clothes tell us what we are and what we want to say. Not only clothes, but all of us in the set of accessories and traquitans that follow us. Even the accessories that naturally grow in ourselves and that we choose to keep. Big or small, or even quite different from the standard, they express very well what they want. or even the way you cover your own hair. Or if you don't have any hair. It's nothing personal, right professor? Sometimes a article apparently, apparently secondary, like a folder, expresses a message that says a lot about the person and their interest in a particular cause, besides the boy in question, being very stylish. It's common for people to see themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent themselves in a particular way, in order to represent a specific group of people, like Corinthians, people who go to Juca, fans of a certain band, or even people who think they can walk around with shirts from foreign teams. It is also a symptom of our postmodern times when a brand occupies such a large space of a piece of clothing, becoming the same to access a person. Or even when three lists are enough to The simple addition of a helmet represents a disfigured message whose decoding depends on the receiver. There are so many signs, so many messages, so many codes being issued from the simple act of dressing up. Even when someone dresses up, pretentiously, it can motivate interpretations. The style of the costume is very important. Each one presents differences. Not even the twins dress equally all the time. So what should we worry about when we choose what to wear? It looks like a cliché, but concepts such as comfort, identity and well-being must be valued under any hypothesis. The conjunction of these factors ends in happiness. Be happy."

I would also like to congratulate Konami, who brought this game in Portuguese for us here. And I also asked for something. The six of my channel that follows me on the channel there. People from CJABR also. Before we release this video, why? We want this collection of collections here in Brazil, because this one doesn't exist in Brazil. It only comes out in the United States. So it was only a preference for people from there. I know that people are investing here now, but trust us. and let's make this video to the Konami and show what we want So let's go guys, let's go to what interests us It was opened by the fan, let me show you here It's open by the Brazilian flag They opened it to know what it was So this game costs at the state of 150 dollars, with a fee of about 450 reais But the same way, it's worth it Let's see what's inside I even play with the Riding before Metal Gear 2, I called Adriana Galisteu, who looked a lot like her. Let's go to the other side of the box. Very cool, I'm very happy. Thanks to each of you who invested here. Thank you again, let's go. Here, here and here. I know she does this. Here it comes. Let's take this part here. Now the game is coming, I'll put it here for you to see. The game is coming and the stylebook is coming. I found this very cool. The game everyone already knows, there are several unboxings there, but we will show you too. And the stylebook is coming. Look how cool this stylebook is. Very detailed, look how cool. A very cool air. Let's open it here. Look at the background. It's what's coming in Brazil, right? Two for two steps, right? Which is the host, you saw the sound and the game, right? Let's open it here to see the game, that everyone knows, right? The Lord Game, who hasn't got it yet, I ask to get it because it's an excellent game. Let's see inside, but there's no DLC. There must be a little DLC, what is this one? So, a little screen, but the manual, the manual, you already know, right? I want to show you the other part. The sound, track and game. Let's go to the interest here. What comes from special here. Even a manual. It's a plasma lamp. I'll give you a chance to see what it is. Very cool this lamp. Some reasons that encouraged me to buy. There's a manual. Then a calm read. Let's see here. Look at this box, it's very well made. The things I gave him with my hand, he really cares. So, Konami, we want this sold in Brazil. Invest in us, I'm sure you won't regret it. Look how cool it is. It's really well made, it's a lamp, I'll open it from the bottom. This is a light, here we have the RIDE SPADA. So when you put it on the socket, there is a different reaction. I'll do the test now, I'll put it on the socket quickly so you can check it out. Look at the details here, the Metal Gear Rising. Very cool, let's open it here, here is a normal socket. Let's put it on the socket, let's see the back part too. 1 and 2 buttons, nothing too much. What's worth here is the following. Let's go to the source, show. This one box here, whoever is going to do it, I bought this item and recommend you to do it at night, because we are doing it now. It's worth a lot. Let's show you how it looks here with the light. Look how cool, guys. Look, this is to put your finger, look. Very cool. So, apparently this is the other mode. The Bajur mode. I'll say goodbye to you, you help me to share this video, and the show now in the dark, very cool, that's it guys, give it a like, share with people, it's worth it, so until I post a unboxing, I'm leaving"

La problématique qui était celle du cinéma, c'est que c'est un cinéma qui est dans un centre commercial qui est assez éloigné finalement des zones résidentielles. Le cinéma est dans le centre commercial Gaumont-Carré-Sénard et c'est un centre qui est très fréquenté en journée, et moins fréquenté en soirée. Donc la problématique du cinéma c'est de relier ces événements à des gens qui habitent à porter de voitures, c'est-à-dire à moins de 10 minutes, un quart d'heure en voiture du lieu. Pour eux évidemment la publicité n'a n'intérêt que si elle est locale. Ils ont envie de toucher des gens qui habitent à Rys Orangis, qui habitent à Melin, Sénar, qui habitent à Evry parce que finalement c'est les gens qui viennent dans leur au cinéma, ils ont constaté que c'est les gens qui étaient habités dans ces villes. Alors, on a mis en place une opération pour eux en utilisant notre réseau de sites à d'applications mobiles géosiblées. Donc, le fonctionnement est le suivant. On travaillait avec le parisien 20 minutes, la chaîne météo. Tous les gens qui consultaient ces applications-là dans la période de la campagne, c'est-à-dire grosso modo entre le 1er décembre et le 11 décembre, quand ils se connectaient sur cette application, ils avaient en priorité des publicités qui annonçaient cet événement. Alors il n'y avait pas que ça, il y avait une rotation entre plusieurs publicités évidemment, parce qu'on évite l'effet de saturation, mais en tout cas cette campagne a été diffusée en priorité avec une part de voix qui devait être de l'ordre de 30-35% sur l'ensemble des pages vues des gens qui étaient dans cette zone. J'insiste les gens qui habitaient à Versailles, qui habitaient à Saint-Ouen, n'ont jamais vu cette campagne. Donc ça c'est le premier dispositif. de façon locale sur un événement. Alors là vous me direz super, mais finalement, qu'est-ce que ça apporte en plus par rapport à une campagne d'affichage ou à une campagne à la radio sur le décrochage Val de Marne d'une radio connue. Ce que ça apporte en plus, finalement, c'est ce qui peut se passer derrière. C'est-à-dire que non seulement on va cibler des personnes qui habitent dans la bonne zone géographique qui nous intéresse, et derrière on va être capable de leur laisser sur leur téléphone, c'est-à-dire sur un un objet très personnel qu'ils ont avec toute la journée, une trace de cet événement. Et cette trace, c'est une sorte de, on appelle ça un passe, c'est-à-dire une petite fiche qui décrit l'événement, où est-ce que ça se passe, à quel endroit, quel jour, quel film, qui vont sauvegarder dans leur téléphone. Alors, pour ceux qui veulent le savoir, ça s'appelle un passe, et c'est disponible sur Apple, sur les iPhone, donc c'est un passebook. L'avantage, c'est qu'à chaque fois qu'on a un passe, que les personnes vont se rapprocher du centre commercial, il y a un petit message, ce qu'on appelle une notification qui va apparaître sur l'écran de leur téléphone, pour leur dire « n'oubliez pas, le mardi, on se désembre à 23h avant première du film ». Donc, on a ciblé les gens à qui on s'est adressés. Ceux qui étaient intéressés, qui ont cliqué sur la bannière de la campagne, ont sauvegardé sur leur téléphone un passe et ce passe ensuite est devenu active dans le sens où à chaque fois qu'ils sont rapprochés du centre commercial, se passent et réveillent pour leur rappeler l'événement. Donc c'est une campagne en deux temps du geociblage et ensuite du passbook qui permet de démultiplier l'effet de la campagne. C'était une campagne locale donc ce n'est pas non plus le volume d'une campagne nationale mais grosso modo si je ne dis pas de bêtises on a dû diffuser à peu près 500 000 bannières dans les 10 jours de la campagne. On a dû avoir à peu près 1400 500 clics sur les bannières. Alors certains Certains de ces clics étaient des clics qui étaient faits sur des téléphones Android qui n'étaient pas compatibles avec le pass, donc dans ces cas là on les envisage sur une page très particulière. Et on a fait télécharger à peu près 200 passbooks par des clients. Alors ce qui est intéressant aussi, c'est que ces passbooks, une fois qu'ils sont installés dans le téléphone des clients, ils y restent. C'est-à-dire qu'il y a un taux de désinstallation qui est très faible et finalement ce passbook va servir au cours de l'année 2013 au cinéma pour relayer d'autres événements. Alors évidemment, l'objectif c'est pas d'en rester là, et de continuer finalement le recrutement de clients qui sont porteurs de ce pass du Gomu Kare Sena, l'idée est tant de constituer petit à petit une communauté, en tout cas une base de clients qui ont ce pass dans leur téléphone et à qui on va pouvoir établir tout au long de l'année une communication, enfin un dialogue sur les événements organisés par le SEMA.","I'll talk about an operation that was made with the GoMunkare Senar cinema in December 2012, at the occasion of the first love affair for the film The Hobbit by Peter Jackson. The problem with the cinema is that it's a commercial centre that is far from residential areas. The cinema is in the GoMunkare Senar commercial centre and it's a very common centre during the day The problem with cinema is to link these events to people who live in cars, that is to say, at least 10 minutes, 1.5 hours in a car. For them, obviously, the advertising is of no interest, because if it is local, they want to touch people who live in rice orangis, who live in Melin, Senar, who live in Every, because ultimately, it is the people who come to their house, they noticed that these people lived in these cities. We set up an operation for them using our network of mobile application sites GeoChibly. The following operation was done with the Parisian, 20 minutes, the chain Meteo. All the people who consulted these applications during the campaign, roughly between December 1 and December 11, when they connected on this application, They had a priority of advertising that announced this event. So there was not only that, there was a rotation between several ads obviously, because we avoid the saturation effect, but in any case, this campaign was broadcast in priority with a part of voice that was going to be 30-35% on the whole of the pages seen by people who were in this zone. I insist, people who lived in Versailles, who lived in Saint-Touan have never seen this campaign. So that's the first device. So, you might ask me what does it bring to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, to the radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, A very personal object that they have all day A trace of this event And this trace is a sort of a... we call it a pass A little file that describes the event, where it happens, at what place, what day, what movie they will save in their phone So for those who want to know, it's called a pass It's available on Apple, on the iPhone, so it's a passbook Every time people come closer to the mall, there is a message on the phone screen to tell them to not forget, on the 23rd of December, before the first film. We targeted people who were interested, who clicked on the bell of the campaign, we looked at their phone, a pass, and then it became Active in the sense that every time they are approached from the commercial center, they are awakened to remind them of the event. So it's a campaign in two times, geoscibility and then the passbook which allows to multiply the effect of the campaign. It was a local campaign, so it's not the volume of a national campaign either. But roughly speaking, if I'm not mistaken, we have used to broadcast about 500,000 showers in the 10 days of the campaign. We must have about 1400, 1500 clicks on the showers. Some of these clicks were made on Android phones that were not compatible with the PAS, so in these cases we want to make them on a very particular page. And we downloaded about 200 PAS books by customers. So what is interesting too is that these PAS books, once they are installed in the customer's phone, they stay. That is to say that there is a very weak installation rate and finally this PAS book will be used in the course of the NNM 2013 to relay other events. So obviously the goal is not to stay there, and to continue the recruitment of customers who are carriers of this pass of the Gomu Kare Sena. The idea is to try to create a community, at least a base of customers who have this pass in their phones and to whom we will be able to establish, throughout the year, a communication, a dialogue on events organized by the SEMA."

Yeah. Welcome back to our segments on education here with health and performance center. What we're going to talk about today is low back pain and specifically disc herniations. A lot of patients will come into me or people that I talked to just in general conversation, ask me if I even treat disc herniations. We say absolutely yes we do. We not only take care of the problem after their herniation, but the more important part is that we try and prevent them from ever happening. understanding good technique. Again we look up here and we see move well then fast or just period just move well and you really take care a lot of your issues. Now specifically we look at disc herniations and when do they happen? Well you've heard kind of probably from your friends or people you know going down to pick up a you know a toothbrush or something a t-shirt off of the ground in the morning and all of a sudden just picking up something that doesn't weigh at all all of a sudden they hear a pop and their back is out and they're out of commission. So most of the time that's happening from positioning right here. We have two or three. These are both bad compensation strategies for picking something up off the ground. What we want to see is a much more stable and neutral spine when we do that so that everything in these discs really kind of stay where they're supposed to. If you look at the difference between this nice neutral posture of the spine and this big, big curve here, all we have have to understand is that the disc herniations usually happen out the back part of the spine. So when we bend over, Jim, if you kind of move over and watch this, if I'm bending over like so, I'm putting a massive amount of pressure on my lumbar discs. If I pick up anything of weight, I'm very vulnerable to a herniation or disc damage. Now if I just stabilize my posture and move more through my hip instead of my low back, I can get down to whatever I'm picking up in a very stable and neutral position. And you see that the position of my back from this position here to the bottom position is very similar. In fact, it should be identical. All of the movement happens through this hip joint right here to pick something up. Now, many patients on a chair do really, do you really pick everything up like that? Well, no, not everything. But if I'm going to pick this up. I'm certainly not going to pull something like this that really stresses my low back. What I'm going to do is probably go down just like so, pick it up. Again, in fast motion, we'll watch it. I'm right here and you see that, man, it didn't take me to, oh gosh, I got to do this, this, that, the other thing. It's very simple. Once you learn the mechanic and reinforce it, you really decrease the likelihood of ever being in this position or this position. which is lumbar flexion and it's pretty much the recipe for disc herniation and all of that. If I stay neutral with my spine, I'm really safe and the kicker is every time that I pick something up, I'm doing a rehab exercise that makes me stronger instead of something that drives me closer to injury. Try to incorporate that into your day. If you have that low back pain or if you have disc issues, it should help a lot. If not, you might need a little bit of help and that's where we come in. Regardless, we hope you're doing this helps and we hope to help you in the future.","I get a good feeling. Yeah. Welcome back to our segments on education here with health and performance center.

First of all, you want to log on to blackboard and then go to your courses, select the visc105 course for this class and then you'll come to your announcements page first like this and then over here on the green bars you'll see the visc105 course wiki. the wiki from there. There's also other ways to get to it, but once you get into the wiki's page, select this particular visee 105 video and sound wiki. Then you have the home page here, and you'll see on the home page there are various categories to choose from. So pick one of these categories, find something interesting from the web, either a web page or a YouTube video, and make sure it falls into one of these categories. Once you do that, find it in another tab on your browser. Come back to this page. Let's just add a video. You can either click on one of these categories or just start right here where it says create wiki page. This is going to create a new page. What I recommend doing is I've found a YouTube video over here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here Just copy and paste this title of this video here which is how to compress video for your YouTube in H264 so copying that I'm going to go back to blackboard so I'm going to paste that name right here so that'll have a nice name for it. I'm going to give a couple blank lines here. You can type a description here if you want. You don't have to Right here is the way to get this video embedded into this page. It's called add a mashup. So what you're going to do is click this button here that says add mashup. So there we go. Then it gives you a drop down menu. You can add photos, some other different things here. But we want the YouTube video. So click on YouTube video. That brings up this dialog box. Again, since I've already copied the name, I'm just going to paste that name right into here. And I'm going to select exact phrase so for some reason all the words don't bring up the correct search so Paste the name of the video the exact name of the video go to exact phrase and you want to hit go to search So now it's going to search for YouTube videos and you might have several choices depending on what you you pick so What you want to do is you can put preview you can make sure this is the right video that I wanted People's Browsers and Blackboard doesn't let you display it. So you want that link so you can go directly to YouTube and watch the video. And you also want to show the YouTube information that lets viewers know a little bit more about the video content. So once you've got those buttons selected, then you just need to hit submit. And once you submit that, it'll be embedded into here. You can also make sure that you come up here then. and submit your video to get credit for it. There's also the submit button at the bottom. There's no other options. You can type other text in if you want. But one item per page for grading purposes to get your extra credit and hit submit. So this will hopefully show up. There's your page that you just created. So you can actually play your video to make sure it plays. This is the page you can use to create a page. Copy that, paste that into here, and then add by lol. Create a URL link. Click on the link and once you get that going in the hyperlink there, make sure that's HTTP. Then you want to overwrite this, so make sure this is selected or deleted before you paste your new link in because it adds that HTTP and it's kind of unnecessary, but it is there and you got to get rid of it before you can actually paste. I like to open the link in a new window just in case Blackboard has trouble with it. So once you've got that you can hit submit and then you should have a valid hyperlink. And you can right click on it and open link in new tab. You should see your link come up in a new tab here so you can go to it and there it is. So now you know your link is working. Once you've got that done you can spruce it up a little bit however you want to. I'm going to add a little credit them with that. So there you go, that's the link. So that'll work. Just keep plugging away, go back to the home page over here, search YouTube and find some more ideas for these categories here and get some extra credit.","OK everyone, this is the how to add a page to the wiki so I can get extra credit tutorial.

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here Just copy and paste this title of this video here which is how to compress video for your YouTube in H.264 so copying that I'm going to go back to blackboard so I'm going to paste that name right here so that'll have a nice name for it I'm going to give a couple blank lines here you can type a description here if you want you don't have to Right here is the way to get this video embedded into this page. It's called add a mashup. So what you're going to do is click this button here that says add mashup. So there we go. Then it gives you a drop down menu. You can add photos, some other different things here. But we want the YouTube video. So click on YouTube video. That brings up this dialog box. Again, since I've already copied the name, I'm just going to paste that name right into here. And I'm going to select exact phrase so for some reason all the words don't bring up the correct search so Paste the name of the video the exact name of the video go to exact phrase and then you want to hit go to search So now it's going to search for YouTube videos and you might have several choices depending on what you you pick so What you want to do is you can put preview you can make sure this is the right video that I wanted People's Browsers and Blackboard doesn't let you display it. So you want that link so you can go directly to YouTube and watch the video. And you also want to show the YouTube information that lets viewers know a little bit more about the video content. So once you've got those buttons selected, then you just need to hit submit. And once you submit that, it'll be embedded into here. You can also make sure that you come up here then. and submit your video to get credit for it. There's also the submit button at the bottom. There's no other options. You can type other text in if you want. But one item per page for grading purposes to get your extra credit and hit submit. So this will hopefully show up. There's your page that you just created. So you can actually play your video to make sure it plays. This is the page you want to go back to. Copy that, paste that into here, and add by lol. Click on the link and once you get that going in the hyperlink there make sure that's HTTP then you want to overwrite this so make sure this is selected or deleted before you paste your new link in because it adds that HTTP and it's kind of unnecessary but it is there and you got to get rid of it before you can actually paste and I like to open the link in a new window just in case Blackboard has trouble with it So once you've got that you can hit submit and then you should have a valid hyperlink and you can right click on it and open link in new tab. You should see your link come up in a new tab here so you can go to it and there it is. So now you know your link is working. Once you've got that done you can spruce it up a little bit however you want to. credit them with that. So there you go, that's the link. So that'll work. Just keep plugging away, go back to the home page over here, search YouTube and find some more ideas for these categories here and get some extra credit."

Die neue Schlagerrevue im FRITZ verspricht witzige Dialoge, tolle Stimmen und natürlich viel Schlagermusik. Lassen Sie sich musikalisch zurückversetzen in die Zeit der wilden Sechziger und der bunten Siebziger Jahre und freuen Sie sich auf Hits, die Sie schon lange mal wieder hören wollten: Downtown, Schön ist es auf der Welt zu sein, Schöner fremder Mann, A Banda, Fiesta Mexicana und vielen weiteren Evergreens...

Chaque BN de sangles bénéficie d'une tolérance de 20 mm. Elles sont utilisables sur tous les types de canalisation de diamètres nominales de 60 à 300 mm. La machine est extrêmement compacte et est très utile. et nous l'utiliserons aussi bien pour les petits percements que ceux à brides. Elle est équipée d'un robinet pour l'évacuation des copots pendant le percement. Nous sommes prêts pour effectuer notre dérivation. Choisissez la sangle en fonction de votre diamètre extérieur de canalisation, quelques soixante types, et visser votre boulonnerie comme ceci. Puis postformez votre sangle autour de votre canalisation. Vous choisirez la salle en fonction des haines de dérivation, vous indique l'endroit où nous introduirons notre spatule pour l'opturation temporaire. Vérifiez qu'il n'y aura pas de gêne et si possible faites-le par le haut. Notez que la dévrivation peut se faire par le dessus, latéralement ou incliné. Nous serrons l'ensemble sur le tuyau en équilibrant le serrage. Dévisser le raccord poli vous remarquerez que le raccord à crampage est équipé de trois joints. Tout monobloc pour éviter leurs pertes Sur le chantier, choisissez l'adaptateur et la fraise adaptée à la nature du cuillot à percer et au diamètre de dérivation. Pour les PVC, les polyethylène et pour les fonds, fixez la fraise sur la machine et puis sur notre salle munie de son adaptateur, montez le tuyau d'évacuation et ouvrez le robinet. Dissez l'avance jusqu'à la conduite. Commencez le carcement en vous servant du cliquet. Avancez lentement pour ne pas Vous pouvez vérifier l'évacuation des copots. Le percement est terminé. Vous pouvez dévisser votre machine jusqu'au repère qui vous prévient du déblocage. Démontez le duo d'évacuation puis introduissez votre spatule avec un peu de graisse. La partie gravée du manche vers le haut comme ceci. Votre branchement est obturé. Vous pouvez démonter votre perceuse en toute sécurité.

Vous pouvez retirer votre spatule et recérer votre raccord. Vous êtes étanche et pour des années. Voyons la dérivation à bride. Vous avez le choix entre trois types de DNA. Le 60, le 80 et le 100 mm. Chaque DNA est pourvu de deux types de joints selon le diamètre de la canalisation à percer. Pour la salle en 60, un modèle avec joints pour les canalisations de 100 à 200 mm et un autre pour les canalisations de 200 à 300 mm.","The important tips linked to the pause and maintenance of key mouths as well as the risk of leaks on the loading handles, we invite you to present our innovative concept of percement without rubber. First of all, let's see the range of products used for our small derivatives. We will use either the Golf steel equipped with a gas padlock or the Sedek steel for the polyethylene of 25, 32, 40 and 50 mm. The link with our machine is in the description. The first for the CEDEC 25 and 32, the second for the CEDEC 40 and 5 years. The straps are delivered in a operating mode and a stainless steel bolt. Each strap BN benefits a tolerance of 20 mm. They are usable on all types of channeling, from 60 to 300 mm nominal diameter. The machine is extremely compact and has a very good quality. and we will use it as well for small pierces that are damaged. It is equipped with a rubber band for the evacuation of the coco during the piercement. We are ready to make our derivation. Choose the sand, depending on your diameter of the channeling, some 60 and screw your boulonary like this. Then, form your sand around your channeling. You will choose the one depending on the end of the derivation. We will introduce our spatula for temporary optimization. Check that there will be no gene and if possible, do it by the top. Note that the derivation can be done by the top, laterally or infinitely. We will tighten the whole on the pipe, in balance the serration. Unscrew the poly-shape, you will notice that the tie-up is equipped with three joints. All monoblocks to avoid their loss of the glue. On the field, choose the adapter and the milling mill to fit the pipe's shape and the diameter of the drill for PVC, polyethylene and for the bottom. Fix the milling mill on the machine, then on our unit of the milling mill, raise the vacuum pipe and open the grinder. You can check the evaporation of the shells. The perforation is done. You can unscrew your machine until you see that you are ready to unlock it. Unscrew the evaporation pipe, then insert your spatula with a little grease. The scraped part of the sleeve goes up like this. Your clamp is secured. You can unscrew your perforation in any security. To recover the perforation paste, use the handle of your machine. screw your poly-stitching and present your pipe mark the depth a little grease will facilitate the assembly, plug and close your counter watch or your scooter will be deported on the sidewalk you can remove your spatula and receive your agreement you are waterproof and for years let's see the abridged derivation you have the choice between three types of DNA the 60, the 80 and the 100 mm Each DNA is for two types of joints according to the diameter of the channeling per se. For the room in 60, a model with joints for channeling 100 to 200 mm and another for channeling 200 to 300 mm."

Thank you!","YouTube editor chocolate, carmel, cupcakes, baking, pecan, buddies, cooking",203,1,2,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/SHNC-bDfRuM.mp3,"So we finished the ganache and we melted it back on the stove for about maybe three minutes and we put it back in this bowl. So and it looks creamy. It's hard to like consistency. Here you can see. So now just like we have the caramel just leave it there to cool for a little bit. Yeah, and actually we put it in the fridge for a couple minutes. It just thickens it up just a tad bit enough that it stays on the cupcakes much better. So maybe put it in the fridge for like five minutes and the cupcakes are done so I'm going to take those out. So as you can see these cupcakes are huge. They're connected. We need to cut these with a knife with a blank us. piping tip you have for cakes or whatever. And just cut a hole in the corner of a plastic baggie and then stick the piping tip in the hole and then you kind of need a friend to help you with this part. So Georgia come over here. Okay. So now that caramel mixture that we made earlier, we're going to pour this into the bag. The way to stop it from getting into the piping tip and coming out before you stick it inside the cupcakes, twist it. We found that out by experience. So now just scrape All of your caramel to the bottom of the pot and pour it all in back. Try not to hit your friend in the hand with the pot because it's very hot. It's a hot pot. Actually you have a little bag problem. Make sure that you get all that caramel in there. You're going to check these things real good. Yep. It tastes better when there's more filter. It's slipping, it's slipping, it's slipping. More is better. Okay. Okay, so that's kind of tricky but you'll get to hang on that after a while. So it kinda is pretty filler. I just went on, twist this, wash it first, it's easier to stick it in. And then you kinda just jam it in the center and you have to move fast from cupcake to cupcake. Now you squeeze it, and it's okay to do this while the cupcakes are still hot because that's what makes it infused with caramel. And then you just quickly transfer it from cupcake to cupcake. The bag popped. Okay. Just keep going. These are definitely homemade. Okay, this is really hot, it's burning my fingers. And then you just keep doing this for all the rest. So now we've done the caramel, that was the hardest part. So they have like a little caramel-y center, you can see. So that was the hardest part of the whole thing. So just now we're gonna do the ganache. We took it out of the fridge and it's a lot thicker. You can just stir it with a spoon. It's perfect consistency and it tastes so good. So now what we do is take the cupcake upside down. And then if it didn't all get all in the hole to see how there's a little bit of a hole in kind of a little dip Just take a spoon and fill it up. Yeah, you just put a little dab inside the middle and it'll be thick enough that it'll fill up the hole. Let's so you can see Dip now wherever there's a little bit of cake shelling or a hole or just put it on make it nice and smooth and it should be thick enough that it just stays right on the top so and then if you let it sit out it will kind of form like a shell it doesn't harden So it's not like hard chocolate shell, but it gets hard firm enough that it stays on top. These are perfectly ganache cupcakes. We just dipped them and filled in the holes and they look awesome. So now we are going to make the caramelized pecans and they're really awesome. Come on, Georgia. I'm going to start. So I know you can't see our faces, but I'm just trying to make sure that you can see the stuff that we're making. Okay, so now we're going to start with the chopped pecans. you want about this is about like three fours of the bag is already used some to make those so just as much as you want. Yeah as much as you think you're going to need for your cupcakes. All of this is a two taste kind of thing. So with that we are going to burn this skillet on a medium heat and you just put the pecans in there and then you need like a wooden spoon to mix this or an egg spoon. And then you want to make sure these pecans get coated all in the butter. So if you need more butter or less butter, do it. Whatever you need so that the butter gets started putting in some sugar. Now the sugar, it depends on how sweet you want it, but probably about two tablespoons is a good idea. And you want to make sure it's brown sugar. Oh yeah, I forgot about you. Brown sugar. That's the way I'm browning. Sorry we're new at this. It's like we need a little bit more later than we can add a little bit more. We just want to keep stirring this until all the butter is melted and it's kind of simmering and the sugar is mixing with it and it's caramelized as the pecans. So just make sure it gets all melted. It just makes the pecans sweet and gives them a nice flavor. So you just want to keep doing this until all the sugar and the butter are mixed well and all the pecans are coated nicely. We cover them in pecans. Yes, and they look so amazing and they feel so good. I know. When we turn this video off, they will probably be gone. They will be right there. Yeah. Right here. So we hope that you guys enjoyed our first video. We're like so excited about this. It's awesome. I know. Can't wait to put it on YouTube. We hope that you feel our baking passion. Yes.

I kind of lied. They're connected. We need to cut these with a knife with a blank us. What we're going to do is take them out, let them cool, and we're going to shave them off.

I promise that the character and my mother who plays this mercy will be safe in Anju's hands. I hope mercy will be with you all. With the hope of getting along with your love and affection. Your own Beene Anthony. You didn't understand, right? This is the Jimmichan from Teikunthottam. The son of Paileepapan from Teikontham. I didn't understand after seeing him. I saw him in one or two. Here, tea. We were talking about Jancy. He is the first man to leave the country with Jancy. Jimmichan, Jancy and Joji have asked us to get married. We have heard that they have studied for 18 years. That is for his good. Is that for his good? They have driven their car in the night and have been beaten up. Have tea. Jancy was a little surprised. That was not Jimmy Chen. I don't know.

I've known Dan for a very long time. We first met when he wanted to come and work at the Community Development Corporation at Chase Manhattan Bank. The reason Dan came is because of the work that we were doing and have continued to do in community development and helping to fund affordable housing projects throughout the city. For years Dan has been the community link to a number of major business and bank and corporations, particularly Chase and Goldman Sachs. And in that capacity, he has steered money to very effective community organizations, both us directly and also to the community partners that we serve. Dan has always been involved in lots of different boards and one that's particularly interested in him has been the low-income investment fund, which is headquartered actually in California but has a unit here in New York City. and has been very active in that for years. I assume because he's interested in community development, but maybe because he likes to travel to San Francisco for a fact attack. The Center for New York City Neighborhoods is just another one of the examples where Dan's both interested in the policy and the big issues, but also how do you make a difference on the ground? And the Center for New York City Neighborhoods really out there trying to help people who have been hurt by the housing crisis, who are in danger of being foreclosed on, help them either keep their home or figure out how they can make a successful transition to a better life. It's not just his commitment to community development, but his commitment to making it work and demonstrating that it makes good business sense. To show that banks can invest in these communities, you can do that successfully, and that people, businesses, and affordable housing projects, and community development, economic development projects can be successful. So Dan, both as a worker for these major financial institutions, like Chase or like Goldman Sachs, but also personally has really invested a tremendous amount of energy and time and spirit in supporting community-based development and community organizations that do it. Dan's Vomited Book on A is just an obvious use of the skills and an obvious example of the kind of work he likes to be involved in. Dan is a wonderful guy and it's not a universal quality of people that are significant players and we're very proud of the fact that we're able to honor Dan Every year we always ponder how we're going to do it again and get such wonderful people for these particular honorary positions and then Dan certainly fits them all and is really just a great person as well as a devoted activist in this area. Supporting an organization like this fits in completely with Dan's commitment to community development.

We see them everywhere, but often take for granted the big part they play in our everyday lives. Their job is to transform the high voltage from electrical power lines to the lower voltage that's suitable for home use. Without them, raw electrical power would be virtually useless to the average person. Transformers are a critical part of modern life. But did you ever stop to wonder what's inside those canisters? To build a transformer, workers start by taking paper that's coated with with epoxy glue and tape it to a wooden block. Next component, an eighth of an inch thick aluminum strip. It's a metal that can withstand the heat that a high voltage current produces. As the block is rotated, the paper and the aluminum strip are wrapped around it. An aluminum bus bar called the low voltage lead sends low voltage current out from the transformer. Workers fold the lead and move the unit to another rotating block for more wrapping. The insulating paper has a epoxy glue on both sides. This glue will later melt and bond several components in place. On the next block, a worker tapes on more epoxy paper along with a epoxy coated copper wire. He covers the paper, then repeats the same process forming a second layer of copper wire. He solders a high voltage lead wire to the copper wire, then rolls yet another layer of copper wire. Next, he welds on what's called the lead wire out, the wire that'll protrude the transformer's cylinder and attaches vinyl coated wires that will connect to different voltages out of the transformer. This completed unit is called the coil. Now, using electrical steel, workers build the transformer's other main component called the core. The coil and core are tightly secured together with metal strapping, which will help to fix the assembly in the tank. Then it's into an oven where they bake for 8 hours at 275 degrees. It also melts the epoxy glue, fusing together the paper, the aluminum strip, and the copper wires. The assembly now goes into a steel tank. A rubber gasket is hammered around the perimeter, and a grounding wire is bolted on. Then three thermoplastic bushings are inserted. Workers connect the low voltage lead to the thermoplastic bushings, then bolt the bushings to the tank. They adhere an oil-filling guide to the side of the tank to prevent the bushings from falling off. Then position an automated filling machine. A machine fills the tank with mineral oil, drawing a vacuum to make sure the oil disperses throughout the coil and core. The oil is used for its thermal and insulating properties. An internal fault detector will alert maintenance crews if there's a short circuit. A worker runs lead wire through the thermoplastic bushing and secures it in place. Next comes the high voltage connector. Finally, the tank cover is bolted shut. nation, so to speak, is finished. Before transformers go into service, they have to undergo some truly electrifying tests. This equipment simulates a 145,000 volt lightning strike. Then it's into a water tank to test the transformer for leaks. If it passes muster, it could soon be appearing on a pole near you.","Electric transformers.

What did you bring with you? So I wanted to share it with you So if you would like to see how I packed my train case and everything I brought along then please keep watching Here is my train case I bought this at Sephora and I had that in a haul video I'll link the haul video because I was deciding between I'm going to show you how I start to use the black one. pack my train case. I'll start off here on the left side at the very top. I have my aquafor and then I also have a clear eyes just in case my eyes get a little dry. And then I moved on to the face stuff. So I have my Makeup Forever powder as well as my Maybelline Dream Matte powder. And just because I have some extra space right here I'm going to put in my matte fluid line. Those fit really nice and tightly. And then for a little more face stuff I have some concealer. concealer is back here, so I'm going to use my Nars Stick Concealer. I have an Hourglass concealer that I'm testing out and my Maybelline Mineral Powder. I also depotted a little bit of my L'Oreal Studio Secrets Primer, so I'll just put that in there too. And then I also have my favorite Longcome Photogenic Concealer. This is an old discontinued one, but I really love it. Just pop that in there as well. And then moving on to the second row, I have my Dior Shimmer Powder in Amber Diamond. And then I have another Illuminizing product. This is the MAC Mineralize Skin Finish in Petty Coat. I love this pink color. And then I have my favorite blush and bronzer. This is Stila's Bronzing Powder and then Tarte Expose. I'll just put that there since they're pretty thin. I like to stack them there. And then this was kind of my go-to blush during this whole trip. It's Coralista by Benefit. So I just put a little divider here so things don't move around. and the Coralista has its own little slot back here. And then just because I have a little bit of extra space right here, I have my little scooping spatula thing in case I want to mix anything. So now for this side I'm going to start with my eye products. I have a whole bunch of pencils, a couple of mascaras, my favorite Urban Decay Cannonball. I'm also testing out this Harrow and Make Long and Curl mascara. And also my NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil and Milk. And a whole bunch of liquid and pencil eyeliners. I also have my pencil sharpener and my Shiseido eyelash curler, which I just kind of stuck in that same area. And then over here, I'm going to put a few lip glosses down. These are just the MAC lip glosses. I also have my nail clippers. And then I also put my eyelash glue up here. And I'll just lay my false eyelashes on top. This is my dolly wing false eyelash case. I also have my hair thing. This keeps my bangs out of my face. I just kind of, you know, put that in the general area up here. And then in this last section I kind of put in miscellaneous things. I have a pin just in case. Sometimes a little needle is handy. I also have my goodie spin pins and my little H&M hair bow, a couple bobby pins. And this is a little travel Eve Pearl eyebrow trimmer just because I can fold this up. It's really handy so I stuck that back there as well. And then moving on to this section I have my lip products the one that takes up the most space is this Urban Decay naked lipstick I couldn't fit it in this way because it doesn't really fit so I have that going sideways in the back and I have my Maybelline baby lips and I have a couple of Christian Dior lipsticks And then over here going the other direction I have a couple of Revlon lip butters and then just because you always need a red lipstick here and there I have my NYX black label lipstick So back here I used some of my miscellaneous liquids that I need during the trip. So I have my travel pre and spirit. This is to clean my brushes. I also have my Urban Decay travel all nighter spray. That's to set my makeup because I knew I'd be doing a lot of things on camera all day. I also have my favorite eyebrow pencil. This is the Leo Ellie Artist eyebrow pencil and Leo Ellie lip gloss because it was too big to kind of fit in any of these other sections. So I just put that there. And then to fill out this last little spot I have one of my glass nail files. So now for this main bottom section I have a really large area and then a smaller area just because I wanted to separate some of my really large items with some of my smaller items that stand upright. So to start with the big space I wanted to bring my NYX glitter palette just because I didn't know if I wanted to do I decided to bring something that had a lot of glitter in color. I wasn't sure if I was going to use my airbrush or not, so I brought it along. This is my Diner airbrush. I'm gonna stick this back here. I have my beloved Naked palette. And I also, in case I wanted some color, I brought my Urban Decay Anniversary palette. It has lots of bright colors, so it's easy to just bring one set that has a lot of glitter in it. a lot in it. And then for more basics just in case, this is my Inglot palette that has quite a lot of my basic colors like green, blue, purple. These are from my Stila Barbie palette that has some of my favorite bright colors. And then some of my basic neutrals that are, um, these are actually MAC eye shadows. I also brought a few of my hard case favorite false eyelashes. These are lash and lashes and a couple different styles. And I also wanted to bring some of my favorite L'Oreal infallible singles. This is just the black with the glitter in it, and then this is Matt Dark Brown. And just in case I needed to clean up any makeup mistakes, this is the Kirkland Daily Facial Cleansing Talettes. I don't love using these on my face, but they're great for the rest of the body. And of course, one of my favorite princess mirrors, just because it's nice to have a good mirror when you're getting ready. And then finally, in this left side, I have my nail polishes and foundations. I have my sinful colors. This is a blue called Cinderella. I have this bright color from China Glaze called Surfing for Boys. This is Leo Ellie. I think it's called Peach Pink. Wet and Wild, just white one that I picked up. A couple of reds. My favorite top coat from Sesh V. And then finally my foundations that I brought along. Of course my Makeup Forever Matte Velvet this is my Neutrogena healthy skin foundation, which is great for wearing on an everyday basis And then I also brought a little travel-sized Misha perfect cover BB cream. So that's the entire contents of my train case Pull this together So I guess that's about it Thank you guys so much for watching it if you would like any more pictures or information about my train case where I bought it the things in it I will list that all on my blog that'll be up from head to toe.com And if you have any questions for me, you can also ask me on Twitter.

Here is my train case I bought this at Sephora and I had that in a haul video I'll link the haul video because I was deciding between this one in a pink one I ended up going with the black one. Let me just open it up for you. So as you can see the two doors open up and there are a couple of drawers these pull out to the side just like that. And all of these little things are actually adjustable. You can pull those in and out and then there's big ones down here as well. I put some extras down here at the bottom. Some of these extra pieces that I know I'm not going to use. Alright so now I'm going to show you how I start to pack my train case. I'll start off here on the left side at the very top.

I came to take the flag and the flag, and I went to the Torah, from the sea to the sea. and they went from place to place. Once I went to the Naman Temple and there were prayers that were written in the verses. What are my prayers? And the prayers were written in the English language. They were written on the wall and they were told to go to the temple. And I didn't tell them that it was me at home. And I went to study. So you would be more familiar with me. Bill Gates, he is not familiar with what I was. And I learned Torah. Why didn't you learn Torah? I told them, I don't know how to read. You see, you're free to go anywhere you want. You go anywhere you want. Here you go anywhere you want. So he remembers the lines of Avnon Icaga, he says, you know what? Ganaheddin, look! He says, there's Ganaheddin, let's see what there is. He enters Ganaheddin, shhh! From the streets, to the faking halls, the police stations, music, Pesto Galí, the streets of the mountains, Ganaheddin, they're sitting on the streets, they're standing in front of the door.

There was no one here who asked me to go. Do you want to go? He said, yes, but I can go. No, I have a visa. He said, no problem, go. He went in. How cool. Everything is cool. He says, What is this? What is this? He said to him, what is happening here? He said to him, if you have a soul, I will be in the church, you will not have a soul. He said, you have a soul, but I entered, I entered, look! He went to the soul, suddenly he saw a tree, wow wow wow, he threw his clothes, they are beautiful, and people in the soul, and children, and if, if, who is this? They say, this is the one. They are being punished. What are they doing here? They say they are doing a lot of things, they are not allowed to be punished, so they were given the possibility to be freed. So they did a kind of a ceremony, a ceremony like this, a reception, and they said, you are free to do what you want, and everyone is free to be punished in this place. He said, what are you saying? What is it? What is good about it? He said, you know what is good about it? He is a man. Two minutes later, he suddenly hears the gong. Bong! Kaross says, We will kill the Knesset! Bye! They say, they will kill them in this place only because of the Knesset. All the Knessets are dead. He will get a weapon. He will die. He will return to the palace, to the palace, to the palace. He will come to the Knesset. He will see a shadow. Full of eyes! Full of eyes! But he opened the door! He said, you didn't go, who enters here, you don't want to go! But I don't have a visa! He said, you don't know how to read? No idea. Ravot, Mahashavot, Belavish, the sun rise, you're gone! Don't you smile at the story!

And while treatments have proven to be inconsistent, a new study is encouraging to researchers. It seems that large doses of vitamin B slowed the development of memory problems in older adults. Here's ABC's Dr. Timothy Johnson with our Medical Minute. The study was the largest of its kind to assess the effects of vitamins B6 and B12 on mild cognitive impairment, the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of actual dementia. B vitamins are known to help the body turn food into energy and create red blood cells. 168 people aged 70 or older with mild memory problems participated in the two-year study. Half the participants were given a strong dose of B vitamins and folic acid, the other half were given placebo. MRI technology was then used to measure the rate of brain shrinkage. But researchers say the prescribed dosage was 300 times the recommended daily intake of the supplement B12 and 15 times that of B6. Because of this, the authors call the pill a drug, not a vitamin supplement.

Добрый день, для меня это огромное удовольствие быть приглашённым ещё раз в ваш удивительный город. Я уверена, что погода будет сегодня хорошая. Я высаживала одно из роз на одной из композиций в этом саду под проливным дождем и я молилась, чтобы сегодня погода была хорошей. в рамках года Франции в России принять участие в этом замечательном петербургском событии и фестивала императорские сады России. Французские сады на берегах Невы учения всего лично выражают то значение, которое имеют французские сады во всем мире. Поехали! Сейчас мы пойдем и спросим, Катя, что это она тут разгуливает в таком виде. Причем погула очень такая холодная. Спасибо, Катя.

Вау, супер! Я очень люблю Малевичу, но я еще безумно люблю Кандинского Шагала. Я бы с ума приобрела для своей семьи что-нибудь с этими художниками. Будет такое? Будет обязательно.

This festival has become the prelude of the White Nights, and in our modest summer, it is celebrated The colors are very beautiful. Dear friends, I am glad to welcome you to the opening of the festival. As you can see, the Russian Museum keeps its word. We promised that this festival will become a traditional, annual festival. And this is the way to prepare for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of our festival. to be once again invited to your beautiful city. And I arranged as you can see that the weather would be nice today. Yesterday I was planting a rose in one of the exhibits in the pouring rain and I prayed very much that today would be beautiful. I planted one of the roses on one of the compositions in this garden under the pouring rain and I prayed that the weather today was good. Hello! The foundation of the Jordan Park of France, in the framework of the year Franco-Russ, is very happy to be associated with this very beautiful manifestation of the Imperial Gardens of St. Petersburg. in the framework of the French years in Russia, to participate in this wonderful St. Petersburg event and the Festival of the Imperial Gardens in Russia. These French gardens on the borders of the Neva reflect very well the image that the French gardens give in the world. French gardens on the banks of the Neva, very symbolize the importance of the French gardens in the whole world. Let's go! Let's ask Katya what she is doing here. It's very cold here. Thank you, Katya. Apart from the opening of Emperor's garden in this wonderful, beautiful Mikhailovsky garden, we saw some very spontaneous, maybe improvisation, while the fashion. Katya, tell us, Katya, I forgot that you don't like how they call you Katya, although you have a beautiful name. I hope that they will find a new line of clothes. collection of the Russian Museum collection of the Russian Museum in this case this is Kazimir Malevich a singer famous singer of the Russian avant-garde it is his work most likely for clothes because here are such local flowers by the way by the way about the colors of the oxen that loves everything bright and colorful as well as I wanted to use the oxen in the case of gifts I want to say that there are very few of them so far. I think that there are only Russian museums in the future. I love Malivich very much, but I still love Kandinsky's Shagala very much. I would like to buy something for my family with these artists. Will it be like this? It will be, of course. I'm not sure about the ball. It will be a surprise. Thank you! We will be sure of your promise. Now I'm going to dress up in this wonderful vest because it's already very cold. The Russian Museum will dig up the ground. We begin the landing. Please come out, guys. Marko shows the rose. He says that the rose is so bright. You have brought a light to light the rose, which was named after him. and the middle of May to the cold"

Clairement reçoit tout long. Broke James. Le demi-douverture, clairement tour. Le demi-douverture australien va lancer les hostilités. C'est parti pour cette vingtième journée du top 14. C'est parti pour cette... Le ancien Clermontois qui passe par le sol. Il va falloir sortir avec du pied. C'est une zone de pression. Il y a eu plusieurs temps de jeu. Voilà. C'est fait un petit peu trop long cette chandelle de Can Thépomis. Dans les bras de Benoit Bhabie. Benoit Bhabie, Kistallov. Le fœur qui est passé, il a du soutien. Bien relevé ce ballon pour Wesley Fofana. Wesley Fofana qui a levé la tête, la belle vissée pour Canalé. La croise avec couche, et le déco-pocre à Maldieu. Quel bel initiative d'Éclare Montoie dans les 22 mètres. Julien Maldieu mise au sol. Nouveau temps que je meurt gagne par à la sortie, et belle. La sortie est rapide avec Bourdiemse. On revient à l'intérieur sur Vermeulen. C'est bien redisposé côté Toulonnet, mais ce sont les Clare Montoie qui sont à la manoeuvre avec Zirac et Achvili. Pour une fixation, dans l'axe des potos, une quinzaine de mètres. Le drop de Philou de Morgan Para. Le drop qui permet à Clermont de mener 6 à 0. Le match avec Jean-Jeu Smith, mal Dieu, on va pouvoir écarter. Et le jouet au pied tendu de Brant James. Il a trouvé un bon angle. Brant James, avec Wulf, qui va remonter ce ballon. L'intervention à Lolle Black, qui ne passera pas face à Rougry. Le public est grande parce qu'il estime que Wulf n'a pas libéré en étant au sol. La libération de Della Blemper m'a amené à Mignoni d'enchaîner sur le côté fermé. Et on écarte avec Conteepomi du soutien dans la ligne. La passe, le jeu dans le dos avec Lovoy Balavou. Il faut sortir, il faut sortir, il faut être servi. Paul Sake n'est pas décalé. Il va échapper un placage, il a remis à l'intérieur. Et c'est finalement Maldieu qui va conceder. Il va conceder le tour du tour du tour. Et ça a manqué d'agressibilité peut-être sur la défense de Toulon parce qu'il y avait un coup intéressant à faire. On va jouer jusqu'au bout cette action. Peut-être un en avant de Kudmore, laquille chappé à Monsieur Péchambere. C'était un coup gagnant pour les Toulonais. On va y revenir dans quelques secondes après le dégagement de Bronzens. Attention, il va jouer rapidement. Et Mignoni joue rapidement. Toulon qui embale avec Rudi Wulf dans la ligne. À l'entrée des 22 mètres, Rudi Wulf en percussion. Stoppé. Il a trouvé du soutien, il faut rebondir rapidement dans le côté fermé, c'est fait avec Mignoni. Je ne vois les appuis du Talonneur. Jean-Philippe, je ne vois plaquer. On arrive tout doucement au quart d'heure de jeu. Clermont Mensis à 0. Mais ce sont les Toulonais qui sont les plus dangereux depuis quelques secondes avec Laissez ! Laissez qui se décident au Vo-Balavou un contrat et c'est oui ! C'est fait ! C'est fait Monsieur Pechember à corps de Laissez ! C'est Daloua. Tout l'honnêt ce n'est pas l'Ovo-Balavou, effectivement c'est Eloua qui a fait parler sa puissance lui l'ancien numéro 8 qui a déjà joué troisième de cette saison et bien c'est lui qui conclut ce temps fort Toulonais. On sentait déjà tout à l'heure sur l'incursion avec l'Ovo-Balavou qui avait décalé Paul Sakey Le bon travail de George Mies, la lucidité sur le 3 contre 2. Il choisit la bonne solution, celle de la passe sautée pour Lovoy Balavou. Il va fixer Vermelaine et sur la sautée battre Julien Maldieu. La finition en force de Lovoy Balavou face à Brock James. C'est difficile de stopper l'ancien numéro 8 en puissance d'Ae Lua.

Morgan Para, Brogd James, la passe au tendo pour personne. Rougerie qui pousse au pied dans le dos. Attention à Bonnerre. Bonnerre qui est... Oh, les serveurs ! Magie ! Le drible de Julien Bonnerre qui permet à Clermont de marquer cette essai en deuxième période. Clermont qui mène maintenant 17 à 5. Un jeu sur l'extérieur avec cette passe qui avec le rebond va trouvée. le premier dans cette seconde période. Toujours cette volonté farouche détournée pour produire du jeu, pour relancer, mais peut-être à la limite, la réussite, l'efficacité ce soir. Peut-être le lancer de la dernière chance pour eux, dans l'optique de la recherche et du gain du point de bonus. Le ballon qui est capté, mis au sol immédiatement. On va travailler. George Smith, le coup d'œil. On va partir peut-être avec Scofield. Percussion épaulé par Vivaldi. Et au gratage, le Waki. Il faut qu'il relâche. Le drôle de Benoît-Baby, il est parti ! Au moment où retentit la sirene, ça rebondit au Fédé-Poteau, attention de ne pas commettre de faute. C'est terminé, Benjamin Lapère, il faut dégager ! Benjamin Lapère qui prend des risques considérés. Philippe Saint-André qui ne comprend pas trop. Moi qui n'a pas entendu la sirene, Benjamin Lapère. Il l'a entendu, que George Smith lui aussi. Alors là, Philippe Saint-André, hysterique, il faut trouver la touche, attention de ne pas commettre de faute, garder les appuis, on va en rester là. Un point, c'est déjà pas mal. Voilà, ça y est. C'est terminé. À 12 victoires du champion, victoire de Clermont face à Toulon. Mais Toulon arrache in extremis le bonus défensif. Ouf, ouf pour les Toulonnés qui se sont fait peur jusqu'au bout.","The game is over, Marcel Michelin is on the pitch. Brog James is on the pitch. The opening is over. The Australian opening is over. The hostility is over. It's the 20th day of the Top 14. It's the 7th. Clermontois is on the pitch. We have to get out of the pitch. There were many times when the pressure was high. It's been a bit too long. It's well-disposed on the side of Toulonnet, but it's the Clermontois who are at the top with Zirac and Chvili. The release of the Dalla Blemme allows Mignoni to go on the closed side. And we're out with Contepomi, support in the line. Pass, the game in the back with Lovoy Balavu. Lovoy Balavu who passed, you have to get out. You have to get out, you have to be served. Paul Sake is not off. He will escape a score, he put it back inside. And it's finally Malzio who will concede. Who will concede. The touch in the back. Yes, he's not out, he's out. It missed aggressiveness, maybe on defense. Of all the long, because there was something interesting to do. Maybe a kill-off for Qtm, which was managed by Mr. P. Chamber. It was a win for the Toulonais. We'll come back in a few seconds after the break-up of Bronson. Minioni quickly plays. Toulon, who scores with Rudi Wulf in the line. At the entrance of the 22m, Rudi Wulf in the lead. Stopped. He found support. We have to rebound quickly in the closed side and it's done with Minioni. I see the support of the Talonneur. Jean-Philippe, I see him in the lead. We're slowly coming to the quarter-hour of the game. Clermont-Mensic, it's 0-0. But it's the Toulonais who are the most dangerous for a few seconds with the C. The C who decides to meet the Ballavou. And it's done! It's done! Mr. Pechembert agrees to let the Toulonais. It's not the Ballavou, it's Eloua who made him talk about his power. He, the old number 8 who already played 3rd of this season, it's him who concludes this Toulonais time. We already felt earlier on the incursion with the Ballavou who had fallen. Look at the good work of George Mies, the lucidity on the 3 vs 2. He chooses the right solution, that is to say the one not jumping for Lovoy Balavou. Look, he will fix Vermeulen and finally on the jump, to beat Julien Maldieu. And you see the finish in force of Lovoy Balavou against Brock James. Obviously difficult to stop the old number 8, in power of A'Euluea. This A'Euluea, which marks this trial. The choice of the foot, the choice of the throw. So they will not make it to the foot. He's going to get out with the support of his fans, especially Jovan Nikerk, who is committed. Morgan Para, Brog James, Pass on Tando for Personne, Rougery, who pushes his foot in the back. Watch out for Bonner. Bonner is here. Magic! Julien Bonner's dribble, which allows Clermont to score. This trial in the second period. Clermont now leads 17-5. A bit confusing situation. And finally, a game on the outside with this pass, which with the rebound. Here, we have Aurélien Rougeri. Look at the pass from Brog James. We often talk about Aurélien Rougeri, his lack of experience. He's a 3-4-cent player, a small kick to follow. And then, Julien Boner's legs. He's going to take the best on the ball. Trouble to accompany this ball in the goal and conclusion. Completely against the court of the game. Clermont scores. The first in this second period. Always this red-haired will to take the game back, but maybe at the limit, the success, the efficiency tonight. Maybe the last chance for them in the search and the bonus point. The ball is captured, put on the ground immediately. We will work with George Smith, the elbow. We will go with Scofield. Percussion and for the Parvivaldi. And for Gratage, the Waki. That's it. It's over. 12 wins for the champion, a victory for Clermont against Toulon. But Toulon is extremely good at defending. Ouf, Ouf for the Toulonnets who got scared to the end."

Y una de las cosas que me ha pasado, es que yo hace tiempo recibí, o me colgaron, o encontré porque alguien me enlazó por el internet un vídeo de una chica que hacía una versión mía que era color bandarina y normalmente hay algunas versiones que estoy muy guay que me han pedido a ver si me ha arrepentido y me dice, mola y a veces te da miedo a ti no reconocer la canción pero te dice, seguro que era mía pero el caso es que te da una vez esa versión que me jodó bastante ojiplática y dice que es bien cante, era muy curiosa porque no decía ni quién era y aparecía otra chica o otro ser a su lado, porque no se leía la cara que enseñaba papeles con cosas escritas y decía que bien, pero no le puedo decir nada porque no se quiere. Y que se me daré más lista que yo, se entero de quién era y que hacía la vida de las chicas que hoy todos han visto, Tiz Carmen y me ha parecido maravilloso compartir la canción con la que la conocí. Así que, ¡venté acá! Señora, a la señora Zahar, me gustaba mucho su música, entonces hice una versión y al ver que un momento me venía a tocar las dos y eso, yo colaborando que había mi imaginación en mi... bueno, decidió mensaje en Facebook y me contestó, entonces... no es un buen momento.

And there are usually some verses that I am very cool, that I wanted to sing for you, and I said, cool. And sometimes I get scared, because I do not recognize the song, but I say, surely, it is my fault. The case is that this was a version that I played quite a bit of Oji and Plática, and I said, I was curious because they didn't tell me who they were, and they looked like other girls or other beings, I was surprised because I couldn't see their faces, they showed me papers with things written on them and they said, I'm fine, but I can't say anything because I don't know who they are. And the most interesting thing about me, I don't know who they were, and they made me realize that they are the girls I've seen so far, Thierce Carmen, and it seemed wonderful to me to share the song with the ones I met her. So, come here. I was a good singer, I liked her music a lot, I did a version of her, and I liked her because she was here playing, I collaborated with her in Imaginación, she sent me a message and she answered me. It was a good thing. I was very excited because she was already in the band. You can't have everything. I've signed it. And now I'm going to have to do it badly so she appears to be singing. Sorry. I'm careful. If she has a guitar."

So for the public and all the volunteers, it's important. After that, we had to score as many points as possible to have a small chance to qualify. As soon as the ball hits the goalie, the Valdois take their opponents and sign a first touchdown by the midfielder, Sebastien Taurel. It's the beginning of an offensive festival where the goalies gain points at a speed and a break. In the meantime, the score shows an improbable 45-0 in favor of the loco. We took them to the goal at the start and the idea was not to let them get out of the water. The defense, it made a great pass, giving us good positions. The players are still on their clouds.

Саме таку кількість ліцензій виборили наші спортсмени на змаганнях світового та європейського рівнів. Сьогодні було оголошено у весь перелік учасників 30-ї з заліком Літньої Олімпіади. Хто з них дійсно претендує на коштовно-Олімпійський метал, аналізував Сергій Омальчик. Олімпійці на Олімпійському. Серед головними стартами 4 річчя, кількість олімпійських ліцензій дозволяє замахнутися на вагомий сумарний здобуток. Котрій вже має серед своїх надбань бронзової, серібну медалі готовий зазіхнути і на золоту на городу Олімпіади. Він найдосвідченіший у Збірні, тому прапор на церемонії відкриття не з тими саме він. Я гордий, що я українець, я патріосовий, я державий. Якщо я довірили мені нести прапор нашої держави і ти першим на відкритті Олімпійських ігров, треба його нести гордого, щоб не спідкнутися, не дай Бог жалент. Чи б не було сором. Вито вивезнання у нашій команді достатньо перспективних спортсменів. Зокрема рекордсмен світу серед юніворів з метання диску Микита Нестеренко. Його показники у цьому сезоні одні з найкращих у світі. Тому, попри шалену конкуренцію, наш атлет їде до Лондона за перемогою. 20 людей всі мітають, і в сантиметрах розходяться. Олімпіада – це такий старт волнительний, поїхав прощитувати на свою уверенность. Як витримати напруження і не змарнувати результати веснажливої підготовки до Ігор планетарного масштабу, знають ті, хто вже проторивав собі шлях до Олімпійського п'ядесталу.

Це дуже важко, щоб ти, коли закончилась твоя дистанція, то ли в плавні, то ли в легкій атлеті, то ли, коли закончился бой твой, ти вилежився до конца. Тот, хто може потерпити більше, чем інші, ті будуть победителями. Чотири попередні олімпіади принесли Україні вражай із 96 медалий. До того шостанній, літній ігри 2008 року у Пекині були найпродуктивнішими. Жортосині здобули 27 нагорота. на чотири більше, ніж 96-го, 2000-го і 2004-го. Чи вдасться перевершити рекордний показник, де знаємось рівно за місяць, коли на Туманному альбіоні відлунають останні акорди ювілейних 30-х Олімпійських Ігор?

The entire rally was announced today, with the participants of the 30th annual Winter Olympics. Who really intends to analyze the gold medal? The Olympic license allows us to get on the weight of the sum of the income. We have 210-220 license. Today we have 245 license. It is really wonderful and positive. It is a great event on the planet and also for us, for Ukrainians, we are a sports country. It is very important. Among the main contenders on the medal are judoists and Roman Hontsky. Kotriy already has a bronze medal ready to be worn on the gold medal at the Olympic Games. He is the most experienced in the national team, so the pride on the opening ceremony is not the same as he is. I am proud that I am Ukrainian and I am a patriot of my country. If you trust me, you will bring me the pride of our country and you are the first to open the Olympic Games. You need to bring him pride so that you don't get caught up in God's hands, so that you don't get quarreled. World cup winners in our team have enough perspective athletes, especially the world recorders among the UNIORI, the Dysk and Nesterenko. His supporters in this season are one of the best in the world, so, according to the crazy competition, our athlete goes to London to win the victory. 20 people are all in the same place, and the distance is 1 cm. The Olympics are such a exciting start, and we will count on our confidence. How to maintain the tension and not waste the results of the overall preparation for Igor Planetarnev's scale, know those who have already passed the Olympic Games in Sobyshlyak. The silver medal of Igor Usidnyi and Denis Silantyev is shared with the news. The big solutions are to lose a lot of strength, sweat, blood. It is very important that when your distance is over, whether in swimming, or in a light athlete, or when your fight is over, you will be out of the way. Whoever can suffer more than others, they will be victorious. The four previous Olympics brought the enemy from 96 medals to Ukraine. Until the last summer game of 2008 in Beijing, they were the most productive. The yellow-blue ones got 27 awards. for four more than 1996, 2000 and 2004.

The main transport means is cycling. It ends up being the most efficient transport. It's much cheaper, much more viable. I don't take much. It's a bit more infrastructure in the city. You have more respect for traffic and places for you to stop cycling. I'm not sure if I'm going to hear about the lack of education, the pedestrian, who is driving and who is also cycling. I'm going very slowly, but I'm going very slowly because when I'm a pedestrian I get scared of other cyclists who come at high speed. If I put my bicycle in the middle of the street I will be risking my life. Thanks to the pedestrian, I was afraid of my bike. Thanks. Thank you very much!"

The glory of the ferro villa that made many happy. For me, the best of all, Pedro Carrillo Fritz. We also lived with Fritz. as the children of the creator, processions of advances. I thank God. I remember the month of Mary above that tractor, the people singing in chorus, alleluia to the Lord. It was the people's party on the streets walking. We would come to the church to start over. There were also trains, sounds that I still hear. singing all night, visiting the devotees with a cabito de vela and a little singing of the monster. The stars of the sky, each one has its name. Where are the owners of the house? What do I speak and do not answer? What I write is an attempt to leave all that in memory. It is a legacy, a contribution to our history. Many are missing to name.

That has a microphone input jack as well, so you're gonna get much better quality if you buy a camera that has a microphone input jack on it. And we're gonna hear that, that sounds right now. So here's the two other microphones I'll be comparing. This is the AudioTetica wired lavalier. Basically it is a wired lavalier microphone. It has a battery, a little watch battery goes with it. and there's the microphone jack that you'll plug in to the camera. The problem with this microphone are the cables. As you can see there's a mess of cables and actually try to keep this organized by keeping it rolled around a pin but as you can tell it's just impossible. It would take me about five minutes to actually untangle all of this and figure it all out. So I'm not going to worry about that right now. That will be a project for another time. Let's just go ahead and put this on and hear how it sounds. So I'm going to plug this in into the microphone and plug this into the side of the camera. Alright, so now the microphone is turned on and I'm hoping that you can tell that the quality is much better now. A couple of key things to remember about a microphone is number one is how the voice sounds but also about silence because you don't want any background noise. A lot of times a microphone can have hissing so I'm going to be quiet for a minute and you should hear if there's any silence. Obviously my voice is much better with this microphone but hopefully the silence is better too. There should be less hissing using this microphone. Now one thing you may want to notice is the fact that if you're just listening to this on your computer speakers then you probably can't hear the hissing very well because the fact the speakers are in the room somewhere and it's not very close. But a lot of people do listen to these videos with headsets on. If you have a technical video that someone may be watching at work or they just may be listening to it at home and have headsets on. And when you have a headset on, it's much easier to hear the noise. So if you're listening to this video and you don't have a pair, if you don't have your headsets on or I mean your headphone on, then get a pair of headphones, put them on and listen to it and you'll hear a much bigger difference in the background noise. So I'll keep quiet for one more second so you can listen. All right, now this is the Audio Technica ATR3350 Leveller microphone and I got it off amazon.com for $20. And obviously a good microphone, cheap $20, it can't be that, but the wires are a mess. I can move around the room, all this other stuff but the whole time I'm doing it I have to manage this mess of wire. Now let's turn this off and I'm going to switch over and we'll switch over to the wireless microphone. This is W-R35 so Audio Technica Pro 80W R35 wireless microphone for $125. You have two units. The first one is the receiver. This has the wire that you actually plug into the camcorder. Here's the receiver. two channels and then you have a transmitter here. Obviously it still has a cable, still has a wire but it's just a small wire so this close onto your bow clip, this clips onto your collar and there's no wires otherwise so it's much more convenient than a fully wired microphone. I'm going to put this into the camera now and see how it sounds. You have to turn both units on. These actually run off 9 volt batteries, 2 9 volt batteries so you have to have both of them turned on and they both have to be on the same frequency frequency for this to work. I can walk around the room and I still get great range of quality according to the specifications it says you have like 25 feet and I mean once you kind of get too far away from the camera you really can't see yourself anyway so I don't think that's as far I think of the practical range is really Perfect good. The benefit is of course just moving around wire-free now since there is hissing I don't like hissing at all in my videos and What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back and take this video and put it through audacity and take out the hissing so Up until this point in the video, I'm going to leave the hissing in and then I'm going to edit the video on my computer and remove the hissing so you can hear it. So as of this point right here, there should be no more hissing. So this is the part that I have edited with Audacity and the hissing has turned off. So once again, I'll be quiet again so you can listen. This should be much cleaner now that I'm actually running it through the computer filter. So Audacity is a free program. Just Google it and you just have an option on there called noise removal and it takes a sample of the silence with some hissing in it and then it goes ahead and removes that hissing from the rest of the video and it should sound pretty clean. And the only problem I've noticed with Audacity is that every now and then when you're talking it goes a little bit high-pitched every now and then but that's pretty minor and I don't think it's very noticeable but there are better noise removal programs out there. I'm also using Sony Vegas which I think is called Soundforge. I forgot what they call it. Soundforge Audio. I forget But anyway, that one actually cleans up the noise really well, much better than Audacity, but that costs money. So what you're listening to right now has just been cleaned up with Audacity filter. And that is my video. Hope you like it. So we looked at the camera microphone by itself, which sounds pretty good. But once we put on the wired lavalier, the Audio Technica ATR3350 for $20, the sound went much better and the hissing really went away. But the problem is it does have a wire. And the one I have on right now, the Audio Technica Pro, ADAW, R35. $120 and excellent because you can walk around, you can move around and not have to worry about wires. Just maybe if you want go back on your computer and clean out the hissing in the background if you really want it to be as good as possible. And that's it. Hope you liked it.","Hi, it's Brian Michelle and welcome to this audio review of different microphones So I'm gonna compare three different microphones and let you be the judge which ones sound better than the other ones So the first thing I'm doing is I'm recording this on a Canon Vixia HFM30 and it's just a microphone in the front So as I'm talking then my voice is just being projected in the microphone and it should sound fine But hopefully by buying some additional microphones we can do better because the this Canon and as well as the Kodak Z8, ZI8, I'm not sure how you pronounce it.

Come prima cosa, andiamo sul sito ufficiale di Minecraft www.minecraft.com e qui come potete vedere troviamo Multiplayer Beta Server questo è il file per il single player invece scarichiamo il file del server potete trovarli per Windows e per altri sistemi operativi come Linux etc. in questo caso io scarico quello per Windows e salvare la e si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può farcire un'altra carta che si può far il server è pronto e si può effettuare il login. Tutto questo procedimento della preparazione del mondo succede solo la prima volta che avviate un vostro server infatti se io racchiudo e riapro il server come potete vedere è molto più veloce non c'è tutto quel procedimento che è successo prima. Lasciamo un attimo da parte il server e torniamo nella carta il file che ci interessa modificare è questo server che è come tipo file properties premete con il tasto destro su questo file e fate l'opzione apricone e selezionate il blocco note io ce l'ho già selezionato di default perché avendo già più server ce l'ho già impostato come potete vedere vi si apre il file L'evel name è il nome del vostro mondo, in questo caso è word, perché qui il nostro mondo si chiama word. Qui potete abilitare il nether, la distanza vensiva, lo spawn dei mostri, settarlo su true o false, l'online mod. L'online mod è una cosa molto importante. Se lasciate su true, potranno entrare potranno entrare nel vostro server solo le persone che hanno un account premium se mettete su false invece potranno entrare nel vostro server anche le persone che hanno un normalissimo client craccato non c'è bisogno di avere l'account premium settando questo parametro su false qui la difficoltà, un game mode che sarebbe creative eccetera lo sponde gli animati il numero massimo di player tutti i parametri che comunque non vi interessa andare a modificare di solito si modificano all level name nel caso in cui voi inseriate un nuovo mondo e volete cambiargli il nome da caricare e l'online mod ora io rimetto su tru l'online mod salva chiudi e per entrare nel server, io utilizzo sia server con amaci che con bucket, in questo caso è semplice in entrambi i casi, quello con bucket è sicuramente più bello come server, perché ci sono molti plugin e potete mettere molte cose particolari, però quello con amaci è sicuro più in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in questo caso, in il mio server è app nel caso non lo abbiate già nella lista dovete fare add server mettere il nome del server come volete che rimane chiamato non lo so server di un bu nel server address incollare l'indirizzo ipv4 che trovate su amaci la prima parte di indirizzo se premete qui con il tasto destro potete fare appunto copi e poi incollarlo qua. per vedere tutti i comandi da console se scrivete help e quindi app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app anche se non penso che avrete problemi con quello e per qualsiasi domanda lasciatemi pure un commento o scrivetemi sulla pagina di Facebook sulla mail di YouTube anche se sapete che la odio penso ve l'ho detto in 100.000 video diversi e nei prossimi video forse farò vedere anche come creare un server con bookkit e magari qualche plugin che è disponibile per un server o stato combookit. Mi scuso se il video non è stato sicuramente tra i più corti di eventuali guide che potete trovare su come ostare un server però ho voluto fare un video molto tranquillo in cui vi spiegavo, penso, abbastanza bene i diversi passaggi. Se il video vi è piaciuto e vi è stato utile lasciate un bel mi piace, commentate in caso iscriviti al mio canale e che dire alla prossima ciao","Hello everyone, I'm Ambu and in this video you see the big requests of help on how to install or modify the parameters of a server to make the login even with non-premium account I will make a small guide on how to create and set your server as first thing let's go to the official minecraft website www.minecraft.com here we have the file for Windows and other operating systems Now we create a folder called Minecraft Server. We move the file we just downloaded. We open it. As you can see, the server is loading data. Now it is preparing our world. When this script appears, it means that we have to download the file. The server is ready and you can log in. All this preparation of the world happens only the first time you open your server. As you can see it is much faster. There is no such procedure as before. The file that we want to modify is this server that is like the properties file. Press the right button on this file and do the option open with and select the note block I have already selected default because having already more servers I have already set it. As you can see, it opens The name of the game is World, you can activate the Nedder, the MN, the Spawn, the Online Mod, the True or False Mod. You can enter only the people who have a premium account. If you put on false instead, you can enter in your server also the people who have a very normal cracked client. There is no need to have the premium account setting this parameter on false. Here the difficulty, game mode that would be creative, etc. The maximum number of players, all the parameters that you don't want to modify, usually they are changed to a level name, in case you insert a new world and you want to change the name to load and the online mode. Now I put back on the online mode, save, close. To enter the server I use both server and mace with bookit. I will use the simple one to determine the points of view. In this case I usually install the pv4 address. Let's take it, copy it. Let's open the server. I'm afraid of error because the server is already open. Let's open Minecraft. In my server and app, you have to add server, name, address, and name. I have a lot of players in Minecraft that I have been in for a long time. The first time you log in you have to give the power to see all the commands from console if you write help it shows the various commands and what they mean in this case you have to give the op to You can see the message in the game, you can go around the server. I think you can leave a comment or write me on the facebook page, on youtube, even if you know I hate it. I think I said it in 100.000 different videos. In the next videos I will show you how to create a server with bookkit and maybe some plugins that are available in the description. I'm sorry if the video was not the shortest of the guides that you can find on how to use a server but I wanted to make a very quiet video in which I explained the different passages quite well if you liked the video and it was useful to you leave a like, comment and subscribe subscribe to my channel and see you next time, bye!"

This is Oka no of Eriotraders Japan. Please also look forward to the main year. It is a shape that allows you to make a move that can be considered as 80.2.4. The transparent is the movement of the river. This is already continuing, but it is also expected to be a move that can break 80.2.4. And it is the daily chart. The daily chart is the minor 4 bar. This is the short-rend 2 bar, which is the analysis of the top. I'm looking at the 4 bars that are moving. This is the third wave. The fourth wave is a flat move called ABC. It is possible to progress the first half of the rice, so some of the wave development can be predicted, but it is not different from any other. If there is a possibility of moving by depending on the limit, or if it is reflected immediately, there is a possibility that the movement towards this 4% and 0% is moving, so if you look at the depth of that area, you will see that there is a need to check it with a further small time frame. However, the current is that it is not that it is not that it is breaking 82.32, but that it is breaking 82.4, so the B-value is below. There are also oscillators below, but the oscillators are too much. This may be more and more below, so I think it's better to keep the divergence in mind and take the lower moves. That's all for today. Everyone, do your best trading this year."

Festival dell'Innovazione tenutosi a Roma dal 7 al 10 Giugno 2007,"editoria, personal, blog, nettv, hitech, festival, giggi, publishing, adsense, webtv, tv, robingood, robin, online, innovazione, good",639,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/YY8cPiGk-Eg.mp3,"Volevate sapere qualcosa di particolare voi su... ma io lo sto dicendo proprio che questo non è un formato vincente, lo è solamente finché è una novità come in questo momento per te che era vero i due primi a volte, diciamo che vuoi andare a casa, per me ce ne sono ancora lì, quindi un giorno o due giorni fa manofare anche a me con i miei amici, ma poi quella cosa sfumerà, perché la novità, il tri del momento sfumerà, quindi quello che sto dicendo è va bene, è fichissimo di fare questa cosa in diretta dall'autobus dal treno, ma quello che ci serve sono delle veri idee, cioè l'innovazione può di colture dal lato tecnologico e metterci dentro un'idea forte su che cosa farai, perché io non penso di essere interessante 24-24, un nero voglio essere, quindi lancerò una televisione fra 15 giorni, ma che non conterà robbingo di indiretta sul prato, qui tutti i giorni, conterà qualcosa che per il momento non ti posso dire, ma che non abbiamo mai visto fino ad adesso nei medie tradizionali e in quelli un po' dal basso. Ti risposto? che diventerà dal format, se il format non riflette quello che già vedi sui canali che esistono, penso di no. È solo un problema di tipo di format, non di modo diverso di usare il mezzo. Tu conquista telecamera, ci puoi mettere davanti quello che vuoi. Non è che per forza chi ha la telecamera deve mettere davanti se stesso, potrebbe mettere davanti, che ne so, che segue tutte le sui lati di moda, piuttosto che fa vedere i partiti di pallone o intervista ai barme e di tutti gli angoli di strada nella notte, non lo so, ci sono mille cose diverse, secondo me però non la puoi fare una tv minestrone, stai acceso, forse qualcuno la può fare, io sto cercando un formato, cioè una declinazione di quello che andrà in onda che è sempre la stessa, cioè voglio accendere RobinWuTV perché so che lì come su tale radio c'è quella musica che mi piace a qualunque ora del giorno della notte, siccome io non posso essere disponibile, tutte quelle ore ho dovuto pensare a qualcosa che magari con l'aiuto di altri e potete indominare, vuoi far fare una caccia a tesoro?","Hi, sorry, sorry. So I'll give you the microphone, if you two arrived too, I didn't hear your names. I'm saying this is not a winning format, it's just a novelty, like for you who had it for the first time, you can go home, I'm still there, so one day or two days, let me do it with my friends, but then that thing will disappear, because the novelty, the moment tree will disappear, so what I'm saying is, it's great, it's great to do this directly from the bus to the train, but what we need are real ideas, that is, innovation, I want to be a black man, so I will launch a television between 15 days, but that will not count live on the stage every day, it will count something that we have never seen before, in the traditional media and in those a little below. Anna? Yes, I'm just curious. But this project has been on the spontaneity, you shoot with the camera, you take what you see and what you see and what you can see all the people who can see it at that moment. Once you start to propose formats with a different size, you don't become much more similar to what you already see on the traditional time. I think it depends on the format, if the format does not reflect what you already have on the channels that exist, I think not. It's just a type of format problem, there is a different way of using the middle. You can put in front of us what you want with this camera.

Here you will see it with you. Although I already have it downloaded, but it doesn't matter. and it is uploaded by me, it downloads completely and the next one will be automatically downloaded here. We are going to the folder where we have downloaded it, which is in library and then you download it and here it is, we are going to go to the office and the office idea, like this, no? After you are going to right click and extract file Now we will extract a folder and we will open it, double click and we will have these 4 files. In the 181 template orbs are the ones that can change, which are several designs that I did a compilation, I was looking for several folders. Now that we are inside the folder, we are going to click right here to this, we are going to run as administrator, if they do not run as administrator, they will not give you the permissions to be able to change the start button of Windows, since it has been opened, we are going to click here, click here and we are going to look for where the folder of the orbs of the templates is, I will look for one that I like very much, which is the Razer, click there and open, then it is changing and here it has already changed, as you can see, let me change so that it looks more high-tech the window changed and as you can see it has changed look and it turns on every time you give it here it turns on green this blue and when it gives it stays green we can do anything like for example I made that eraser we are going to occupy this one which is 0 6802 we open it and there it is changing us there it is look there it appears in gray we close the button and it will be white and it will be white every time we open this tab so, like, comment and for it if you liked the video and see you in another video bye"

Ellos, lo único que mantiene, e que hai que destruir Resolvaix, porque co la destrucción de Resolvaix, se crearan empleos. porque mi deber era defender incluso con mi vida o expuesto de trabajo de Lieres e o polvil de la juventud. Traba xo e 40 anos de Minas. Como non voy luchar yo por la familia. Aqui murieron mxos amigos, vecinos de líderes jóvenes. O último, Minas que se mata aquí, por un joven como tú. Eu creo que há un mal planteamiento. O pozo está onde está porque aí estava o yacimiento. A indústria não tem ninguna dependencia do yacimiento e pode estar ubicada em espacios que reunem mejores condiciones. Pensarem que hai que llevar a cada pueblo e a cada barrio, una indústria para que a gente joven trabaje, é estar en el século XIX. Pero es que además en Lierres, bojo, un meu ponto de vista, aprovechando ese patrimonio, se podia crear empleo, empleo para os jovenes. Por exemplo, a traves de un centro, Que debemos hacer os jovenes? Conservar o nosso pasado? Ou mirar ací adelante sin respetar nos raízes? É necessario destruir para avanzar?","The Lieres was founded in 1903. The way of living in the Lieres changed radically. Being an agrarian society of 19, it became a semi-industrial society. Now that the mines are closing in a progressive way, we are in the final phase, what do we have to do with that patrimonial? Thanks to Solvay, elements like this church have been built in Lieres. In Lieres, the neighbors do not agree. We, the neighboring people of the Ulyai leader, always keep in mind that the preservation of buildings would be more feasible if it was used again. Here in the leader, the opinion of the young people is quite distrustful. They know that they want to defend the Ulyai group, that they do not want to say that they do not believe in job positions, and that they believe that they have a job. We have to destroy it, because work positions can be created in our own ways. The bullet, until today, I have been shown that it does not have any initiative or criteria. It is still exactly the dictates that the mayor of Desierro is looking at. They are the only ones who keep it. We have to destroy Resolvae because with the destruction of Resolvae, employees will be created. because I had to defend myself even with my life, the work of liars and the youth's poverty. In the days when I came to Sierra Calda to see myself, I said, what about me? I will bring the president to the city once and twice. And it is when he promises me the volcage, because of the zero and mainly because of liars. The citizens of the people of liars, because of the company, because of the politicians. I worked here for 40 years, I'm not a good fighter. Many friends died here, neighbors of young leaders. The last leader who was killed here was a young man. The case of leaders is unique because it is a complete heritage of the mining. Not only is the joint related to production, but also the residential space. I think there is a bad idea. The well is where the yacimiento was. The industry has no dependence on the yacimiento and it can be located in spaces that gather better conditions. They thought that it is necessary to take to each town, to each neighborhood, to make the young people work. They are in the 19th century.

No intestines are removed or bypassed during this surgery. So all of the intestines, the bowel and all, everything stays intact. The patient feels full after eating a very small amount of food. There is a procedure that may be more appealing and has minimal stress to the body. That procedure is the adjustable gastric banding.

As you can see in this diagram, only a very small pouch is left at the patient's stomach. The rest of the stomach is not removed, it's left inside the patient, but bypassed from this area at the top of the stomach down into the lower intestines where this part of the intestines are removed. And where the of the intestines have taken place, this area here called the genostomy is created. The volume of the, see, the creation of the genostomy causes malabsorption. So when food is consumed, instead of all the calories that is, that goes into the stomach or the intestines where they're absorbed, it's bypassed. So there won't be absorption of calories.

This procedure has been known for many people to discontinue many medications. Bariatric surgery is a medical procedure for weight loss. The benefits of this surgery are life changing for patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and other diseases.

Her mother and aunt are also members of these groups, and Sarita says there are around twenty such units in her village, consisting of not only housewives but also labourers and domestic workers. The members of these groups save money from their household savings and contribute to a fund from which they draw large amounts to start micro-businesses. Sarita tells us that there is a social organization called CYSD who helps women to start these groups, and they have a meeting on the 5th of every month. The group I show in my video was the first to start in my village, says Sarita. I can say that all the women who are a part of these groups, who are active members have been helped a lot. Especially for things like education and marriages and purchase of land. The advantage is that we can borrow money from our microfinance group at a lower interest. The money-lenders would charge around 5-10%, and now we have to pay only 2. As in our Community Correspondent Rohini's video on a microfinance group in Walhe village in Maharashtra, the women in Sarita's video have been empowered similarly. Not only have they been able to become self-sufficient, they have also found a social circle and a support group. Furthermore, they are now freer to move around outside their houses and learn about savings and investment, things which would have been unimaginable earlier. Sarita says that at first it was mostly women who participated but now the men have started joining as well. It's a real achievement, she said.

Not too much. kind of depends upon what you like. And the other thing is I'm always careful with the garlic, not to get it in too early, because you don't want it to brown up. You don't want to have that overpowering flavor of garlic that's overcooked. We are going to put a little bit of pepper flakes in here. And that, of course, is to your case.

That's the next thing, is that I will be able to continue to support the low budget world and work in it. And also be someone of financial substance. Excellent, excellent. Speaking of low budget, how was your work with Go-Boy Films and on stage? I don't know maybe. You can have it. I'll take it. I'll take care of it. This is a sacrifice building. I really like both these guys a lot. I feel very close to Eric. He's a man of his own. Now he's a grown boy. He's my boy. And yet Lloyd, Madame, and who's in the movie as well. amazing person and supporter and good hearts and that just goes so far with me. I mean I just meet so many people that have no heart or a black heart let's say like you for instance. But he's just like such a good person inside and out I always hope to have in my life. Absolutely. We all need a little bit of extra butts in our life. Is that the right way to say that? Is that grammatically? We need lots of butts. Yes, there we go. That's better. Well, do you have a website that you'd like to plug out there? Debbie Moshondi. Excellent. Well, this has been Ryan Buckley, and see you guys later. Thank you. Thank you."

What they say is that our schools have become places that teach testing. They teach you how to test. They don't teach you how to learn. Teachers teach to test because the principals tell them to do just that because if the kids fail the test, the principal then loses his or her job. The principal pressures the teachers. The teachers pressure the kids and the kids cram for the tests, math and reading exclusively. is now maybe a couple of 15 minutes a week. So today the president unveiled a new plan here to talk about it with me as CNN's education contributor, Steve Perry. Steve, good to see you again. Is this the problem, the standardized testing where it's become more about testing than about learning? No, because the standardized tests are simply taking the entire time to get to the point where they're not information that the boards of education and the state boards of education have determined are necessary for children to know and be able to do. So they're saying that by a certain age or grade, the child should be able to complete certain tasks. And to test that, they have to assign tests. Is a standardized test the only way to measure that? It is not. But to throw the test away to say there's something inherently wrong with testing would mean that we should also look at the LSAT and we should also look at the BOMR examination because these are also standardized examinations. We all grew up with a number two pencils and filling in those little bubbles. So we've all been tested. I guess the question is now, are they considering junking all of these tests that they take today because there's too much emphasis on testing and not enough emphasis on other things. And by the way, when we test lately, I see what they do with my kids. It's always about math or reading, never about any of the other subjects. Right. There does need to be a greater emphasis on more subjects. But one of the reasons why there are less subjects being taught is something that you and I have discussed before. It has to do with the fact that many of these subjects are being cut out as seen not to be as valuable as others to make certain budgetary limitations. What we need to focus on is the fact that the standards are set so that we can establish some measure to determine whether or not the schools are in fact effective. Right now we have no other methods of determining whether or not the schools are effective. I don't know why the three point line on the basketball court is where it is, but right now that's where it is. And until such time as it moves, that's where it is. Well, but here's what I don't understand. possible to be able to find out how good a school is without simply determining how good the kids test scores are. Is there any other way of evaluating that? There are other ways we could look at the overall performance of the school. If we looked at attendance, we could look at some affective measures. We could ask children how happy they are. Those are other informal methods that we could use that are softer. But the truth is, in the end, a school's job is to teach a child to read, write, and compute. And we need to be able to determine, through standardization of information, that the children can in fact meet those standards as they've been set by the public educators who have determined that this is what children in public schools need to be able to know and do. Well here's another thing the Obama administration is going to do. They're going to allow states on their own to decide for themselves what some of the curriculum needs to be and their own processes for evaluating the students. States will do it. They won't be managed. by the feds. So Texas's Board of Education has jumped in now and they've revamped their social studies curriculum and some folks are saying they may have gone too far. Here's what they're doing. They're stressing the superiority of American capitalism, questioning the Founding Fathers commitment to a purely secular government by saying it really is. There really was no division of, no separation of church and state. And they're presenting Republican philosophical philosophies in a much more more positive light. Um, this is interesting. It's almost taking a political turn on how kids are taught in one particular state. What do you make of this? What troubles me most, honestly, Rick, is that textbooks are so 2000. At a time when we're children are using kindles and computers on a regular basis. The fact that any school district thinks that their students should be learning almost exclusively from textbooks, regardless of what's in them, because history is always told by the victors. So what should happen is that we should be presenting competing interests and different forms of information so that children can in fact prove that they can think and take information and put it together much like you and I have to do on a daily basis. This is what life is really about and this is what their life after high school and college will be about so we need to be preparing them for a greater experience not just the one in the classroom so when we're focusing so much on textbook that really is what troubles me. But are you okay with the fact that they want to make sure kids aren't taught evolution? Board members have been locked in an ideological battle between the block of conservatives who questioned Darwin's theory of evolution and believe the founding fathers were all guided by Christian principles. In some cases, they seem to be lessening the impact of Thomas Jefferson because Thomas Jefferson said he wanted to have a wall of separation between the church and the state. I mean, is this about ideology or teaching? No, it is clearly preaching. And this is where an opportunity we're presented with an opportunity to look at what school choice could really me. If school choice were in place, then the children could decide, or the families could decide whether or not they want to send a child to that type of school. The one size fits all public school model is what's failing us. No, I don't agree with these philosophies. I mean, whether or not Thomas Jefferson was a cat or a revolutionary, that's not for me to decide as it relates to this particular community's commitment to education. What I'm saying is what is going far enough? So for instance, if I'm an African-American, have they truly covered the African-American experience? If someone's Latino, have Texas in particular, which obviously has had a large Latino influence Latino board members and others tried to include Latino figures as role models for the state's large Hispanic population By putting it in the curriculum so kids in Texas would learn about Hispanics. They were defeated Apparently one member said the following they're going overboard. They're not experts. They're not historians She said they're rewriting history not only of Texas But of the United States in the world. So that's one of the issues that they're coming up with there as well the representation of minorities in the state of Texas We're out of time Steve. I gotta let you go. All right, as you know, we'll have you back. Here's what else we're falling.

Could you explain a little bit of the history on this? This is a unique situation for the town. Back in 1905, the town received a report from the New Hampshire Insurance Underwriters and they suggested to lower insurance rates for the community. They needed to formalize a department legally, have a formalized fire department, and two, to build stations to serve the citizens. By doing that, the insurance underwriters gave the town both funding to build the and also when they were completed and had the apparatus also lowered their insurance rates. So they gave them a very good incentive to do this. This station we currently have here was one of the first built. And this part of the community was actually one of the most densely populated part of the town. And how this was built is actually a senator who was from Salem at the time, very powerful named Wallace Cole, actually donated the property, donated the labor and materials and built this station for the town back then so they could actually build the second Is there anything inside this building? Is it being used? his father back in the nineteen hundred used to go around deliver meat to the area on it with a horse drawn wagon would come to meet in the back of the thing and give it to him and get paid when they had a fire from this area the people from this station would run out and try to find Mr. Merrill he would bring his horses volunteers just like he was and would hook up the wagons fire trucks basically back then they were horse drawn wagons and would take him out to the fire call and deal with the issue down there so it really was a a neighbor helping neighbor type of event. To talk about the museum part of it what would you think you'd have as a out of that museum. them that history and also be able to have it as a function hall. Invite people in and see some of our history or culture. A lot of some of the artifacts right now if you want to see the old fire helmets and some of the badges and stuff is currently located at the the Salem Museum. So you can see some of the exhibits for those that goes back there. So we want to make it as a very big friendly, be part of the common here, user friendly, let people come in and see some of our history. Alright Mike, now this is the sovereign bank of course, but there used to be a holes house here, right? Yes, this is a 1905. This is a location where the the town of New Hampshire was actually got funding from the New Hampshire Underwriters Association to build host house one. And actually it didn't cost the town anything. We were actually given funds to do that. As we were previously at the host house two, which was donated by Senator Cole, that didn't cost the town anything. This was identical type of station here built wooden two bay station that housed basically horse drawn apparatus. The other interesting thing about this location is that served the community very fine until like the 1930s. 1934 around the We got our first big motorized apparatus and wouldn't fit into hose house one here So that station was taken down and on the same spot a brick classic historical brick 2-bay fire station was built here And it was now be able to house and motor motorized fire apparatus. There's also housed our first full-time chief at the time Which was Chip Herbert Hebert. I'm sorry and he served very first time was a full-time chief He did very much inspections and that type of thing and that type of thing this station served the community very well until the sixties when we the sale and fire department away from actually was offer from Goundry's Funer home and across the street diagonally w central station in the e now this was the main st at the time of station. I s really host house one in the serve the community well gathering point. They cover out towards the North Salem area a little bit. It covered out towards the west part where the Hose House 2 was. But this is served at and then when actually this station was built and changed over in the 30s, Hose House 2 was deconcommissioned in this one. So we actually had one station which was Tube A Brick which had motorized apparatus and that was the primary station in the community. And we also had a second station which was up in North Salem which is now being replaced today with a new station. So that one was open in 1910. Now currently we're at the Main Street Station This is one of the two main street. It serves currently a multi-function. One, it serves as an office administration where Chief Barnes, Assistant Chief Breen, Deputy Chief Parisi, myself, and also Prevention houses the top part of the station. Downstairs we have operationally our shift commander, the captain works out of the station, our paramedic, who is a multi-functional company, works out of the station, an ambulance company, an engine company works out of the station. We also use this station as the EOC, which with the flooding and all that type of and all the other stuff were affected on natural man-made disasters and the back part of it serves as our EOC. So when this was originally built in 1962, they probably never thought that they'll have full-time firefighters sleeping around the clock. They'll have an EOC here, our communications, our paramedics, those type of things. To meet the needs in 1980, in the middle of the 80s, we actually had the ability to add onto the station, which put a whole second floor on top of this, which now houses administration offices, and also houses sleeping quarters for firefighters. Today the fire department is very different and what I mean by that is when we originally hired you talked to the prior generations to us they were hired as firefighters. They were strictly, were on fire incidences were up, alternate means of heating, wood stoves, oil, salamander heating were then and fires were very prevalent. Today a firefighter is not just a firefighter. To be a firefighter, say on today you have to be an EMT, you have to be able to serve on the ambulance, those type of things. You also have to have the firefighter background, But I'm looking at overall things, this firefighting today is 20% of our job. 80% of our job is customer service. We deal with anything from flooding to flooding basements to oil burner problems to wires downs to electrical emergencies to the EMT, the paramedic, the car accident. So we're now basically a jack of all trades. We're into customer service and being able to deliver services second to none in our community. And our firefighters today take a lot of pride in that they're out there. is a camaraderie. It has to be team work and honor for this to work. I would imagine. Absolutely. Our firefighters today, they live together, they train together. And the firefighters today that are going out the door, they're on the job for 25, 27 years. And they're in the ages of the middle 40s to early 50s. If you look at that realistically, they spend more than half their life in the fire department serving the town. So that means a lot of these guys have spent more time with the guys they work with than their families have been married for 20 years and that type of thing. So that's where the brotherhood gets together and bonding together. And as we talked about early in 1905, you know, it was neighbor helping neighbor and that still is embodied and embraced by a firefighters today. They're in here and want to help and make a difference. We're lucky. The fire service today is one of the few departments and organizations in any town that when people call, we have a capability to make a positive impact in their, in their lives and their relationships with people and those type of things. Without paramount today, what they are able to do in the streets and the technology they can do really increases the survivability of the residents of who use our services and that's important. That's a big change from what we did before. We used to be able to go in the field with the EMS and be able to stabilize patients and not let it get worse. Today we actively go all in treat patients and get them better before they get to the hospital and that's important. That's a big change out there.","Okay, Meg, we're at Foals House 2.

You also have to have the firefighter background, But I'm looking at overall things, this firefighting today is 20% of our job. 80% of our job is customer service. We deal with anything from flooding to flooding basements to oil burner problems to wires downs to electrical emergencies to the EMT, the paramedic, the car accident. So we're now basically a jack of all trades. We're into customer service and being able to deliver services second to none in our community. And our firefighters today take a lot of pride in that they're out there. is a camaraderie. It has to be team work and honor for this to work. I would imagine. Absolutely. Our firefighters today, they live together, they train together and the firefighters today that are going out the door, they're on the job for 25, 27 years and they're in the ages of the middle 40s to early 50s. If you look at that realistically, they spend more than half their life in the fire department serving the town. So that means a lot of these guys have spent more time with the guys they work with than their families that have been married for 20 years and that type of thing. So that's where the brotherhood gets together and bonding together. And as we talked about early in 1905, you know, it was neighbor helping neighbor and that still is embodied and embraced by a firefighters today. They're in here and want to help and make a difference. We're lucky. The fire service today is one of the few departments and organizations in any town that when people call, we have a capability to make a positive impact in their lives and their relationships with people and those type of things. Without paramount today, what they are able to do in the streets and the technology they can do really increases the survivability of the residents of who use our services and that's important. That's a big change from what we did before. We used to be able to go in the field with the EMS and be able to stabilize patients and not let it get worse. Today we actively go all in treat patients and get them better before they get to the hospital and that's important. That's a big change out there."

I knew this story was good when I saw it on the little rubber saying, late, it does things completely impossible and this is not an interesting part. This Chinese decided to pull a plane for 5 meters, it was not funny enough. That's the challenge. So this animal caught the poor plane's attention, And they decided to pull the plane out of the air for 5 meters. What would someone do? So this man, 50 years old, decided to pull this plane out of the air. And I hated this guy, I never won a discussion. I pulled the plane out of the air. Sorry, I'm sorry, I can't do it. I can't do it. But it's like... No, man, if you have M's, it's like if X2 and M2 are equal, then it's gonna be a fucking nonsense. I pulled an airplane with the powder. It's over, I lost again. I'm not sure if you're right. He pulled an airplane with the powder and he's right. You lost. Guys, I just had to say something, but I have something to say to you. I'm trying to make a exchange. I've been with about 21,000 exhibitions, about 100... I forgot. I like to see comments, videos, videos, videos, I want to make a video with you guys I want you to tell me what you do, put the video on the video, I want to make a song, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys, I want to make a video with you guys I will leave a number of subscribers, of the number of views that we get in this number I will do what you asked me to do.

The mascara was ""Maybelline the Colossal Volum'"".","Loss, Memory, Glitter, Pink, Easter",11,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/awsn-CUPbQU.mp3,"Hey guys, I'm doing my March favorites video and I know it was like a week but you know better late than never and It's kind of like a few beauty products to show you if you can even call them that and Then like I'll just do like my other favorites like favorite food favorite Movie, you know all my favorites And I will start with my beauty products The first one is a lip gloss and it looks here. I have a really crappy camera. Sorry it Anyways, that's about the shade of it. I really like it and I got it Sorry pop up on my screen. I got it from Target and I was looking for like my my usual lip gloss that I usually get like I have a usual brand and and that one's like, I think it's... the name escapes me right now but when I will... I will... Google it and post it below what I usually get and then I don't even know if they still make it but that's like my favorite one I think they have it... I'm just gonna stop talking about that one because it doesn't even matter but I will tell you what it is when I Google it and put it in the link below the one that I've been liking lately and replacement to that they're called the brand is like it's cover girl and then the like line is called wet slicks and the one that I got was very splash and they're all like they're they're like fruit spritzer so it's all like fruit flavored which I usually don't like I don't know why but for every reason I don't I like like when it isn't sent it because sometimes it if it if it gets in your mouth it I really like that one and it smells good. Very good. Next one I have is mascara. I bet a lot of you use this one or a good handful of you do. I think I've used it before. I really like this Maybelline. Maybelline is awesome and their mascara is really good. This one was volumetric. I like it does a terrible way to describe it but like it doesn't clump your eyelashes and I'm not the greatest at putting on mascara and it doesn't clump your eyelashes in the slightest and it like I've used it quite a few times and like I'll show you the brush the brush is like you know how usually they get all disgusting after a little after a few uses well this one's it's pretty nice it's not too bad so I've had it, I would like to say for like almost a month so that's not too bad and it's good quality too and last one I have is what I think is a better like you know how cool cream and stuff takes off your mascara well this takes it off so much better and you will be surprised at what it is Vaseline I swear now hear me out it's just regular Vaseline go to the store and get some but it takes your mascara off so much easier and like I'm one who like sleeps with their mascara on because I don't I don't wear any makeup really besides lip gloss and mascara and This like when I wake up in the morning it helps it takes it off and it literally takes about a minute Which I think that's how long it should take if you're only wearing mascara because before when I had the cold cream like I think it was like I forget what it's called but that you know The the regular cold creams that they have at the store like I felt like those were really crappy at taking off the mascara and there would still be some on the next morning when I woke up even if it took it off the night before so I think Vaseline is much better and As far as your beauty products goes, that's it. There hasn't really been any other ones that I like So for my other ones and my favorite like movie It's hard to say because there's a lot I watched a really good one called forever strong. That was a really good movie it like I like types of movies where I'm not really into like the chick flicks that stuff that much which is I don't know I just just not my thing and um So when I'm watching chick flick movies with my friends, it's like yeah that that movie was good the only one that I really like is probably um I'm just having like terrible memorization today or it's it's bad. I can't remember it. I Wish I could you guys it's like the newest one with a chain I'm taking in it. I like his movies a lot and not just because he's hot because they're good and partly because he's cute um But I guess my favorite movie right now would be forever strong and forever I It's amazing. I don't know, it's inspirational. It's based on a true story, not about the guy, but about the team he was on. So if you have Netflix, it's on there. I don't really know how old is it. I think it was made in 2010, but it's really, really good. So go check it out. For music, lately I've really been into a data remember. They're good. I don't really like their screaming stuff that much. I like their softer music. I also like Kid Cudi. He's amazing. I don't really get on the bandwagon that quick for new artists unless I find them really really good. Because I'm listening to whoever was out two years before. So I didn't really take a chance to listen to Kid Cudi until like a month ago. When I heard him I was like wow, not a month ago. Maybe a little bit earlier than that. I really got into his music a while ago and he's good. He tops all. I love it. I also like Kanye West lately. I like his song Otis. That's a really good song. It's catchy and it will get stuck in your head and you'll want to listen to it again. But it's good. Kind of reminds me of CeeLo Green a little bit who I also used to be obsessed with. And Neon Hitch. Oh my goodness. Her music is so good. I'm reading about a fictional character. Oh, my light is really like bright behind me. I'm gonna need to move it. I tried to sit in front of it, but it didn't really work. But anyways, go Google neon hitch that is legitimately her actual name. And she was like a circus when she was 10. 10. And she grew up in London, which is a cool place. Gotta say. Anyways, those are all my favorite favorites I don't really have any more to tell you about and if I do well I will tell you in my next video happy Easter and have a wonderful weekend bye","Hey guys, I'm doing my March favorites video and I know it was like a week but you know better late than never and It's kind of like a few beauty products to show you if you can even call them that and Then like I'll just do like my other favorites like favorite food favorite Movie, you know all my favorites And I will start with my beauty products The first one is a lip gloss and it looks here.

Well this takes it off so much better and you will be surprised at what it is. Vaseline, I swear. Now hear me out, it's just regular Vaseline, go to the store and get some. mascara off so much easier and like I'm one who like sleeps with their mascara on because I don't I don't wear any makeup really besides lip gloss and mascara and This like when I wake up in the morning it helps it takes it off and it literally takes about a minute Which I think that's how long it should take if you're only wearing mascara because before when I had the cold cream like I think it was like I forget what it's called but that you know The the regular cold creams that they have at the store like I felt like those were really crappy at taking off the mascara and there would still be some on the next morning when I woke up even if it took it off the night before so I think Vaseline is much better and As far as your beauty products goes, that's it.

Because video blogging is definitely the way forward and in videoblog.com you've got the greatest little book to show you how to do it. What I'm going to do right now is just do an example of anything. So I'm going to start with a demonstration. Other things will be pictures from various times back in history that I've taken, just a little portfolio of images. The idea of blogging, of course, is to convey useful information. And in the process of you conveying useful information to encourage people, like yourself, to go to buy the link from the blog, and maybe do a bit of buying something because after all most of the internet is about people buying and selling things. My first little, no not my first but this little moment of my video blog is going to be the simple act of peeling orange. I don't know if you've got a lot of problems. A lot of people will take an orange and they'll stick their things into the skin and do all sorts of things with it to try and get the skin off. Well I'm just going to try and show you in a few easy moments how to cut the skin off of orange, keep the orange whole and then be able to eat the whole orange in a nice, tidy manner. Now I think I can do everything with each of the video, some of our pie like this, so let's go. First of all, I take this knife and I put it around the top of the orange. I don't want to cut too deeply into the orange because all I want to do is be able to lift the lid of the orange. So when I've got around the other side more or less, I can then get into the top of the orange and lift the top of the orange cleanly off the orange. See, I go and when I'm there I try to grab a little middle bit out so that there's a hole here to break the orange up easily. Okay, now we've done that bit, let's go around the sides. You just run the knife right around to the bottom and back up the other side. And we do that at right angles, down the side, right around to the bottom. And then what we've got is an orange ready to be finally peeled. Let's have a look. So if I turn the orange around to you, you can see I can put my finger under that segment, just lift the skin off. And I can do that. This time, let me see how easy the skin comes off. Sorry about that truck, boys. and we lift the last two off and there we have our perfectly peeled orange no sort of broken bits, no nothing and we can just break the orange in half pick out the little bits in the middle here and then our orange is perfectly ready to be eaten either one piece at a time or about a pip and we can go for bigger pieces but we've got a perfect orange all peeled and none of that business of getting stuff under your fingernails It's just a nice clean easy to eat orange. So when you peel your orange a knife round the top round the sides at right angles lifts the segments out Anyway, this is Michael Costello from videocashblog.com and I look forward to talking to you again showing you other things from my hopefully interesting life But just to try and give you ideas on how to use a video blog and make cash out of it in your world But anyway pop over to videocashblog.com pick up the book and...","Hi, I'm Costello here from videocashblog.com Today I just want to quickly introduce a few items of thought provoking material that might give you some idea of what you could put on a video blog.

This second one is my PC decided to download it. I'm not sure if it kind of stopped at the Hebrew Gatherer quite easily. I get the ball with Zirkov and his hair played to Etto, cuts inside, played to Busafah and he, he believes it. And Zirkov can't put it into the open goal. Get the ball back here again, Roberto Carlos, to Busafah, to that guy there. Plays it to Gonzalez, but he cuts it out, managed to. and the shifty pass for the belt of Carlos plays it to eto gets past Coralacini and into the back of the net with Samuel eto nice finish there let's be up one now he gets the ball one two we've been off but gets through and he hits it wide I thought I was into to be honest gets it back to him and Bar has the shot wide again think comedy to work any shooter man gets it back with Bar running down the wing with that pace. If I say that this ESE has the shot, Keeper saves it. And at halftime it's 1-0 to me. Pretty even game. If I do say so myself. And the second half here, Peter Carlos has the shot. ESE for the keeper. Get it back again. Bussafro to Eto. Eto hits the freaking post. God damn it. Anyway, get the ball back again, Pussafa plays it's suit to Etto, one on one, they keep a flex at the pass, don't mind chips at all, sexual pen is there, Etto. Ding, get the ball back again, Zherkov, hold it up to now, trying to get third, just killed the game off, even though it's 90 minute, get the ball back, Etto has a shot, Chrome makes a great serve there, and that's the end of the game. Pretty short video today, we're on my standards, But I just start giving you one game at a time. Means I get out more videos out there. So I've managed to beat FIFA calm month doing it all. Don't think he was very happy with that one. But yeah, that means I get three points. I think I've gone toughly grip after this match. At the end of all the group games I'll show you the table.

It is a pity that the case like the one in PURDA has to be agreed on, so that we, the defenders, can show our own misfortunes to those who are political leaders and those who represent us as defenders. Today, he is called PURDA, and tomorrow, he knows how and who describes him. And Bosnia and Serbia are only doing what is signed with the Croatian agreement. Neither Bosnia nor Serbia are The government has processed over 3000 Croatian defenders and they have not judged them rightfully. They have not ruled Hague to judge our heroes for the blood and blood. They have made it into the Croatian authorities. The authorities, the state for which they were ready to die. After we did not fight for the lives of the government in the war, we had to fight for the existence of the children in the world. Today we are asking for protection and understanding of their names, they cannot appear on one description. We expect from the politicians who have removed every crime and responsibility for themselves. The same politicians who have not risked anything in the creation of this country, sold it to our home and as a nation, they take it in favor of their political or material ambitions. We have been transferred to the state, to the state of the people of the state, unknown judges. We have not thought about this when we have given them the name of the candidate, whether he is in the hands of the leader. We do not let anyone in our house and in front of our children, proud, full and rich, as they are, because there is no question for us We are all for Croatian friends! Croatian for what? The military service of the Croatian defenders, which are forced to be responsible for the construction of the Serbian camp, the political structure of the government of the Republic of Croatia, which is considered a great responsibility for the development of the Croatian defenders, in which, unfortunately, the help of the people of the Croatian bloodline. We are leaving the authorities, not satisfied with the lack of security of the defense, in the time when it is necessary to show the truth about the Home War and the damages we have fought, and who, as if they had lost their way somewhere, have invested their aggressors, so in a few days even the authorities have sent generals, they are breaking through houses, they are reducing the right of the government, they are reaching the far-right enemies with the aggressor and they admit the decision"

Ta nic przede wszystkim leje skrzytę i pozwala nam na poczucie i można się pozwalać, bo w zniszczeniu możemy na pewno w zbicie na wzgórziny odszalej w rzeczywistości i możemy być kąścami. Jestem najmuzyka. Ludzie powiem, że to bardzo jest. Zawsze wierzyć w inni, gdy się nie poddawać, bo wtedy wychodzą na takie mega legalne skrzydła i zmieciemy tych ludzi, którzy nam chcieli je powcieć.","What is your life like? My way of life. I would like to help my life and I would like to help it make sense and apart from my personal values, my personal life as a loving family, it is not just about my life. I'm here, I'm on stage, dancing. I can express all my emotions, everything that's inside me. I'm getting better and better. Now the dance is so obvious to me that I don't know if I can move on to a different stage, in which there is no dance. First of all, I'm a dancer and I can feel the emotions We can be a part of the group, we can be a part of the group, we can be a part of the group. We are the main music.

Esto abre oportunidades de inversión. Esto es traído en diario y nos encontramos aquí con Jonas Preler para que nos cuente cómo y cuándo invertir en esta compañía. Buenas tardes, Jonas. Buenas tardes, Daniela. Bueno, un poco en contexto. Defectivamente, las acciones que eran muy fuertes el 19, cuando se entregaron los resultados, porque definitivamente la compañía ganó cerca de 5 mil millones de dólares durante el trimestre, que parece una de trimestre del 2013 por un quinto trimestre consecutivo que eso está bastante relacionado con lo que hemos hablado y bueno es por lo que ayer informó Apple que siguen las ventas de tablets, son las que están apuntando a la industria. Además Microsoft durante el último trimestre lanzó el último software de la compañía que también no ha tenido los resultados esperados pero también esto un poco los analistas están adelantando que hay que darle tiempo porque generar los software tiene un periodo de introducción más lento pero ya deberían durante el próximo trimestre mostrar ¿Cómo y cuándo podemos invertir en Microsoft? y vemos que ya más en largo plazo la acción se está alejando los 32 dólares uno podría apostar que ésta podría llegar los 26 dólares la acción y eso te da una rentabilidad cercana a un 17% este es para algunos analistas el escenario más probable o lo otro es apostar el arce de la acción que eso ya debería ver si dan algunos datos puntuales o hay alguna entrada de un fondo más importante que tomar posición en torno a los 32 dólares, 32.5 y apostar porque llega a los 36.6 esto te da un upside potencial de un 3.3% Entonces, como estamos viendo, la rentalidad más alta, te la está dando la apuesta a la baja la acción, este es para algunos analistas el escenario más probable puntualmente para Microsoft. Y hasta ahí entonces con los resultados de Microsoft, pero también sabemos que tenemos que estar muy atentos con Facebook, ¿verdad? Si hoy día después del cierre del mercado, como lo hacen las grandes compañías, ayer fue el caso de Apple que los resultados fueron positivos, digamos, para lo que el mercado esperaba, aunque igual se ha visto de esa aceleración, respecto de Facebook, igual va a ser bastante decidor para el mercado, porque esta compañía recordemos que siempre ha sido bien castigado después de su apertura en bolsa, ya, a pesar que se ha arreglarado bastante, llegó a lanzar al casi a la mitad de lo que se había abierto. Hoy día, el promedio de los analistas están apostando que hay una utilidad cerca de 0,14 dólares por acción de Facebook, eso, o sea, 14 centavos de dólares por acción. Si los resultados están por debajo de eso, la acción lo podríamos ver bastante castigada mañana y quizá mañana nos podríamos referir a este tema. Pero también hay que abrir bastante bastante los resultados y que leemos con bastante atención porque ellos se dirían referir bastante a los ingresos publicitarios que ha sido la gran piedra de tope que está teniendo la compañía así que mañana los podrías comentar y si después el mercado hay que estar atento a los resultados de eso. Nos quedamos entonces muy atentos a este trading. Muchas gracias Conas por este comentario. De nada Antónela. Y muchas gracias a ustedes por acompañarnos en esta nueva edición de Trading Diario que tengan muy buenas tardes.","Microsoft's shares exploded more than 10% on Friday after the report of the company's results, which was under the market's expectations. This opens up investment opportunities. This is Trait in Diario and we are here with Jonas Preler, so you can tell us how and when to invest in this company. Good afternoon, Jonas. Good afternoon, Rodernera. Well, in context, indeed the shares fell very strong in the 19th when the results were delivered because the company definitely won about $ 5 billion during the quarter, which seems to be a The technology company is very positive, and they are already earning money. A company like this in the US is also very good for the market. But the problem was that it was very low in the estimated and quite low in the previous trimester, which fell about 18% compared to the previous trimester. This is because it is fundamentally due to the low demand that computers are having, which are one of the great products of Microsoft and what it has sustained a large part of its utilities for the last time. In fact, according to the Garner manufacturer, the Venta PC fell 11% in the second The last three months of 2013, for a fifth consecutive three-month, that is quite related to what we talked about, well, what yesterday Informa Apple, that follow the sales of tablets, are the ones that are aiming at the industry. In addition, Microsoft, during the last three months, launched the last software of the company, which also has not had the expected results, but also this, a little the analysts are advancing that it must be given time, because to generate the software has a period of introduction slower, but they would already be during the next three months, and it will be more solid in this sense, but the action would be more complicated by investors. So, the question remains the same as before, but how and when can we invest in Microsoft? Microsoft has, for the prices that are being reached, and with the fees, with the price of the action, quite marked, according to a recommendation of the investment, two possible investments are being opened. In the case of Microsoft, the action is being reached in $32, and if we bet on a fall, if we see that there is a reversal in the trend, and we see that in the long term the action is being removed from the $ 32, one could bet that this could reach the $ 26 in the action and that gives you a profitability close to 17%. This is for some analysts the most likely scenario. Or the other is to bet on the action that that would already be seen if they give some specific data or there is some more important background input that taking position in the $ 32, $ 32.5 and betting because it reaches the $ 36.6. This gives you an upside potential of a 3.3% So, as we are seeing, the highest profitability, the low-action bet, is for some analysts the most likely scenario for Microsoft. And so far with the results of Microsoft, but we also know that we have to be very attentive with Facebook, right? If today, after the closing of the market, like the big companies do, yesterday it was the apple case that the results were positive, let's say, for what the market expected, although it has been seen a certain desalination, about Facebook, it will be a big deal for the market. Because we always remember that this company has been punished after opening it in a bag. Although it has been recovered a lot, it has reached almost half of what had been opened. Today, the average of analysts is betting that there is a utility of about $ 0.14 per action of Facebook. That is, $ 14 cents per action. If the results are below that, we could see the action punished quite a lot tomorrow and maybe tomorrow we could refer to this topic. But we also have to open up a lot of We are very attentive to this trading, thank you very much for this comment. Thank you very much. And thank you very much for joining us in this new edition of Trading Diary, have a very good afternoon."

NOUVELLES VAGUES,,,1080,1,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/fh4E-1BwoOg.mp3,"Alors, mon projet d'exposition s'intitule La fin de la nuit. Il s'agit de la première partie d'un projet en deux parties. Donc en deux volets, entre Paris et Los Angeles, autour de l'influence visuelle de deux réalisateurs de cinéma expérimentaux. L'un de Los Angeles, Kenneth Hanger, et l'autre français, Henri-Georges Clouseau, pour son film, L'enfer. Et donc, c'est un projet que je réalise en deux parties. Première volet, qui ouvre au Palais de Tokyo, la semaine prochaine. dans cette institution qui s'appelle Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions au mois d'octobre. Donc le premier volet de l'exposition est lié à l'influence esthétique de Kenneth Hanger sur une génération plutôt jeune d'artistes de Los Angeles. C'est la seconde partie autour de l'enfer d'Henri-Jean-Jean-Cluzault et de son influence esthétique et visuelle sur la scène artistique contemporaine française. Alors oui, effectivement c'est un sujet qui est lié au cinéma de l'artiste. et qui interroge les liens à la fois conceptuales et esthétiques entre cinéma expérimental et art contemporain. Par exemple, ce qui m'intéressait chez Kelly Singer, c'est ses recherches purement plastiques, notamment d'expérimentation visuelle, sonore, donc à la fois avec la pellicule, la couleur, la saturation de l'image, mais aussi son rapport à la culture populaire, musicale, artistique de la Californie. Et puis, il y a des thèmes qui sont assez récurrents dans mes recherches tels que le fétichisme des corps et des objets, et aussi les liens de la culture. de mysticisme et de localisation qui sont d'autres thèmes que je développe. En tant que de média, le cinéma et l'image animé m'a toujours intéressé. Moi, j'ai commencé à travailler aux États-Unis, à New York, notamment au département média et performance du Moma. J'ai beaucoup travaillé sur les collections contemporaines de vidéos et de films du Moma. Et j'ai ensuite persévéré un petit peu dans ce domaine-là, mais pas uniquement. Je travaille pas uniquement avec des réalisateurs ou des vidéastes. En revanche, j'ai récentré Le paysage artistique actuel, un Alors, pas que les singeurs ou vichingueurs, mais des jeunes artistes américains, Californiens, qu'on ne montrera pas forcément souvent. Donc ça, ça m'intéressait. J'avais aussi un petit peu envie de réfléchir à la composition d'une exposition d'un point de vue spatial. J'ai travaillé avec une scénographe, une disigneuse d'exposition, comme on dit, qui vit à Berlin. Et on a vraiment construit un imaginaire mystique occulte avec deux grandes colonnes à l'entrée, une structure pentagramique. qui rappelle un petit peu toute l'imagerie occulte propre à Kenesinger. Voilà, donc j'ai un peu travaillé aussi sur l'architecture d'exposition. Donc ça, je pense que ce sont des choses, des questions qu'on se pose en tant que jeune commissaire d'exposition. Et j'avais aussi envie de confronter les générations d'artistes, donc d'avoir une position historique et des positions plus contemporaines. Oui, alors, bon, effectivement, moi, j'ai grandi à Paris, en région parisienne, donc je suis beaucoup allée au Palais de Tokyo. C'était une exposition assez intéressante, très sombre, qui posait un certain nombre de questions qui m'ont beaucoup intéressé. En fait, plus tard, quand je travaillais au Nume Museum pendant deux ans, nous avons sur la rétrospective de Brian Geisen. En fait, j'ai compris que de Sound Mine, c'était lié à la relation quand il était en train de faire des films, et avec William Barouf. En développant ce projet de recherche, j'ai compris que l'exposition de Gorandine-Honay avait un peu semé dans ma manière de voir l'art contemporain. J'avais beaucoup apprécié la carte blanche, laissée à Jeremy Deller, quelques années. Je reviens de Venise, comme beaucoup d'entre nous. Il a produit un très beau pavillon anglais. Après, c'est un peu compliqué. Je pense que, en tant que jeune commissaire d'exposition, l'institution importante donc le momma, le pompidou, le new museum. Je m'inscrite malgré tout maintenant dans une pratique très anti-institutionnelle puisque je suis commissaire indépendante. Donc je dois dire que probablement ce que j'ai vu au Palais de Tokyo, ma nourrie mais peut-être ma nourrie en défaut, en négatif. C'est-à-dire que je me suis dit que tout ce que j'ai vu dans les musées en grandissant, c'est pas du tout ce que j'ai envie de faire aujourd'hui. Et je pense qu'on est beaucoup probablement de commissaire invité dans cette saison qui est un petit peu travail à la marge de l'institution. C'est pour ça qu'on a pris ce choix, qu'on a fait ce choix d'être indépendante. et de n'en pas être embauchés par des musées.","My project is entitled The End of the Night. It's the first part of a two-part project, in two flights between Paris and Los Angeles, around the visual influence of two film directors, one of Los Angeles, Kenos Hanger, and the other Frenchman, Henri-George Clouseau, for his film, The Hell. So it's a project I'm doing in two parts, the first flight that opens in the Tokyo Palace next week, and the second part, The first exhibition is linked to the aesthetic influence of Kenneth Hanger on a younger generation of artists from Los Angeles. The second is about the Hell in the Clouse of Enri-Jean-Je-Cluzot and its aesthetic and visual influence on contemporary French art scene. and the movement. And which interroges the links, both conceptually and aesthetically, between experimental and contemporary cinema. For example, what interests me at K.L. Singer is its purely plastic research, including visual, sound experiments, both with film, color, image saturation, but also its relationship to the popular culture, musical, artistic of California. And then there are themes that are quite recurrent in my research, such as the fetishism of bodies and objects, and also the and the mysticism and locultism that I develop. As a media, cinema and animation industry always interested me, I started working in the United States, in New York, especially in the media and performance departments of the moment. I worked on contemporary video and film collections of the moment. I then persevered in this field, but not only that. I worked with directors or video artists. The film is a film programme called Fatish and Figure, which is about the theme I'm developing in this exhibition, which was shown here in the Tokyo Palace, but also in Brussels. It will soon be in Norway, the United States, Los Angeles. There are links between the components of this exhibition and my practice of curator. The current artistic landscape, I would say that there are several different types of art, I think that we can't look at contemporary art from a monolithic point of view. There are certainly different approaches. I think in terms of internationalisation, of practices, especially curatorial, since I myself am French, but I have lived in the United States for a long time. This is where I mainly worked, in New York and in Los Angeles, but also in Europe, elsewhere. I was interested in showing artists in Paris that we don't show very often. I was interested in the composition of a space exhibition. I worked with a designer who lives in Berlin. We built a mystical, occult image with two large columns at the entrance, a pentagramic structure. which reminds me of the occult imagery of Kenes Hanger himself. I also worked on the exhibition architecture. I think these are questions we ask ourselves as the young exhibition commissary. I also wanted to confront the generations of artists to have a more contemporary historical position. I grew up in Paris, in the Paris region, so I went to the Tokyo Palace a lot. I think I always remember the exhibition of the third mine, which was organized by Hugo Randidone a few years ago, when Marc-Olivier Waller was director here. It was an interesting exhibition, very dark, which asked a lot of questions that interested me. Later, when I was working at the New Museum for two years, we were on the retrospective of Brian Geisen. I understood that the third mine was linked to the relationship between Brian Geisen and William Barouf. I'm a very anti-institutional practice, because I'm an independent commissioner. Probably what I saw in the Tokyo Palace is a minority, but maybe a minority in the negative. I saw everything in museums in the Grand Dissent, that's not what I want to do today. I think we're very much in charge of the committee in this season, which is a little bit of work in the course of the institution. That's why we made this choice to be independent. and not to be enraged by museums."

The T-90 and the Opardo 2A6 have never been faced in open combat but experts have simulated such a situation. With mathematical methods the results of a supposed confrontation between German tanks and 10 Russian armored vehicles were revealed. As the data was obtained the Opardo would not be able to get close to the T-90 nor even to the shooting distance. The Russian model has a and 140 million rubles, that is, four times and half more expensive than the T-90. By spending the same sum, Russia can acquire four national blinds or a foreign tank, but being the correlation in combat from 1 to 4, the Oparto has no chance of triumph over the T-90."

All three funeral will be Sunday at 10 a.m. How do you feel about this whole situation, Izmini? Well, it's very heartbreaking. There's been so much tragedy in our families, starting with Oedipus. There was a great curse on him and because of it, my grandmother killed herself. I'm missing my two brothers, my sister and my aunt. Yes, it's terrible for me too. I can hardly take the cruise. Now that we have heard this terrible tale, let's play in our morning with Sunny Days. It is currently 64 degrees Fahrenheit and partly cloudy. Tonight there will be a low of 55 degrees Fahrenheit and the skies will be clear. There's no rain in the forecast for this week, so the weather will be enjoyable. Now let's get back to the newsroom. Hello, I am Julio here with your sports update. The Olympic Games will start up again this week. The first day will include ceremonial sacrifices to the gods.

Je suis oftalmologiste. Je viens du Niger. Donc, dans mon pays, je suis le coordonnateur du programme national de lutte contre l'assisté. Et en même temps, je suis enseignant à la faculté et des sciences de la santé, donc à l'université. Parce que nous sommes très peu nombreux au drama. Et l'OPC, donc, organisation pour la prévention de l'assisté, est un partenaire que nous avons rencontré depuis de longues dates. Nous étions à la fac, nous avons des contacts avec l'OPC par certains documents que nous recevions à l'époque, nous étions à l'Institut d'Octalmologie Tropicale de l'Afrique Lyota de Bamako où nous avions fait notre formation de CES d'Octalmologie et nous recevions certains documents de l'OPC. Quand nous avions fini, nous avons terminé, nous étions sur les terrains. Moi, j'étais particulièrement affecté à 1000 km de la capitale où j'étais seul au Octalmologie dans une région qui couvrait une population de plus de 1 million d'habitants. Dans cette région, je vous assure que l'OPC m'a permis de travailler dans de bonnes conditions. Pourquoi ? Parce que l'OPC m'a envoyé du matériel, du matériel, d'examens. Donc j'avais reçu, je ne dis pas une lampe affante, j'avais reçu un javel, j'avais reçu une boîte à vert d'essai, j'avais reçu des hennophitaloscopes et surtout des consommables, car quand vous êtes en zone isolée comme ça, ne serait-ce que le colire à la fleur de saïne, la novézine, ce sont des colires d'examins qui vont vous permettre d'examiner vos malades quand vous ne les avez pas, vous ne pouvez pas travailler. Et ça, le PC me les envoyait régulièrement. Et aussi des produits, des antibiotiques, des colires, des pomades que je pouvais donner à mes malades, ce qui me facilité le travail et qui rendait l'atmosphère agréable pour moi pendant tous les 6 jours où je suis resté. et après notre collaboration a continué avec l'OPC. Dans le domaine quand je suis arrivé au niveau de la capitale, nous avions continué dans la collaboration. L'OPC nous a aidé dans la formation des techniciens supérieurs à nos phatalmologies avec le lion's club, la fondation lion's club international qui a financé. Donc l'OPC est venu nous aider pour mettre en place une filière de formation des techniques supérieures à nos phatalmologies avec tout le matériel pédagogique. Actuellement, c'est avec ce matériel que nous travaillons. Il y a déjà eu deux promotions qui sont sorties et il y a eu des ateliers aussi de formation pédagogique pour permettre aux enseignants, dans la formation des techniques, permettre aux enseignants de mieux transmettre les connaissances auprès des étudiants. Il y a eu aussi un autre atelier dans la recherche, la méthodologie de la recherche. parce que dans le cadre de l'université, ces enseignants qui font beaucoup de travail ont besoin quand même de savoir comment écrire, faire des publications. Et ça encore, l'OPC nous a aidés pour faire un atelier à l'intention de ces enseignants. Et actuellement, je vous assure que c'est vraiment avec la collaboration l'aide toute l'assistance de l'OPC que cette formation se passe. Nous avons prévu d'autres formations à l'intention toujours des enseignants et même du personnel. pour le moment nous attendons parce que je pense qu'il y a quelques difficultés dans les financements de ces activités. Mais vraiment je vous assure que pour nous l'OPC est un grand partenaire parce que moi personnellement j'ai été beaucoup aidé par l'OPC jusqu'à ce jour.","I am Dr. Hamza Aboudou. I am an ophthalmologist. I come from Nigeria. In my country, I am the coordinator of the National Routes Against Assisted Programme. At the same time, I am a teacher at the Faculty of Science and Health at the University because we are very few in the drama. The OPC, so the Organization for Assisted Prevention, is a partner that we have met since long time ago. We were at the FAC, we had contacts with the OPC, through some documents that we received at the time, we were at the Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology in Africa, Lyotha, in Bamako, where we had done our training, so, of OPC-S, of ophthalmology, and we received some documents from the OPC. And when we had finished, we had finished, we were on the ground. I was particularly affected by a thousand kilometers of the capital, where I was alone, in a region that would cover a population of over 1 million people. In this region, I assure you that the PC allowed me to work in good conditions. Why? Because the PC sent me materials, exam materials. So I received, I don't say a lamp, I received a javel, I received a glass of water, I received a n-o-ftal-moscope, and above all, consumables. Because when you are in an isolated area like this, the anger in the retina, the new disease, are the anger of exams. They will allow you to examine your disease. When you don't have them, you can't work. And this, the PC sends them regularly. And also products, antibiotics, anger, pomades that I can give to my sick people, which really facilitates my work and makes the atmosphere pleasant for me during all these days where I stayed. After that, our collaboration continued with the OPC. When I arrived at the capital, we continued in collaboration. The OPC helped us in the formation of higher technologies in our technology. With the UNSCLUB, the International UNSCLUB Foundation, who financed the OPC and came to help us to put in place a branch of higher education in ophthalmology with all the pedagogical material. Currently, it is with this material that we work on. There have already been two promotions that have been released and there have also been pedagogical training workshops to allow teachers in the technical training to better transmit knowledge to students. There has also been another workshop in the research, the methodology of research. because in the university, these teachers who do a lot of work, need to know how to write and publish. And this, the OPC helped us to make a natural effort to the intention of these teachers. And currently, I assure you that it is really with collaboration, help, all the assistance of the OPC that this training is going on. We have provided other training, the intention of teachers and even staff, We are waiting for the moment because I think there are some difficulties in financing these activities. But I assure you that for us, the OPC is a great partner because I personally have been helped a lot by the OPC until today."

La dette grecque est une éraflure financière qui s'est infectée parce qu'elle a été très mal soignée au premier chef par l'Allemagne et la France et par les institutions européennes qui ont multiplié les emplattres. Alors les marchés n'ont pas toujours raison mais en l'occurrence ils ont raison de dire que la dette grecque ne sera jamais remboursée en totalité, que les banques européennes sont très fragiles et surtout que les leaders européens vont avoir beaucoup de mal à se mettre d'accord sur une solution. Alors vu la manière dont ça se passe ils ont raison tout le monde connaît grosso modo la solution. Elle est politique, celle, fédéralisme, budgétaire, les euroobligations et une union économique renforcée. Tout le monde serait d'accord, ce serait déjà un sacré chantier, mais seulement voilà les opinions publiques qui sont hostiles, des majorités sont en porte à fous ou en campagne. Voilà pourquoi il n'y a toujours pas de pilote politique dans l'avion. Ce n'est pas un peu la faute en guéramercée. Elle y a sa part, mais sa majorité parlementaire est hostile à tout nouvel engagement européen. Les deux alliés de la CDEU, le parti de la chancellière la css ou bavaroise et les libéraux sont favorables à l'abandon de la graisse la majorité au pouvoir se déchire au point qu'on assistera peut-être un renversement d'alliance les verts et le spd venant au secours de la chancellière pour appuyer des solutions disons plutôt fédérales la chancellière serait prête en effet à s'engager cette semaine dit-on en faveur des euro bonds il ne faut pas croire que la france va échapper elle aux violences de ce débat Il sera pire qu'en Allemagne d'autant que Nicolas Sarkozy se refuse à confier quoi que ce soit du budget français à des institutions européennes comme le préconiserait les Allemands et que la gorge on le sait est très divisée sur sujets. Nous aurons donc la campagne pour le traité de Maastricht au carré enchassé dans la campagne présidentielle qui va devoir se transformer en école de pilotage européenne. Votre carnet de notes c'est un 0 sur 20 Michel Mercier qui le garde des sauts le ministre de la Justice. pas ce que vous venez de dire. Michel Mercier le garde des Sceaux qui en général se fait remarquer parce qu'il garde toujours le silence alors de par sa fonction il pourrait en effet exiger de la justice qu'elle ouvre une information sur les déclarations tony truant de l'avocat Robert Bourgi sur la France afrique. Au dernier nouvel le ministre serait caché dans les sous-soldats chanceller.","We will come back to the economy with you, Sir Julie. Good evening. Good evening Christophe. Yes, according to the Elysée, there will be no, we were talking about rumors, with a certain clip earlier, there will be no French initiative today and yet the rumor has run all day that there will be one. Even tonality in Germany, so in this crisis, according to you, is there a pilot in the plane? So we are looking, let's hear it well. Greece only represents 3% of the European GDP, while the European Union is the first economic zone. At the beginning, The Greek debt is a financial error that was infected because it was badly treated by the German and French prime ministers and by European institutions that multiplied the emplacements. So the markets are not always right but in this case they are right to say that the Greek debt will never be reimbursed in total, that the European banks are very fragile and especially that the European leaders will have a lot of trouble agreeing on a solution. So, given the way it is happening, they are right. We know how the solution is political, self-federalism, budgetary, euro-obligations and an economic union. Everyone will agree that it would be a bloody sample, but only here are the public opinions that are hostile, majorities are in a crazy mood or in a campaign. That's why there is still no political pilot in the plane. It's not a bit of a mistake that he has marked. There is his part, but his parliamentary majority is hostile to any new European commitment. The two allies of the CDU The part of the Chancellor, the C.S.U., Bavaroise and the Liberals are favorable to the abandonment of Greece. The majority of the power is at the point that we will perhaps assist in a reverse of the alliance. The green and the SPD, coming to the support of the Chancellor to support solutions, rather, rather, federal. The Chancellor would be ready to engage in this week, let's say, in favor of the Eurobonds. We must not believe that France will escape the violence of this debate. It will be worse if Germany, as much as Nicolas Sarkozy, refuses to trust any French budget to European institutions like the one the Germans would prefer, and that the Ganges, we know, is very divided on the subject. We will have the campaign for the Maastricht-Aucaré treaty, in the presidential campaign, which will have to be transformed into a European pilot school. Your note, it's a 0-20, Michel Mercier, who is the Minister of Justice. Michel Mercier, the leader of the SAU, is always silent. He could demand justice, and he would provide information on the statements of the lawyer Robert Bourgy on France-African."

For my famous therapist paper, I did mine on Carl Jung, or possibly Carl Jung. Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology. He was best known for his theories of the collective unconsciousness, including the concepts of archetypes and the use of synchronicity in psychotherapy. Along with Sigmund Freud, Jung pioneered modern theories of the relationships between the conscious and unconscious aspects of the mind. But while Freud mainly hypothesized a psychosexual explanation for human behavior, Jung perceived the primary motivating force to be spiritual in origin. According to Jung, it was from the soul that the complementary drives of differentiation and integration arose, fueling the processes of growth, development, and healing. Mental illness arose when these processes were thronged in influential and In a variety of disciplines from theology to art to atomic physics, Carl Jung is considered, along with Freud and Alfred Adler, to be one of the principal founding fathers of modern psychology. In addition to producing his theory of the collective unconsciousness, Jung's work fueled the development of both word association tests and the Myers-Briggs personality tests. Carl Gustav Jung was born, July 26, 1860. in 1975 in the Swiss village of Kesswell near Lake Constance. His interests in spiritual principles and mythologies, both Eastern and Western, was given in an early age boosted by family encouragement and example. Young's father began tutoring him in an early age in Latin and other subjects and was himself a classical scholar, an orientalist and a pastor. A number of young's uncles were also and his maternal grandfather was a distinguished theologian and hebrist. Carl Young's dedication to study was somewhat slow in developing. After sustaining a head injury, which incurred a fainting spelt which required him to stay home long periods from school, he became so disgusted with himself, well basically after he heard his father saying he was afraid of what the young child's future would be, He managed to overcome both the physical handicap and his lazy habits to become a promising young scholar. So even though he started out as a shaky scholar, he turned himself around. But this transition, remarkable on its own, was marked by a peculiar incident that served to awaken young's interest in the nature of mind and in paranormal phenomena. One day, while he was walking home from school, he experienced himself suddenly coming out of a profound mental fall. He felt as if he was finally himself again. But more remarkably than that, he also felt that he was simultaneously the 12-year-old Carl Jung and also a wise old man who had previously lived in the 1700s. So this was kind of like a stepping point or jumping off the start for the young Carl Jung. In college, his curiosity of such phenomenon led him to conduct considerable research the skeptical results of which formed the basis of his doctoral thesis. Although Young concluded that many self-proclaimed trans-mediums were really channeling some kind of repressed psychological disturbances, he would later state that there was a belief that some psychic phenomenon, particular telepathy, was genuine. Young began to formulate a new theory of the workings of the unconscious mind that would prove remarkably similar to that being simultaneously worked by Sigmund Freud. Young's theories were but one of the whole new psychology, uniquely his own in which the psyche was viewed as a dynamic growth-oriented entity poised between two powerful and complementary drives, the drive to learn and incorporate new perspectives, and equally important drive to create a coherent, harmonious integration of all the inner aspects of the self. concept would form the foundation of much of Young's later work and his theory. When Young published the results and interpretation of his early work in the psychology of dementia, he drew the attention of Sigmund Freud, who was fascinated by the parallels between Young's theory of the unconsciousness and his own. The pair struck up a correspondence and eventually became close personal and working relationship, and Freud, older by some 20 years than Young, took on a mentorship role grooming young to become his successor as the head of his new psychoanimal movement. But young was not cut out to be merely someone else's disciple. He kind of wanted to cut his own path. He was ongoing attempts to research new understandings. The mind became increasingly stymied by Freud's dogmatic insistence of his own interpretations. So young was basically wanting to explore and have his own theories and ideas. but Freud was looking for someone to just follow in his footsteps and carry on his own work. In time, Young, he tired of Freud's domineering and paternal manner, and so it was impossible to limit his thinking to Freud's concept of his psychological structure and equally impossible to accept Freud's reluctantness to an ascertainment that all psychological troubles were rooted in sexual matters. So because of those two reasons, Young found himself plenaring away to pursue his own theories separate from Freud's. The form and detail of Jung's theory would prove sweeping and complex. His early exposure to psychic or spiritual phenomena in his grounding in diverse spiritual teachings as well as his work with a profoundly mental ill all considered to give him a very different outlook than that held by Sigmund Freud. Many complain that Jung's work cannot really be applied to the problems of everyday life. Ironically, though, it was a conversation that Carl Jung led to the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous and likewise all related 12-step programs. Jung had advised a chronic alcoholic known only as Ronald H. He had said, upon whatever God you think there is. The lightning of the transforming experience may then strike you. This advice worked where no psychological, religious, or medical therapy had previously succeeded and the prescription was shared with Bill W, now the famous founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. It's worth noting that although 12-step programs have brought innumerable people to a spiritual way of life, both they and Carl Jung are roundly criticized by Christian fundamentalists and refused to accept any spiritual ideology that is not specifically and exclusively promoted by Jesus. Young's theory of mind has meanwhile found a particular warm reception within the new age spiritual movement, some of whose constitutes view him as part of some great wave of light or spiritual effort to bring him humanity out of the dark ages both literally and figuratively. And that is in conclusion my findings and research on Carl Jung. Thank you.","Hello everyone! For my famous therapist paper, I did mine on Carl Jung, or possibly Carl Jung.

We will be able to provide various resources from our companies to the budget transformation process. The third question is about the situation in the public sector. I will now be presenting two books. One is about the development of the silver harvest of Nagoya Shigekai, which is a new generation of citizens. In the 7th of April, we will be discussing the development of the silver harvest, and we will be discussing the development of the people's voices. We have decided to have a special defense system. I think it's a good idea to have a good relationship with the government. I would like to ask the citizens to do the same thing as the government. I think that the idea of understanding and understanding of the mind is sufficient for the mind to use. Even if it is not a natural thing, it is something that should be done in normal. I think that this idea of wanting to be a natural thing in this way means that it is a natural thing. I will now ask Mr. Takahashi to answer the question. The government is still trying to resolve the issue. The next year, the government will have to re-establish the proposed agreement. I would like to ask you to explain the situation in the next session. There is no detailed explanation."

The Naxalis have declared a close-off in five states today. Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Pashimbangal and Chhattisgarh are included in them. The administration has established a security system in these states. Despite this, the Naxalis have flown the railway track and mobile tower in Jharkhand. The 36th house is located in some areas of Bijapur, which are considered to be the roots of the Naxalis. But in these areas, a non-governmental organization has been established to treat villagers. All doctors are abroad in this organization. These doctors are responsible for treating the Naxalis. The Prime Minister of the country has said that he will investigate this matter. If the institution is wrong, then the case will be filed against him. This is the inner village of Bijapur in 36 hours where leaves are moving on the signs of the Nasals. A common man cannot even think of going here. Even the police and army men are willing to go here. But here, a non-governmental organization of the border is afraid and enters these areas and also treats the villagers. The children of those villagers are the Nasali. This is the reason why the doctors are treating the poor here. But according to the villagers, this culture is serving the people with drugs. Then the question arises how these doctors' fate becomes successful in these villages Why don't these doctors make their mark on the Naxal? If they don't make it, then it is necessary to doubt. The doubt is that they will definitely have a connection with the Naxals. If they don't have it, why do they let them enter the village? Now the government has also received news of these Sema Rahid doctors. The Prime Minister of the state is saying that they will definitely investigate it. If this is a social crime, then it will be a critical action against it. If this serious matter is found out that it is for the treatment of the victims or for their help, then it will be identified by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. And if this is the case, then it will be a serious action against it. This is the best medicine for treatment for this reason for the treatment of the patients and also for the high-five technique."

Ведь его внимание отпускать нельзя не на минуту. Все неточности. Здесь нельзя врать, халтурить. То есть, детки, они же ведь настолько чувствительны, они сразу чувствуют фальш. Поэтому вот работаем насколько можно честно. Четыре месяца напряженной работы свою Левту внес каждый сотрудник театра. Яркие декорации, великолепные костюмы, завораживающие музыка. Кстати, специально для этой постановки было написано 12 песен и 50 музыкальных театров. Мне очень помогала музыка, помогали песни, которые хорошо и грамотно написаны. И в них чувствуются отношения и тепло, и доброта, и сказочность.","In the Kursk Oblast Drama Theater, the main rehearsal of the new show Zolushka was held. Julia Abramova visited the scenes and talked to the actors. The story is well known to everyone since childhood. The fairy tale about Zolushka. She lived on the stage of the drama theater and immediately began to fulfill her dream. and the rats in the kitchen. All this is for one purpose – to interest the smallest and most attractive viewer. After all, it is forbidden to let him in for a minute. The child just starts to be jealous, he starts to talk, he starts to get distracted, to interfere with others. Therefore, it is very difficult to keep child's attention. Therefore, there is no way to relax for a second. There must be and must be done in the script. All the details are not accurate. It is impossible to lie here, to lie. That is, children, they are so sensitive, they immediately feel wrong. Therefore, we work as honestly as possible. Four months of hard work, each employee of the theater brought their own left. Bright decorations, magnificent costumes, and exciting music. By the way, there were 12 songs and 50 musical themes written specifically for this setting. I really helped with the music, I helped with the songs that are written well and in them there are feelings of relationship, warmth, kindness and fairy tale. The premiere shows are planned for the beginning of the next season. Yulia Abramov, Andrey Dektyrov, TV Channel 7."

So we have very few ingredients and what I first want to do is go ahead and turn on that stove and put about four tablespoons of oil in the bottom. Okay. And that's going to heat up nicely.

Let's turn this up just a little. Bring it back up a little bit because we're going to add our liquid to the party here. Ginger beer.

Okay, now I'm gonna put a little bit of onion and a little bit of garlic powder, not salt, powder, which also helps it to thicken. All right, doesn't that look delicious? And you wait till it's poured over that rice and those planks of fried salmon, okay? Now, to finish it off, Just to finish it, okay? Mustard. Now we are not looking for bright yellow in this gravy.

В соответствии с регламентом этой организации аналогичные законы будут рассмотрены и приняты парламентами всех стран Содружества, что является прорывом в борьбе с героизацией нацизма на постсоветском пространстве.","Шпигель, нацизм, история, Европа, Борис Шпигель, борьба, Мир без нацизма",959,2,3,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/jrgl-YAA5s0.mp3,"Мы собрались сегодня здесь для того, чтобы подвести итоги нашей деятельности на два лишь с лишним года, обсудить наиболее актуальные вопросы борьбы с нацизмом и агрессивным национализмом, обсудить и принять новую программу нашей организации, а также избрать новые уже постоянные органы управления. Прямо скажем, эти два года не были легкими с точки зрения противодействия неонацизмом. в набирающем силу процесса героизации нацинма прежде всего восточные европейских странах. Малдови, странах Балки, Румынии, Балгарии и других. Причем Малдови, Румынии, Атарев и странах Балки это наконет поддержку со стороны нынешних властей в активных попытках навязать мировому сообществу. Свои видны истории, особенно истории Второй мировой войны, которая основывается на уравнивание гигарослей Германии СССР, что разбывая значение трагии и в на на в и и мы лишим вас ряда политических и социально-экономических прав, зато у вас будут стимулы как семиляции. Вспомним, хотя позорящих Европу института, называемых не граждан, в Латвии и Астонии. В таких странах, до сих пор, ломают голову над тем, почему же закончились ничем, ничем все интеграционные программы, а меньшинство активно не хотят учить свои детей в школах титульного большинства, по прежде в на другой уровне. Собывание 90-х года выше Игорь Слави и в Косово доказывают это. Второй группой причин роста радикально-насценаристских и нацистских застренений является причиной экономического характера. Экономическая нужда решает людей возможность контролировать свою личную жизнь и не имея выбора и надежды, они часто становятся объектом для манипулирования со стороны самой опасных политистских течений включения нацистские. Это особенно актуально и так далее. Поэтому, по мере того, как в старом национальной политике становится все более чевинен, нарастают и попытки насильственной симиляции Минширдс. Вход идет все. Он запрет на государство финансирование учебных заведений, где преподавание ведется на языке национальных Минширдс до атиизации работ так называемых языковых инспектов, которые используют методы оперативно-растной деятельности, а слеживают тех, кто недостаточно употребляет и в этой среде.","We have gathered here today to provide the results of our activities for over a year, discuss the most relevant issues of fighting with Nazism and aggressive nationalism, discuss and accept the new program of our organization, and also choose new, already constant, management bodies. I will tell you right away that these two years were not easy, due to the opposition to Nazism. Unfortunately, the activity of the influence of the nationalistic organizations is growing. The number of radical extremist groups is increasing. Over the past years, this number has become more and more common. In the demorganization of this group and the growth of the ideological influence of the voters, we know that today in Europe there is almost no country left where the parliament would not be represented, but in the absence of the government and the nationalistic parties. The number of crimes in the post of hatred is increasing. Some of them have shaken the world with their scale. In the process of heroization of Nazism, the Eastern European countries, Malbov, Balke, Rumyna, Bulgaria and others, and Malbov, Rumyna, and the Dalai Lama, will find support from the present-day authorities in the attempt to impose a world peace on society, especially the history of the Second World War, which is based on the level of the Deglerosk and Germany-SR, which is breaking the value of the tragedy of the Russian people. and the attack on the Russian state of affairs. This is the reason why we are in a serious social conflict. which is speculated on this, not without success, the electorate is earning. The connection of the objective reasons with the objective actions of the nationalists gives the results not only to the implementation of the legislation of the authorities, but also to the extent of the crime on the basis of hatred. The Nazi movement was killed by more than 70 people. Not long ago, we were killed by the families of the dead children of the Toulouse. And from this scary recent crime on the ground of the Semitino-Union United States of America, we remember the rise of the rise of the Afrikan people in the Italian florets, the organized mass mass of the Nazi movement on the Mayesh Square in Moscow, December 10th. I want to note that all these events happen in those countries that are so much affected by any manifestation of aggressive nationalism. In these countries there is an understanding that radicals represent the threat of national poverty. But there are countries where the nationalist has long been in power, covering various ideas of returning to the United Iran of national culture and establishing its national state, interpreting its own laws, The historical events of the 20th and 40th centuries led to the establishment of the National Union. The courts were very strict. Before the United Nations, foreign countries were on their own. In some countries, there are even racial problems. When representatives of the indignation and even representatives of separate national clans were not only political influence, but also elementary social guarantee. In other countries, the authorities proudly stated that the path to indignation is open for the people. We must only assimilate. And while you did not assimilate, We are only a few political and social economic rights, but you will have a wall like a wall. Let us remember the shameful European institutions, as we call them, not citizens of Latvia and Estonia. In such countries, who still break their heads on why they have ended, why all integration programs, and the majority actively do not want to teach their children in schools of the title majority, but still react They don't care that the same national offense remains for decades, if not for centuries, in the memory of the people. And no patriotic calls will lead to positive results. The second reason is the economic need. It helps people to control their personal life and not to have to choose their hopes. They often become objects of manipulation by the most powerful political elements of the nation. The current economic crisis is the result of which is needed and poor in the mass-sum. Look what is happening in Greece, where the youth of the parliament, by the way, the party of the Golden Ramp, will arrange the form of the influx of foreign trade on the market. Look how they buy the food for poor people. And it works, and this is understood by many people. The world is at the brink of crisis, which can be characterized as a crisis of the state or a crisis of old national politics, which are trying to apply in new changing conditions. Old national politics built on the trend, and the need for assimilation or the withdrawal of the mass, turns out to be in a state of newness. And new ideas are not appearing and in appearance fear of the nationalists of the world. Therefore, as the old national policy becomes more and more obvious, attempts to increase the number of refugees are being made. Everything is going in. The ban on state funding of the Russian education institution, where the education is being introduced in the Russian language, gives the organization the work of the so-called language inspectors, who use the methods of operational growth of the activity, and track those who do not use enough resources. The Russian government is following the path of the Russian government, including the business sector. The government is following the path of the Russian government, including the business sector.

Da poco eletto democraticamente capitano reggente del sultanato di Bambù. Poche ore ci separano dal 2010. Caro Barone, buonasera. Un messaggio alla nazione. Buonasera a voi, a voi tutti italiani. Il messaggio che la e la mia piccola strigrazione, anzi tutto per il democraticamente sottolineato, da poco sono molto contento di reggere questo stato, anche se non siamo ancora a livello dei Colornelli, siamo a livello di capitani, un po' alla volta si cresce. Naturalmente tu come vedi, sono sempre accompagnata dalla mia segretà, e dal mio collaboratore che sta dietro, se puoi inquadrare alle spalle, che sono sempre collaboratori. Per quanto riguarda il messaggio alla Nazione che posso dire che noi collaboriamo molto assituamenti con l'economia italiana che come vedi anche negli ultimi tempi ho leggo molto, cioè molto, mi collaboro ma passo le notizie di quella che è la nostra diciamo stampa e mi mail con l'Italia e reciprocamente viceversa sulla cassa dei posti di epresso di questa scandalosa questione della cassa dei posti di epresso di che non ho con gli elementi tali da poter valutare e da poter permettere di approfondire il discorso. Per quanto riguarda l'economia globale sappiamo che è un po' in crisi dappertutto. Noi però abbiamo fatto, cerchiamo di risolvere il problema vostro di la disoccupazione. Non con le nostre canne di bambù, ci mai ci soffiamo dentro, però abbiamo esportato tutte le nostre banane in Italia, perché tardano noi. Quindi in questo modo ci potrei per cercare di tentare di dare un lavoro alla disoccupazione giovanile un lavoro e di soli del problema, pardon, della disoccupazione giovanile cioè queste barane così grandi il giovane potrebbero tentare di rantrizzarle in questo modo le starebbero impegnati in questa attività che potrebbe costruire anche produttività tu sai, Keynes faceva scavare le buche poi le faceva riempire dagli operai, giusto per dare attività lavorativa allo stesso tempo potrebbe ritornare, è utile una banana di ritta occupare ripeto in giovane a pulista materiale economica e psicologico in modo che si toglierebbe un po' di oziosità a questo tempo libero che hanno avuto questi giovani quindi come dicevi, tu poco anzi, mitigare e limitare anche questa aggressività la tente. Voi, italiani, limitate questa aggressività la tente comprando suve, spendendo soldi per le macchine mentre invece noi cerchiamo di una guerra qui, la guerra all'insovo, ma abbiamo riviato all'anno prossimo la guerra con la Repubblica di San Marino, cioè voglio dire insomma cerchiamo di tenerci su in modo che questo stalo della Repubblica dei capitani possa diventare finalmente stato dei comornelli. Per quanto riguarda il resto non so che dirti il messaggio che io rivolgo ai miei, pardon, cittadini e quello di essere ottimisti, perché essendo ottimisti e sono capitale, insomma, ho tutte le responsabilità della regenza di questo Stato. Buon anni a tutti, buon anno a tutti voi italiani, buon anno qui dai miei sudditi, ai miei cittadini, con cittadini che spero di amministrare il miglior modo possibile e speriamo che il 2010 sia un anno chiaramente che per me è un anno più potremmo dire era meglio il 2010 che non il 2011.

From a very young age, democratically elected, the current captain of the Sultanate of Bambo, a few hours separate us from 2010. Dear Baron, good evening, a message to the nation. Good evening to you, to all of you Italian, the message that I thank you for the democratic sub-lineat, I am very happy to be able to see this state, even if we are not yet at the level of the colonel, we are at the level of the capitals, the time is growing. As you can see, I am always accompanied by my secretariat here and by my collaborator who is behind, if you can see from the back, who is always I would like to thank the Italian economy for its support. We have to use the Italian elements to evaluate the situation. We know that the global economy is in crisis. We have tried to solve your problem of unemployment. We have never been able to solve our problems with our children. But we have taken away all our bananas in Italy. trying to give a job to the youth unemployment. A job that solves the problem of youth unemployment. These are big bananas. The youth could try to re-treat them. In this way they would be committed to this activity that could also build productivity. You know that Enzo used to dig the holes and fill them with the work, just to give work activity. At the same time it could be useful. A banana of the right. to occupy the youth of the material purist economy and also the psychological one, so that it would be a bit of a rarity at that time, because of these youths, so as you said, you can, in fact, limit this agressiveness to the tent. You Italians limit this agressiveness to the tent buying shoes, spending money for the cars, while we are looking for a war here, We have a war there, we have a war with the Republic of San Marino next year, we are trying to keep this state of the Republic of the Capitans, I can finally become a colonel. As for the rest, I don't know what to tell you, the message that I convey to my citizens is that of being optimistic, because being optimistic I am a captain, I will take responsibility for the legacy of this state. Good years to all, good years to all Italians, good years to my citizens, with citizens, I hope to manage as best as possible. We hope that in 2010, if one year, clearly, and that was better than 2010, not 2011. Many greetings and see you soon."

Si parla di self publishing, editoria personale e di come diventare boss di se stesso lavorando come editore indipendente.  Dialogando con i presenti esce fuori che in Italia non sono ancora generalmente diffusi i new media e il self publishing per un problema di mentalità. Francesco distingue tra due diversi modi di porsi davanti alla realtà: gli americani dicono ""Why not?"", gli italiani invece dicono ""Why?"".

Just tell me that you love me and I'll accept it Even if it's not true, the love I give is just a waste of who I am I'm looking for the two in front of them I'm ready, even if I'm afraid, I'll be like you Because you're just a fool to me, you're just a love to me It's just a waste of what I should be, I'll change"

Distancia es igual a valor absoluto de 8 por 7 más 4 por 5 menos 9 sobre 8 al cuadrado más 4 al cuadrado. 8 por 7 es 56, 4 por 5 es 20 y menos 9 se baja. 8 al cuadrado es 64 y 4 al cuadrado es 16. 20 menos 9 más 56, 67 y 64 más 16, 80. Aquí solo se pasa, se pasaría el 67 y el 80 se sacaría la raíz cuadrada que sería 8.94. Aquí vamos a dividir 67 sobre 8.94 es 7.15, nuestro punto vendría quedando como por aquí. Para que yo pueda marcar nuestro plano cartesiano, tenemos que tener nuestra coordenada. Entonces tenemos que darle valor a x y a y, en este caso yo le di el valor de cero a ambas, siempre tienen que ser semejantes. Entonces, x es igual a cero, 8 por cero cero, entonces se elimina y seguimos más 4y menos 9 es igual a cero, seguimos sustituyendo 4y menos 9 es igual a cero, como este aquí se multiplica acá pasa dividiendo 4 y 3 9 es igual a cero punto 40 y 4 y el resultado de nuestra x seria de 0.44 el valor de la y, y igual le dimos el valor de 0 8x más 4, 0 menos 9 es igual a 0 como les dije 4 por 0 no tiene valor, sería 0 entonces eliminamos y seguimos sustituyendo 8x menos 9 es igual a 0 como les dije este, aquí pasa multiplicando, acá pasamos dividiendo 8 entre 9 es igual a 0.88 y el valor de nuestra y sería de 0.88 ahora solo hay que marcar nuestras coordenadas como x me dio 0.44 nuestro punto vendría quedando como por aquí y y 0.88 vendría quedando por aquí entonces tenemos que marcar nuestra línea X y nuestra línea para Y y esta sería nuestra distancia mínima que existen del punto y recta.","The distance from a point to a line. Exercise, calculate the minimum distance between the point A and its coordinates are 7.5 and the line 8x plus 4y minus 9 is equal to 0. The formula used for this exercise is the absolute value of AX plus By over square root of A squared plus B squared. Simplify the values A, C, D, A, 8, B, C, D, A, 4 and C. would be minus 9, x would be 7 and j would be 5 Distance is the same absolute value of 8 x 7 plus 4 x 5 minus 9 over 8 squared plus 4 squared 8 x 7 is 56, 4 x 5 is 20 and minus 9 is low 8 squared 64 and 4 squared 16 20 minus 9 plus 56, 67 and 64 plus 16, 80.

So that I can mark our cartesian plane we have to have our coordinates, so we have to give it value in this case I gave the value of 0 to both, they always have to be similar, so x is equal to 0, 8 by 0, 0, then it is eliminated and we continue plus 4y minus 9 is equal to 0, we continue to replace 4y minus 9 is equal to 0, as this one here is multiplied, here it is dividing, 439 is equal to 0.44 and the result of our x is 0.44 the value of the y, y equals 0 8x plus 4 0 minus 9 is equal to 0 as I told you 4 by 0 does not have value it would be 0 then we eliminate and continue to replace 8x minus 9 is equal to 0 as I told you this here it goes by multiplying here we divide 8 between 9 equals 0.88 and the value of our Y would be 0.88 Now we just have to mark our coordinates as X gave me 0.44 our point will be left as here and Y 0.88 will be left here so we have to mark our line for X and our line for Y and this would be our minimum minimum minimum distance that exists from the point and straight."

Guillermo Sánchez Landa, secretario de registros urbanos de la municipalidad de San Isidro, nos cuenta los detalles de este ambicioso proyecto. y lo que queríamos que nos cuente de qué se trata. Buen día, mira, yo te comento un poquito cómo es esto. Nosotros, por supuesto, que se ha presentado algo por parte de las autoridades del Jockey Club, pero no tenemos ningún tipo de compromiso ni ningún tipo de medida tomada. Esto llegó el proyecto, la idea, fuemos hablando con el Jockey Club, y lo que primero hicimos fue, vamos a colocarlo en consideración de nuestros vecinos, y eso es lo que hicimos. El impacto ambiental y el impacto de tránsito está a disposición de los vecinos para que lo vean, para que lo analicen y para que coloquen en ellos sus propias dimensiones de qué creen que puede pasar en todo esto. Pero para nosotros es muy importante saber que el Jockey Club son tres indespectarias de verde. Tres indespectarias de un verde que es el pulmón más importante que tiene San Isidro y que no lo tiene ningún distrito del colombiano. Con lo cual es muy importante para nosotros, todos los que vivimos en San Isidro, que esto sigue estando como primera medida. Desde ya que para que siga estando 300 hectáreas de verde tiene que haber alguna actividad con EXA que pueda estar aportando dinero a esto, como todos sabemos las carreras cada vez vienen de menos gente y el 90% de lo que es el Jockey Club está en manos de cuidadores, de variadores, los mismos caballos, una actividad totalmente ecológica y que está vinculada al medio ambiente. Pero bueno, necesitan recursos, no puedes tener 300 hectáreas con lo que valen los impuestos en San Isidro, provinciales y o municipales, libres y que no tengan ningún tipo de actividad. Desde ya que el juego no se va a tener en cuenta para acá, por eso las actualidades del Jogglueglu están buscando distintas alternativas. Una alternativa fue esta, no sé qué va a pasar, nadie sabe qué va a pasar, porque esto va a resultar después de dar un chequeo con nuestros vecinos. A partir de ese momento, una vez que todos los vecinos opinen, nosotros haremos los estudios adecuados para ver si va o no va los planos correspondientes de acuerdo a las normas en vigencia. Nos podría detallar más o menos así a nivel general, en qué consiste este proyecto del Jockey Club. Y es un estadio único para Argentina, ya te digo que es un orgullo para San Isidro tener un estadio de esta característica en San Isidro. Pero bueno, sé que por las características a nivel mundial que tienen este tipo de estadios traen espectáculos muy importantes, espectáculos altamente caros, no son espectáculos baratos, con lo cual va a venir cierta cantidad de gente. Desde ya nosotros lo hemos pedido y ellos lo han practicado que los autos ingresen al hipódromo de muchas cuadras antes de lo que viene a ser Santa Fe Centenario, ¿En lo cual esto trae aparejado que los vehículos prácticamente van a circular dentro del Jockey Club? Justamente tenemos el antecedente recientemente del recital del grupo YouTube en el estadio único de la plata con los trastornos que provocó. Exactamente. Por eso los autos van a estar circulando dentro del Jockey Club como permisa básica. Esto es un alivio para todos nosotros. Pero independientemente de eso, el estadio es mucho más chico que el de la plata. Es para 15.000 personas. que va a tener cocheras para 3.000 autos, más todas las cocheras que tiene en todo el campo de The Jockey Club. Es decir, que por estacionamiento no tenemos ni que pensar si fuera ese el problema. Con lo cual yo te diría, es un paliativo para el Jockey Club que realmente tiene que seguir conservando sus instaraciones para beneficio de toda la población de San Isidro. Y la posibilidad de que el vecino de San Isidro tenga un estadio donde va a dar muchos entretenimientos y espectáculos de nivel, como os decía. es muy buen nivel, creo que hay en las principales capitales del mundo nada más, no es un estadio más, es un estadio con características a nivel del primer mundo, está en Sydney, en Australia, está en varios lugares importantes de Estados Unidos, la Florida, es decir, no está en cualquier punto, ellos buscan puntos estratégicos. Y ya te digo que no es muy grande, es muy chico, tiene movilidad próbdita, o sea que se va ampliando o achicando pero con un máximo de hasta 15.000 espectadores, con lo cual creo que hasta es más chico que el luna parjadoras. Como bien dijo usted en el comienzo de esta nota, los vecinos pueden venir aquí al edificio administrativo de Aunía Centenario 77 en San Isidro y consultar y ver este proyecto. Exactamente, fundamentalmente ahí está la propuesta, la propuesta que no la hemos analizado, estamos esperando las propuestas de los vecinos a ver qué opinan con respecto a esto, a partir de ese momento empiece el análisis nuestro. Ya te digo que el vecino tiene que pensar en la solución del hipódromo porque el Jockey Club sabe que el juego solamente es de los caballos, pero nada de maquinitas ni de casino, eso está terminado en San Isidro, esto implica que de alguna manera hay que hacer algo para conservarlo. Son 300 hectáreas de oxígeno, son 300 hectáreas que realmente es un beneficio continuo para nuestra ¿Dónde se ubicaría el estadio en caso de concretarse este proyecto? En principio lo que ellos han presentado, lo que la propuesta de ellos sería en la esquina de Centenario y Marques, yendo hacia el lado de lo que sería el hospital, entre el hospital y Marques, sobre Santa Fe. Si teníamos que hablar de tiempos, ¿cuánto tiempo tiene el vecino para venir a consultar este proyecto? ¿Cuándo en caso de tener luz verde podría empezar a concretarse ¿Hay sobre eso? de la comunidad de San Isidro está tomando todos los recaudos para en caso de concretarse sea un proyecto serio y que no traiga perjuicios a la comunidad de San Isidro. Seguro, para eso está puesto primero en manos de los vecinos, el vecino es el que tiene que opinar, el vecino es el que tiene que venir y decir cosas serias y concretas, o sea, no va el estadio porque no me gusta, eso no es un amigo serio, no va el estadio por esto, por el tránsito, pero el tránsito aparentemente estaría perfectamente estudiado parte de los constructores.","In the facilities of the San Isidro Hipodrome, a building belonging to the Jockey Club, a modern stadium is designed to be built in which multiple activities are going to be carried out. Guillermo Sánchez Landa, Secretary of Urban Registries of the Municipality of San Isidro, tells us the details of this ambitious project. We would like you to tell us what you are talking about. Good morning. I will tell you a little bit about this. We, of course, have presented something through the Jockey Club tutorials, but we do not have any kind of commitment or any kind of taken measure. This came the project, the idea, we were talking to the Jockey Club, and what we did first was to put it into consideration of our neighbors. And that's what we did. The environmental impact and the transit impact are available to the neighbors to see it, to analyze it and to put in them their own dimensions of what they think can happen in all this. But for us it is very important to know that the Jockey Club is three sectors of green. Three sectors of a green that is the most important that has the incinerator and that has no district of the urban. With which it is very important For us, everything we live in San Isidro, this continues to be. From now on, to continue being 300 hectares of green, there must be some activity with the Exa that can be providing money to this. As we all know, the races are coming less and less. And 90% of what the Jockey Club is in hands of care workers, of variators, the same horses. A totally ecological activity. and that is linked to the environment. But hey, you need resources. You can't have 300 hectares with what is worth the taxes in San Isidro, provincial and municipal, free and that have no activity. Since the game is not going to be taken into account here. That's why the activities of the Jogiklub are looking for different alternatives. An alternative is this. I don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows what's going to happen because this is going to be after giving a check with our neighbors. From that moment on, once all the neighbors think about it, we will do the right studies to see if the corresponding plans go according to the rules of the application. Could you give us more or less a general detail on what this project of the Zocay Club consists of? It is a unique stadium for Argentina. I already tell you that it is an pride for San Isidro to have a stadium of this characteristic in San Isidro. But I know that because of the world-class characteristics of these types of stadiums, they have very important shows, very expensive shows, not cheap shows, with which certain number of people will come. Since then we have asked them, and they have practiced it, that the cars enter the lipo of many blocks before what Santa Fe Centenario came to do, In which this has been brought in that the vehicles will practically circulate within the Jockey Club. We have the antecedent recently of the recital of the YouTube group in the only stadium of the silver with the disorders that provoked. Exactly. That's why the cars will be circulating within the Jockey Club as a basic premise. This is a relief for all of us. But regardless of that, the stadium is much smaller than the one of the silver. It is for 15,000 people. and they will have cars for 3,000 cars, plus all the cars that have in the entire Yoke Club field. That is, because of the parking we don't have to think about it. If that were the problem. With which I would say that it is a palliative for the Yoke Club that really has to continue to maintain its facilities for the benefit of the entire population of San Isidro. And the possibility that the neighbor of San Isidro has a stadium where there will be many entertainment and level shows, as you say. I think there are the main capitals of the world, nothing more. It's not just a stadium, it's a stadium with characteristics at the level of the first world, it's in Sydney, Australia, it's in several important places in the United States, Florida, that is, it's not at any point. They seek strategic points. And I tell you that it's not very big, it's very small, it has a real mobility. I mean, they are getting busy or getting busy, but with a maximum of up to 15,000 spectators. So I think this is even smaller than the Moon Parque. As you said at the beginning of this note, the neighbors can come here to the administrative building of Avenida Centenario 77 in San Isiro and consult and see this project. Exactly, fundamentally, there is the proposal. The proposal that we have not analyzed, we are waiting for the proposals of the neighbors to see what they think about this. From that moment on, our analysis begins. I already tell you that the neighbor has to think about the solution of the hippodrome because the Jockey Club knows that the game is only about horses, but nothing about little machines or casino, that is finished in San Isidro. This implies that somehow we have to do something to preserve it. There are 300 hectares of oxygen, there are 300 hectares that really is a continuous benefit for our population. Where would the stadium be located in case of this project being completed? In the beginning, what they have presented, what they propose, would be at the corner of Centenario Marques, going to the side of what the hospital would be, between the hospital and Marques, over Santa Fe. And if we were to talk about time, how long does the neighbor have to come to consult this project? When, in case of having green light, could the stadium be completed? There are 30 days to come to see the project, to notify and do the corresponding appreciations, but regardless of that, the projects of these characteristics are very long. They have to present plans, work plans, try them, see the paths, it is very long. It is a project that until the works begin, above the six months, for sure. Anyway, it is important to tell the neighbor that the municipality is very busy, San Isidro is taking all the necessary precautions to make a serious project and not bring any harm to the community. For sure. That's why the neighbors are first. The neighbors have to come and say serious and concrete things. I mean, I don't like the stadium because I don't like it. That's not a serious thing. The stadium for this, for this, for this, for the transit. But the transit would be perfectly studied part of the builders and the construction."

We hear and see and talk about this with my brothers and sisters throughout this year through these sun-dried seasons that are reflected in some of the seasons that are attributed to this country. They are truly suffering in religion and are ashamed of it because they want to talk to someone or a person. Allah, Almighty, has made great efforts to make the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the Today, we are not aware of the great glory of Allah. and they are not to blame for anything. Because we have talked a lot about this and these are their means and their support and their account. I am the people of mosques. And this word is directed to you and to those who listen to me and to those who were advice for others than those who were after. These people who continue to be in the need and in the need do not blame us for anything. Yes, we are to blame for being in this bad way. But what makes us mean is that a person may pray with people in the prayer of peace, and pray Ramadan, and stand up, and remember Allah, Almighty, and end the Quran in an instant, and he himself is in a state of solitude from where he doesn't feel. In the Ahadah of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with him, I will not say the word, I don't want to say it, because the matter of solitude and fear in it requires to go to the gatherings, and not to the gatherings alone. The Prophet, peace be upon him, in his Ahadah, when he talked to some of the hypocrites and said about him and his companions, we didn't see such as the Qur'an, The companions, may Allah be pleased with them, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, said that they are lying and that they are answering us in the meeting. Now, notice that the verse was revealed by the group of the group. He was a man of good quality. The argument is not about Shari'ah, it is about Shari'ah. They are curious about the cause of the two women's fate. The verse is decided in Surah An-Nisa. In the past year, in the same time, someone writes in Kuwait, the Muslim country, he writes and embodies the Hadith of the Prophet, who built a mosque for Allah, and a house for him in heaven. He says, this house is a boss or three streets or a house of Sid. See, brothers, this is present in us. Unfortunately, we read and nothing moves in it. What's left? Allah has made you listen and watch and memorize religion. The matter is not easy. You are a human being. Allah has made you able to deny and deny. But the matter is that you come and see and see and see and laugh and laugh and you cannot move anything. Allah is great and you are in great danger. And the disbeliever is afraid of you. We ask Allah to forgive. The matter is not easy. He was a man who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able to be a person who was not able Some of the brothers of the great community who know the truth, religion and the protection of the Sharia. They are ashamed and put in their place to be persecuted at night and day. They leave the disbelievers, Jews, Christians and the hypocrites and pray to the servants of Allah. The issue is that man is being deported. Yes, the word came late, but in fact, if there was not much to talk about and talk about, People are constantly following this matter with the time.

I appreciate it. Have you recovered from last weekend yet? Are you still waking up in the middle of the night thinking about it? I you never recover from something like that, you know, you try to replay every play in the that you called in your mind and what you could have done differently and It was a tough way to end the season, but we did a lot of good things a lot to look forward to. No question. You know that JJ Watt interception you just got a handed to him. He just made a play. What did the Texans do defensively that couldn't get you guys back in that game where you guys couldn't get the points offensively. You know they're they're very good defensive team. They rush the pass extremely well and they mixed up their coverage is very good and and and it was so loud. I mean it was the loudest place I've ever been around. You know my microphone kept going out in and out and Andy had trouble and we just couldn't quite get in the rhythm and when we got down two scores and we had to throw it all the time, it really strengthened their defensive scheme because that's what they want you to do. They wanted to force you to throw it and they can send their dogs loose and they had a lot of success doing it. What does he have to do in the offseason now to take that next step coach? He just has to continue getting better, getting stronger. And the more he sees and the more he anticipates, the better he's going to be. And I just got to get some players around them that know where they're going, know what to do. And he's just going to be a better player next year because of his experience this year. Sitting on the bench taking notes wouldn't have done them any good. But playing in 17, 18 games like you did this year, experience are going to take him to another level I believe next year and we'll get better around them. Guys will get more familiar with the offense and more comfortable and I think as a whole the offense will be a lot better next year. Did he even exceed your expectations or did you expect this from him when you brought him in? I expected it really. You know he's a bright guy. He's played four years in college. He started four years. He won a lot of games and he's always been a winner. He's been a very accurate quarterback, very tough, very durable and that's kind of what we expected when we got him. I was happy to get him in the second round obviously and and I thought he would be a guy, the one guy in college football who would come in as a rookie and play because of all the experience he had in college and all the concepts that they did in college, very professional like under center, shotgun, quick game, seven step drops. He did it all in college and was very, very effective obviously. And I thought he was the one guy that could come in as a rookie and really perform well. And he did. Bengl's offensive corner, Jay Gruden joined us here on 97.1. The fan towards the end of the year, Bernard Scott got a little bit more care and kind of both guys shi a little bit as an offi do you like using two runni year? Do you need a guy a think uh, and the NFL is a running backstage. I can carry the ball. Uh, at you saw Houston, they do even though the best backs in flip they still use t get this carries. And I think it's going and whoever our next year, you know, if and somebody else in here to help Bernard Scott out a little bit, you know, and and try to get him more carry. He's got great vision. He's got great explosiveness and he's a big play way to happen. We just got to give him more touches and give more ability, more of an ability to do that. This was your first year offensive coordinator in the NFL. What was it? Everything that you thought it was going to be where there's some surprises along the way that you weren't expecting? You know, there's always surprises. You know, defenses nowadays are very, very, very good and. you have to really game plan each week and prepare for each defense accordingly. But it was a great year. I think the biggest surprise was how hard our guys worked and how much they bought in right away to the system and were willing to come into practice every day and work hard and what they were told and really prepare themselves. It was a great experience. Andy and AJ and our offensive line, they all just bought in and did a great job. And I think next year it'll be even better with the familiarity that they have now with the system. some interviews to be a head coach and didn't want to do it and re signed with the Bengals for three years. Now is your ultimate goal to be a head coach or do you like what you're doing now and we'll see what the future holds. I like what I'm doing now and we'll see. You know I've never really worried about what's in front of me. I always try to take care of the job at hand and got a great job here. Worked for a great coach and Marvin Lewis and got a great group or young count like I've talked about already. And it's a great situation here and sometimes being a head coach isn't all that is cracked up to be be there's so many things you gotta deal with on and off the field that being a coordinator sometimes a little bit more fun. But eventually down the road maybe someday if I do get an opportunity maybe I'll take that challenge but right now I think we got a great future in front of us here in Cincinnati and I want to be part of that. Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden joined us here on 97.1 the fan alright the Bengals have two first round picks are you and Mike Zimmer gonna arm wrestle on who gets the picks how is that going to be decided. I will win that arm wrestling match. to do that. I am a lot stronger than Mike Zimmer. But you know what, we were trying to make our team stronger and you know, we have some needs that have to be addressed. I know the cornerback position and safety and defense of line need to be addressed. We'd like to get another offensive line. We'd like to get a running back. So we're going to hopefully take the best player available. Come in and help us like our rookies did this year with AJ and Andy. And if we get a couple more pieces to the puzzle, we got a chance to be really good and really competitive again next year. And we just got to be very selective in who we get and whoever whatever it is, whether it's a defensive guy or a defensive guy as long as they help us, I don't really care. I'd coach who's going to win the Super Bowl. Who's going to win the Super Bowl? I'm thinking the Pax still. I think where Aaron Rodgers is playing, I think their defense is struggling a little bit, but they still have the ability to get turnovers. Aaron Rodgers is a complete stud, but that's who I'm thinking. Enjoy the offseason, coach. We appreciate it. We'll talk again soon. I will do it. Thanks for having me on. Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden joining us on the Frontier Communications Fan Hotline. line.","It's bringing our guy got a new contract Bengals offensive coordinator our guy Jay Gruden joins us on the frontier communications fan hotline coach good to talk to you Oh, thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. Have you recovered from last weekend yet? Are you still waking up in the middle of the night thinking about it? I you never recover from something like that, you know, yeah Try to replay every play in the that you called in your mind and what you could have done differently and It was a tough way to end the season, but we did a lot of good things a lot to look forward to. No question. You know that JJ Watt interception you just got a hand it to him. He just made a play. What did the Texans do defensively that couldn't get you guys back in that game where you guys couldn't get the points offensively. You know they're they're very good defensive team. They rush the pass extremely well and they mixed up their coverage is very good and and and it was so loud. I mean it was the loudest place I've ever been around. You know my microphone kept going out in and out and Andy had trouble and we just couldn't quite get in the rhythm and when we got down two scores and we had to throw it all the time, it really strengthened their defensive scheme because that's what they want you to do. They wanted to force you to throw in and they can send their dogs loose and they had a lot of success doing it. What does he have to do in the offseason now to take that next step coach? He just has to continue getting better, getting stronger. And the more he sees and the more he anticipates, the better he's going to be. And I just got to get some players around them that know where they're going, know what to do. And he's just going to be a better player next year because of his experience this year. Sitting on the bench taking notes wouldn't have done them any good. But playing in 17, 18 games like you did this year, experience are going to take to another level I believe next year and we'll get better around them. Guys will get more familiar with the offense and more comfortable and I think as a whole the offense will be a lot better next year. Did he even exceed your expectations or did you expect this from him when you brought him in? I expected it really. You know he's a bright guy. He's played four years in college. He started four years. He won a lot of games and he's always been a winner. He's been a very accurate quarterback, very tough, very durable and that's kind of what we expected when we got him. I was happy to get him in the second round obviously and and I thought he would be a guy, the one guy in college football who would come in as a rookie and play because of all the experience he had in college and all the concepts that they did in college. Very professional like under center, shotgun, quick game, seven step drops. He did it all in college and was very, very effective obviously. And I thought he was the one guy that could come in as a rookie and really perform well and he did. and kind of both guys shar a little bit as an of coordinator. Do yo running backs or next year a guy and then to stick w NFL now with the poundi back stake. You need to have carry the ball at some point. Houston, they do even though the best backs in flip they still use he gets this carries. And I to get two backs uh go our next year, you know, and somebody else in here to help Bernard Scott out a little bit, you know, and and try to get him more carry. He's got great vision. He's got great explosiveness and he's a big play way to happen. We just got to give him more touches and give more ability, more of an ability to do that. This was your first year offensive coordinator in the NFL. What was it? Everything that you thought it was going to be where there's some surprises along the way that you weren't expecting? You know, there's always surprises, you know, defenses nowadays are very, very, very good. you have to really game plan each week and prepare for each defense accordingly. But it was a great year. I think the biggest surprise was how hard our guys worked and how much they bought in right away to the system and were willing to come into practice every day and work hard and what they were told and really prepare themselves.

Very, very... very good. The heart of the heart. Very well. The hair guard. Why is it called a hair guard? Because if you forget it, there is a hair inside. So we call it a hair guard. And well, if it's a tie, it can be a little bit like this, but it's fine. Tom Reader's diary, which if I don't forget it now, it doesn't kill him because now I live with Gabriel and I put the most recent secrets. In the diary, Tom... Sorna... I'm going to understand.

Selon l'ordre de la compilation du Coran, elle a été révélée après Sourate Al-Fajr. Elle appartient au début de la période mécquoise ( avant la Hijra).  La Tradition indique également que la révélation avait cessé pendant un temps, ce qui causa le chagrin et la tristesse du Prophète (paix et salut sur lui). Il craignait avoir commis une quelconque erreur ayant causé la colère de son Seigneur et son abandon.  Le thème de cette sourate est la consolation du Prophète -paix et bénédictions sur lui- et dissiper sa peine causée par la suspension de la Révélation ( Wa7y). Elle indique au prophète que le Bon Dieu ne l'a pas abandonné et il n'est pas non plus mécontent de lui. Elle indique aussi au prophète les bienfaits que dieu -Exalté et Glorifié soit-il- lui a accordé. Aussi, Allah indique au prophète -Paix et bénédictions sur lui- comment traiter les nécessiteux et les orphelins et de se montrer toujours reconnaissant pour les bienfaits que Dieu lui a accordé. ''Par la clarté du matin et par la nuit quand elle étend ses voiles ! En vérité, ton Seigneur ne t'a ni abandonné ni haï ! Certes, la vie future te réserve plus de joies que la vie présente, et ton Seigneur te comblera bientôt de bienfaits dont tu seras satisfait. Ne t'a-t-Il pas trouvé orphelin quand Il t'a recueilli? Ne t'a-t-Il pas trouvé égaré quand Il t'a guidé? Ne t'a-t-Il pas trouvé démuni quand Il t'a enrichi? Alors, ne brime jamais l'orphelin ! Ne repousse jamais l'homme qui est dans le besoin ! Quant aux bienfaits de ton Seigneur, n'oublie jamais de les proclamer ! ''.  Les mérites de sourate « Ad-Dohâ » :    Le Coran est Le Livre de méditation par excellence, et à la lecture de cette sourate, le cœur du croyant se rassure, se tranquillise face à l'adversité. En rappelant à Son serviteur Ses bienfaits à son égard, Allâh lui atteste de Son amour pour lui, et lui enseigne par ce biais le moyen de se débarrasser du doute attisé par le démon : se remémorer les faveurs divins et rendre grâce.  et pour ceux désirant un endroit de science et de partage entre musulmans , venez vers ce forum francophone islamique ( http://musulman-e-s.forumjv.com/0-103323-0-1-0-1-0-0.htm) vous me trouverez ainsi que beaucoup de freres et soeur pour nous entraidez mutuellement a atteindre le firdaws insha'allah !","Islamique, Nasheed, Quran, Ahmed, Sous, Ramadan, Phonétique Hd, Dhuha, Fr, Hq, Arabe, Muhammad, Allah, Ad Duha, Surah, Sourate, Sheikh, ad doha, Islam, phonétique, Imam, Sous Titrée, Koran, HD, Prophet",9521,90,6,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/nrUe-Buft88.mp3,5. بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم 6. والضحى 7. والليل إذا سجاه 8. ما ودعك ربك وما قلى 9. وللآخرة خير لك من الأولى 10. ولسوف يعطيك ربك فترضى 11. ألم يجدك يتيما 7. ووجدك ضل فهدا ووجدك عائلا فأغنا فأما اليتيم فلا تقهر وأما السائل فلا تنهر,"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.

And in some areas of the county, especially south of the lake, there were anywhere between three and four inches. So anytime we get anywhere between two and a half and three, depending upon what the conditions are in terms of the soil, what happens is we see a major flood event like this. The unknown factor really at this point is just exactly how much rain we're going to receive overnight. There's a significant system that's moving its way up through the Ohio Valley right now and it should. We're seeing some of that rain right right now right about what's almost five o'clock. But they're depending upon the training effect. We could see storm after storm which could dump another significant portion of rainfall on an already drenched community right now. The watershed has taken on a ton of water. I know that our folks have actually been down the southern part of the county have a lot of water in the field. So there's still a lot of water to move through you know just the area in general. So what we've done right now is we've made sandbags available. Okay. Given the fact that the weather service is predicting a crest at 15 feet somewhere after noon on Friday. We will see an update to that hopefully in the near future. Okay. Webinar that we had earlier today actually just a few hours ago just indicates the same thing. They're very very concerned about the amount of rain that's coming this way. So we're just really preparing for the worst and hoping for the best at this point. So we have sandbags that are available at the Parker, excuse me, Parker Lumberlot down off of West Crawford. We also have sandbags available at Amri Adams Park. And sandbags available up at the north end of town at the Cube. We have notified residents in the Spring Lake area that water is quickly going to make the roads impassable. to go ahead and make arrangements to evacuate themselves now. We're also going to be notifying residents in the East View and West View area that that is going to be a situation, the same situation where we're going to encourage them to leave now as opposed to us having to come in and get them. I know there have been a couple of sort of more minor road closures throughout the area. Are you expecting any of the major roads I know it's getting pretty close on Main Street. More than likely Main Street will close here shortly. When it gets around I think around the 13 to 14 foot time frame or level that's when Main Street starts to close. More than likely by the time everyone gets up to go to work tomorrow morning the only north south route infindly that will be available will be I-75. So folks will probably want to take care when they're driving. Do not drive around barricades. express that enough. It's very dangerous. You know, we're just, they're there for a reason. It's because we don't think that they're safe enough to drive on. So our guys will be working through the night and as the streets are covered with water and they're impassable, they'll be blocked off. I just actually got off the telephone with Superintendent Dean Whitworth of the City Schools and informed him that transportation may be very difficult tomorrow for their school buses and just parents trying to get their kids to school. They're going to monitor the situation, they're in constant contact with us. They'll make that determination as necessary. Certainly, certainly, you know, any time, especially in the downtown area, when we see flooding of this magnitude, it definitely affects businesses. But really it affects the entire community because it kind of shuts things down for a period of time. We're really hoping that we don't get the rainfall that they're anticipating and that this will remain a major flood. 15 feet is nothing to put aside. I mean, it's definitely, it's a big event for us. But we'd like not to see anything larger than that at any point in time. But yeah, all businesses in the community will be affected. Just getting people in and out of work is gonna be difficult.","As everyone probably knows just by looking outside we've got a significant amount of rainfall.

Welcome to the Fold for June 23rd 2009. Joining me as always is Nick Martin. And we're going to be playing some water warfare on the Japanese WiiWare service. This came out this morning. Pretty awesome. It's pretty darn fun. I would say it's the best first-person shooter game on the WiiWare service so far. It'll be coming to North America and Europe eventually. Probably sometime in the center as it's themed very much around the summer. It's first-person shooter game. We don't use These guns use squirt guns. And everything's basically water. You try to soak each other. Instead of R rated, this is G. This is G for great. Alright, let's jump into it. Alright, so we're gonna have a little competition here. Me against Nick. We also have two computer players put in. You can play with up to eight people on Wi-Fi. Locally you can play with two people and then two computers. So game controls with the weirdmote and nunchuck. This is what you assume. I really want to know how this cork works. There's a lot of items in the game. It basically corks the other players gun, but we don't know where you're supposed to fire it. Yeah, we're not quite sure about that It's gone. It's moved the docks move They ran away the court when you set up. Yeah, each course changes. I like that Whoa, there's a lot of little hot silver here. Where you running to wait until you come over here. Well, I'm right here Come on. Yeah, let's soak you How many first-person shooter games can you say that I'm gonna drench you I'm gonna drench you man one more shot I'll be fine. I'll be in the lighthouse if you need me. How many first-person shooters can you say that in? Not many. First-person shooters? I would have to say none. So obviously you can't go in the water because that would make you more wet. Top right corner of each of our screens it shows how dry we are with a little shirt icon. Oh, raincoat! Yeah come and get it because I got a hammer waiting for your face. Yeah, right here. By the raincoat. Come on, you little punk. Yeah, back up into the water. What'd you get? It's kinda cool too if you hit the palm trees, little coconuts will fall out and stun your enemies. Who's dead? Jesus! Look how close you are! You didn't use the raincoats, dude. I didn't have it. Yeah, you did. You know I never picked it up. You backed up into it. I'll be in my little tiki hut. Where are you? So, it's gonna get my raincoat. We're playing... First person get 10 points. There's actually a lot of modes you can play in. with the Z button on the weird mode. Mixed with a hammer. Ah! Get away! You know what? You had the raincoat. I didn't use it. I backed up into it. Top left corner shows you what item you have. There's a lot of them. Raincoats, corks to plug each other's goats up. We don't know how to do that yet. That'd be funny. We don't know how to use the cork yet. Then there's like some kind of glue. Yeah, there's glue is an item which makes the person go slow when you shoot it at him. But it's really, obviously, imagine that's a little bizarre and unnecessary. I like the way you can hit the, you can even hit the chairs and that makes people fly all over the place. Nick's just naturally going for me when I'm trying to take out other people. Yeah, I don't think you're gonna take that, yo. Come here, Nick. Yeah, I did. Come here. Punk. I'm out. Yeah, if you run out of water, if you run out of water, you got to either pick up a new gun or you have to go over to water, look down at it, and that fills up your... Better just to get a new gun. Better just to get a new gun, yes. Oh, you punk? That's where Nick camps out. Nick likes to camp out. I do not camp out! Watch this video. I love this computer. He's just getting there, getting hit. Well, we have the computer set on medium. You can set the computers on easy, medium, or high. There's an easy kill for you right there. See, look! He's camping out by the... You can also dual-wheel guns, like I'm doing right here at Pop Screen. Only like kind of like Halo. You only get pistols with dual-wheel. No, you can do it with the automatics. You can't do it with a shotgun. You can't do it with a big gun. I'm stuck in the damn chair! I'm stuck in the chair! So there's a lot of courses the beach is one the There's a canyon also a little like plaza like a cow and then The playground which I think the playground is the best I'd say the playground is probably the best Nick is one kill away from victory. I have what's new on the fold, huh? What's new? One of these days they I'm just gonna pull out a knife and stab them so stay tuned Who your camp look at all? No, I'm not camping. I just went after Oh, shit. That's another thing I'm never here. Oh, he's camping by the raincoat. Kill him. I want to get my chill, you jerk. Let me kill that guy. I'll do it for you. Where is he? Yeah, he's down to nothing. Congratulations. Where's the new? Where's that? Raincoat, raincoat, raincoat. Where's the ginormous bazooka? I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous bazooka. I don't want that somewhere. There is a ginormous baz to use the rank code you had it. Oh my god I forgot about the rank code. Wow. Wow so there's the overall score 10 for Nick. You died 5 times I died 5 times but I only got 60 kills. It's a fun game. That's positive. That's positive. Killed death but I mean squirt to death and you start talking now. Alright guys for WeFolder.com this is Josh Thomas, Nick Martin. Hope you guys enjoyed this sneak peek look at Water Warfare. It's really fun like I said 8 player Wi-Fi 800 Nintendo points it'll be coming to North America and Europe sometime this summer. And then we're gonna go on Wi-Fi and I'm gonna get you there.

Okay, is that how you open Ultimate Team? Yes, alright. I guess this is just going to be the unpacking video. And next video will be the actual game. Alright, what is this? What is this nonsense? Okay, so I guess the new edition Ultimate Team. I'm going to assume that I don't get any crazy What's the word what's the word I'm looking for? Packs or anything for playing ultimate team in the past since as you can tell by the buttons in the bottom left I'm playing on the ps the I'm going with the PlayStation from here on out and I'm pleased to learn a couple days ago that you can import the draft class from NCAA 14 so I doubt I'll be doing a franchise, actually you never know, but I kinda wanna do my player instead. So let's get right down to it and pick the guy we want on our team. I kinda want Marius Jones through and I'm just kinda falling off over the years because of injury history. Don't really want a quarterback. I think I can do without a decent quarterback Hmm Yeah, we're gonna go Maurice John Street because I do like Maurice John Street and I do like their jerseys Yeah, MJ drew mojo drew pocket Hercules Yes Yes, Maurice John Street one open pack unopened packs that what I said Rob Gronkowski, I'm going to assume that is the training camp version So it's pretty baller, tight end, Aryan Foster. Now that's kind of a bummer that I have Maurice Jones Drew. We're gonna go ahead, Anthony Sherman. Let's see if we get anything really awesome. Who's our quarterback? Training camp, Tom Brady. I'll take it. Let's see. Throw, power, 83. Throw accuracy, 85. T-deep. I'm going to assume is deep throw. I don't know. So pretty good stats on that Tom Brady card. I don't know, 9, 10, 11. I don't know if that's what everyone gets, but I'm happy with it mojo drew AJ green good wide receiver Brandon Marshall good wide receiver Okay, all right. I'm happy with my team And they'll see what our starting lineup looks like So we got head-to-head seasons solo challenges Select solo challenges. Should I do this like right off the bat? Yeah Might as well right? Yeah, we're going to do this. Why not? my starting lineup and we're gonna do this game it's probably gonna be on the easiest difficulty of all time it's still easy all right I don't care let me get to my team starting lineup let's set it best lineup okay looks good enough to me I'm actually gonna have my kick and punt returner be Marish Jones Drew unless no Francis is better we're gonna stick with Francis why not would you like to save your changes yes I would actually I have one unopened pack from what? Loyalty pack? Is this from my EA account? Since I have the same one on Bolt Systems? Alright. Pretty crap if you ask me. I'm not going to use the Mark and Murray yet. Wait till contracts run out or something. I have 12,500 whatever. I need to go back again. And actually I want to take a look at the packs. See how much packs cost. I'm guessing any of these bring me to this store? Gold starter pack. 250,000 coins and nowhere near I don't even have enough for the beginner pack. What is this? Pro pack Pro pack It's all there is One pro pack thought they would have something better than that. All right. I don't know Let's start this up. Let's go against the Ravens with my current team. I really hope head-to-head seasons is not broken Like it was in FIFA. Oh wait wait wait wait wait. No, that's not what I want to do and And I think NCAA 14 was like that too. Where you can't see the rating of... Where's this challenge? What? Where'd the challenge go? But anyways, I didn't like NCAA 14 and I didn't like... What? FIFA because you can never see the other... Really? The other team. Like their rating. And then you'd be all bronze versus like a crazy team. Okay, really? What happened to the challenge? Because I backed out, I can't do whatever That's not the Baltimore Ravens. Okay, got you. What? Can I seriously not do this? Alright, well I guess that's going to wrap up this video because that's kind of BS if you ask me. Next video will either be a my player thing. I'll probably either be running back or quarterback. Or an ultimate team thing depending on how I decide to do it. And that actually really bothers me that I can't do that challenge. the... there's no way. Really? If I do this, will it like force me to... okay, I get it. Huh. Well, that's a disappointment. Okay, well, that's gonna wrap it up for this video. Hope you guys enjoyed it.

No lo pienso, pero están los planes, pero igual no es momento. ¿Vote a Matías? No, no. Todavía no. Esa cosa estoy hablando. No, pero está bueno porque si persona es como vos. En realidad, muchos de los que de los que tenemos de esta edad, sabemos que dentro de 15 años, 15 años, o sea, no me laño que viene, empieza otro tipo de política, que no es la misma que ahora. Lo que estamos haciendo de las personas que sabemos que tenemos una situación social que cumplir, es esperar a que esto caiga. Matías, te encontraste con pares en todos estos años y que estés... Pares como vos que recuerdan, que tienen claro un poco el trabajo que tienen que hacer y que estés interactuando ¿Y la mayoría de mi edad? Porque la gente... Hay muchos adultos que están haciendo el trabajo, pero a veces se lo toman mucho como la era de Pisces, el trabajo, muy estructurado todavía. Entonces, por eso hay gente que por ahí intenta llevarte a esto y hacerte la gloria de que todo el mundo sepa lo que uno dice y no, hay que... que tener más tranquilidad, estar más relajado y que es más la imagen que traemos los jóvenes hoy, estar más tranquilos, más que no importe tanto lo que pasa alrededor total, vamos a ir bien igual. Tal cual. German, me gustaría que vos sos el director de la película La educación prohibida, vamos a dejarte hablar un poco porque no nos va a alcanzar el tiempo, pero sí me gustaría que nos contaras cuál es tu... Bueno, el vínculo entre ustedes y contarnos un poco acerca de la película. El vínculo pasa por lo que estaba comentando Matías recién, por llevar todos estos procesos a lo concreto, a las estructuras físicas, como es la escuela, como es la política de Cien-Resien, que van a empezar a transformarse. En este caso, en mi caso particularmente, lo que estamos queriendo transformar es la escuela. Qué bueno. Y la idea misma es en realidad llevar estas ideas al campo de la de la educación. Y cuando uno las quiere llevarse de cuenta que ya estaban ahí hace muchísimo tiempo, nada más que nada más que nos las vemos de cerca. Entonces nosotros estamos realizando una película que se llama la educación prohibida y ahora acabamos o estamos en el proceso de terminar la investigación. Recorrimos aproximadamente entre 7 o 8 países de Latinoamérica, de España y buscando proyectos y contactando proyectos educativos que tengan otra forma de enfocar la educación. Conocer, supongo que conocerás mejor que yo de las escuelas Waldorf. Sí, sí, sí, ya desde no solo las escuelas Waldorf, sino bueno, aquellas que siguen una rama que podríamos llamar alternativa. Me gusta decir alternativa, pero la idea pasa por ahí. Pero en principio, para hacer un resumen, es que la escuela, que sea la escuela a la que comience a dejar ser a los niños. No solamente de los niños índigos. Primero una de las cosas que hablamos siempre con Mati es, como sabemos nosotros que son todos índigos ahora, dejemos de llamarlos así, son los niños. Claro, tal cual. Entonces... No rotular más, claro. Totalmente, entonces... ¿Todo sin excepción? Hay de todo. O sea, el índigo es un traje en realidad. O sea, todos son diferentes, diferentes dimensiones, diferentes galaxias y demás, pero acá, todos en algún momento se ponen un trajecito índigo para poder hacer su función. Entonces por eso son todos los niños. no hay que decir niño indigo cristal, dorado y demás, eso es una especialidad pero que no importa mucho. De alguna forma uno de los problemas que venía a la escuela es este tema de rotular y cambiar una rotulación técnica de la psiquiatría o de la ciencia o de la pedagogía por una rotulación espiritual estamos quedando exactamente lo mismo. Sí, totalmente. Entonces... Sí, porque es separatista el término. Es que la idea es romper con esa idea de separación. Todos sí son únicos y repetibles y esa es la idea. ¿Por qué llamase la educación prohibida? La ocasión prohibida, la ocasión está prohibida este tipo de ocasión porque nosotros nos permitimos que sea posible y esa es la verdadera cuestión, digamos. Nosotros no concebimos la idea de que un niño pueda crecer y educarse solo y ustedes dicen, wow, ¿cómo hacemos para que un niño crezca y se eduque solo? Que caos pensamos, ¿no? Pero si miramos nuestras vidas nosotros crecimos y aprendimos lo que realmente es importante para nuestras vidas solos. y pasa ahora que uno lleva la adolescencia y termina la secundaria y para que aprendí todo esto y muchas de las cosas que nos hicieron aprender a la fuerza las olvidamos. ¿Seguimos lejos nosotros dos? ¿O bueno? Y la sociedad descarta aquellos que no hayan hecho todo el ciclo completo de estudio también, no hayan hecho un montón de cosas. Bueno, ya más allá del tema burocrático que de que ya está prohibida. Sí, sí, sí. Pero más que nada le voy a pasar por esto y pasar por entender que aquellos que vivimos y que hacemos y que aprendimos y que comprendimos con más fuerza, es aquello que disfrutamos, aquello que nos motivó a nosotros a aprender, aquello que vivimos. Entonces, un ejemplo que siempre damos es... los niños no van a aprender que la tierra gira alrededor del sol, menos que vean las estrellas. ¿Cómo hacen para comprender eso solamente en una lámina? Comenzar a trabajar de forma más activa en la escuela, la educación activa es muy antigua, no es algo nuevo, es algo que se hace hace muchísimo tiempo y nada más que no llegue a las aulas y a eso le sumamos la idea de que no solamente tiene que empezar a trabajar de forma más concreta en el aprendizaje sino que tiene que ser automotivado que el niño busque la motivación. Claro, pero siempre dentro de un entorno social, de colegio, digamos totalmente porque el entorno social es muy importante. y ayudar a que se organizen las ideas, los chicos. La idea es que los mismos niños tengan la capacidad de sacar todo lo que tienen afuera, que es más educación, o sea, educación significa eso, ¿no? Educar es sacar lo que hay dentro. Entonces, ¿que puedan sacar eso? Pero el profesor está ahí para ayudar a organizar eso que se sacó. De alguna forma, los seres humanos, no son los niños desde todos los elementos orgánicos, se podría decir algo que la ciencia le llama que tienen vida necesitan un sostén, necesitan una seguridad de que están vivos y eso es el rol que cumple el profesor, es ese sostén y decir bueno yo estoy acá por cualquier problema pero el proceso lo hace vos, de alguna forma este proceso que fue impuesto desde afuera donde el rol más importante en la educación es el profesor en la escuela tradicional no el niño ni el alumno, este rol es el que nos ha condicionado para un momento, claro. que fue funcional a un periodo histórico en el que era necesario y que hoy ya no social, política y energéticamente también que alguien guíe y hoy ya no es necesario, hoy es necesario empezar a trabajar individualmente que no significa descartar todo y que los niños no van a perder nada. Mantra FM, vibración de la nueva conciencia","Mantra, FM, energy that transforms. but it is necessary to use the form that is in this planet, because that's how we evolve together this planet. That's why I... There are people who consider me a spiritual person, but I'm not at all spiritual. I just remember that level. I'm more social, that's why I try to explain how to understand the processes of 2012 through how to organize the family, education and very land-based aspects. Because all those land-based aspects are also very important. Have you ever thought about having an active participation in social life, like politics for example? I don't think so, but I'm in the plans. But it's not the time anyway. Vote for Matías. No, no. Not yet. No, but it's good, because if you are a person, it's like you. In reality, many of those who We know that within 15 years, 15 years, the year that comes, another kind of politics begins, which is not the same as now. What we are doing to people who know that we have a social situation to fulfill, is to wait for this to fall. Matías, did you meet with Pares in all these years? Pares like you, who remember that they have a clear work to do, and that they are interacting with each other. Yes, and the majority of my age. Because there are many adults who are doing the job, but sometimes they take it as the era of pieces, the work, very structured. So there are people who try to take you to this and make you the glory that everyone knows what you say and no, We must have more tranquility, be more relaxed. And what is more the image we bring young people today? To be more calm, more that doesn't matter so much what happens around us, we will go well the same. I would like you to be the director of the film The forbidden education. Let's let you talk a little bit, because it will not reach us the time, but I would like you to tell us what is your... Well, the link between you and tell us a little about the film. The link goes through what Matías Recien was saying about taking all these processes to the concrete, to the physical structures, as is the school, as is the politics of Cien Recien, that are going to start transforming. In my case, particularly, what we are trying to transform is the school. And the idea itself is to actually take these ideas to the field of education. And when one wants to take them into account that they were there for a long time, we only see them closely. So we are making a movie called the Pro-Life Education. And now we are in the process of finishing the investigation. We travel approximately between seven or eight countries, Latin America, Spain, and looking for projects and contacting educational projects that that they have another way to focus on education. I guess you know better than I do the Waldorf schools. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Not only the children, but also the children. First of all, as we know, all of us are Indigo, let's call them like that. They are children. Sure. So... Not to be a regular. Totally. So... All without exception? There is everything. Indigo is a suit, actually. They are all different dimensions, different galaxies, but here, at some point, they all become a little Indigo suit to make their function. So that's why all the children are... We don't have to say Indigo Cristal, Dora, etc. That's a speciality but it doesn't matter much. In some way, one of the problems that the school came from is this issue of the rotulary. And changing a technical rotulation of psychiatry, science or pedagogy by a spiritual rotulation, we are staying in exactly the same. Yes, totally. Yes, because the term separatist is. The idea is to break with that idea of separation. All are unique and irrepeatable. And that's the idea. Why is the prohibition education The forbidden education... The occasion is forbidden, this type of education, because we don't allow it to be possible. And that's the real question. We don't get the idea that a child can grow up and educate himself. And you say, wow, how do we make a child grow up and educate himself? What a chaos we think, right? But if we look at our lives, we grow up and learn what is really important for our lives alone. And now that one is in adolescence and ends secondary school, why did I learn all this? And many of the things that made us learn to be strong, we forgot them. We are still far away or well. And the discart society, those who have not done the whole full cycle of study, there are a lot of things. Well, beyond the bureaucratic issue that is already forbidden. But more than anything, life goes through this and goes through understanding that those who we live and do and learn and that we understand with more strength is what we enjoy, what motivates us to learn, what we live. An example that we always give is that children will not learn that the earth rotates around the sun unless they see the stars. How do they do to understand that in a lamp? Start working more actively in school. The active education is very old, it's something new. It's something that has been going on for a long time. It's not just that it doesn't reach the classes. And that's what we add to the idea that it doesn't just have to start working more specifically in learning, but it has to be self-motivated. That the child seeks motivation. But always within a social environment, of school, let's say, it's so integrated. Totally, because the social environment is very important. and help them organize the ideas, the ideas. The idea is that the children have the ability to take out everything they have outside. Education means that. Education is to take out what is inside. So they can take that out, but the teacher is there to help organize that, that was taken out. Somehow, human beings, not only children, from all the organic elements, it could be a circus that science calls it, that have life, they need a support, they need a security that is alive. And that is the role that the teacher fulfills. It is that support and say, well, I am here for any problem, but the process is yours. Somehow this process that was imposed from outside, where the most important role in education is the teacher in the traditional school, not the child, nor the student, this role is the one that has conditioned us to I read questions that I feel I have to go, I feel I'm separating myself from my family, things like that. And it's because we have a lot of limits and obstacles that we were introducing ourselves through the school of the children and others. That it's not so bad, because it was necessary at that time. But that's one of the main ideas. The school we're trying to leave is not a bad school, but a school that was functional to a historical period in which it was necessary and that today no longer social, political and energetically also that someone guides and today it is no longer necessary today it is necessary to start working individually what does not mean to discard everything and that the children will not lose anything mantra, FM, vibration of the new consciousness"

The Paper Money Is Going Down! http://www.facebook.com/KBGoldAndSilver http://www.youtube.com/KBGlobalGold http://www.brandvertise.me/iceman/Icegold Skype me: bardur.gunnarsson  The U.S. government is printing money 24/7 to cover the debts. We are about to enter a cycle of hyper-inflation that will devalue every dollar you own... It is now time to begin to think seriously about protecting yourself against coming times. At the same time gold will increase in value! See here:  http://www.staged.com/video?v=OBe  As long as governments and central bankers pursue policies that erode the purchasing power of the currency they manage, gold will be exchanged for that currency at an ever rising price. Gold is the the measuring stick - that illustrates how badly national currencies are being managed. Therefore, unless government policies change - and I see no prospect of that - the price of gold will continue to rise. See here: http://www.staged.com/video?v=23e  Gold is rising against every national currency. The dollar is the world's reserve currency. Therefore, other national currencies are also being debased along with it. The US dollar is now going down a 'black-hole', and pulling every other currency down with it. Here is a funny video explaining some of it: http://www.staged.com/video?v=M4e  You can create a gold and silver savings account right now and start to invest to secure you financial future.

Timmy Taiyo here with no fringe, just facts, financial information. Join me in congratulating the state of Utah, who on March 25, 2011 became the first state in recent times to reclaim its constitutional right to accept gold and silver coins as legal tender. Now the new law which took effect on May 7th is not perfect because it only accepts US government issue coins at their face value. And obviously you would have to be both insane and on crack to pay $50 for something with a gold coin that's valued at over 1500. But it's an important step in the right direction. It's the state of Utah standing up to the Fed and basically slapping it in the face and saying you guys are unconstitutional, you're not federal and you don't have any reserves. And we're not interested in playing your faith-based fiat currency games anymore. Call us crazy, but we would prefer that our money actually had value. Utah, I could not agree with you more, and hats off to you. Now an important distinction to make, the Utah The Utah Legal Tender Act is separate and distinct from the Utah Sound Money Act. Because I've noticed some confusion in the chat rooms and the blogs that I've been reading, the two terms being tossed around interchangeably, but they're actually two very different pieces of legislation. The Utah Legal Tender Act, as the new law is known, quote, recognizes gold and silver coins that are issued by the federal government as legal tender in the state and exempts the exchange of the coins from certain types of state tax liability. Now this is different from an earlier piece of the gold and silver coin issu foreign governments in adi by the US men. So you're Canadian Maple Leafs, South African kugel rands, those s goes further in terms of in precious metals. So now under the gold and silver coins a currency not as a comat a gold and silver US mint co not a commodity. They're again, this point is muc because they only accept them at their fair market value despite but again, it's an important direction. And the state of Minnesota, Idaho, North Carolina, other states are introduc as well. And the same thi scale. Through KB Gold you can own a precious metal back savings account where your currency is exchanged for equivalent in silver and gold. And the gold is no longer just for the rich. Through KB Gold you can own gold in grams, half grams and quarter grams. I'm holding a half gram of pure 999.9 gold. KB is the only mint in the world you can get these from. Now KB was founded in Germany and currently operates throughout Central Europe. And there are right now, very moment in time over 7000 vendors in Germany who accept these KB gold cars as payment. So let's say you're not thrilled about what's happening in the Eurozone, Greece is making you nervous and you don't want to hold your wealth in the form of Euros, you prefer to hold silver and gold. You can take these, those establishments in Germany and pay for your goods and services. And if the Utah Sound Money Act passes or legislation like it, you may soon be able to spend these very KB gold cards in the state of Utah right here in the good old USA. Folks with Utah is doing is big. KB Gold is real big. If you haven't already, check us out at mykbgold.us. Then if you're ready to get going, shoot me a message and I will get you everything that you need. Thanks again for joining me for No Fringe, Just Facts Financial Information. And remember, it is not gold and silver going up. It's the US dollar coming down.","Welcome back. Timmy Taiyo here with no fringe, just facts, financial information.

So they're sheltered from the $20,000 of gold and silver coins. a gold and silver US mint coins are currency, not a commodity. They're not subject to any tax at all.

You don't think that if we were to choose between the path of the Prophet and the path of the Prophet, what would be the right path? All the people who forget the right path are the Prophet. The Prophet and the leader of his enemies, Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, are all the people who are responsible for the right path. And the Prophet is the one who is responsible for the right path. So, you have to choose the path of the Prophet. This is why we don't see the one who is the leader after he is given the right to be in the city of life. The Prophet said to us, peace be upon him, the leader of the city of life, and the leader of the city of life, and the love of the streets. These are the people's suffering before us. We don't know that we are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And we pray to the scholar, may Allah be pleased with him, in the book of Tazir that he will not be forced to do Tazir in the case of Allah. And what is important is that he will be a good person for some children. So, now, we should forget about the matter of his role in the book of Tazir. And the most important thing is that he will be forced to follow the messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. And, most importantly, we should take this example, which is being presented to us.

Chico conoce a chica. Chico construye un palacio a chica con tantas puertas y ventanas como días tiene el año. Chico se arruina para construir el palacio. La novia se enteró que se había quitado todo y se murió pidiendo limon a las calles de Madrid 23 años casi todos los ha pasado entre las paredes de este palacio aunque para Felipe cualquier tiempo pasado fue peor. ¿Qué estaba miedo cuando se quedaba sola? Lo más complicado, calentar todo el edificio en los duros días de invierno. Felipe sigue disfrutando como el primer día de las magníficas vistas desde la cornisa. los frutales que en otro tiempo habitaban el patio. Su memoria resiste a las termitas del tiempo y son sus recuerdos los que devuelven a la vida a la casa grande de Cilleros.","It could not be called otherwise the house is large, a mansion for the blind of three plants of renacent style. Felipe is owner of half the palace, a architecture jewel built in 1863. The garden is not its architecture, but its history. The boy knows the girl, he builds a palace for the girl with so many doors and windows as the day has the year. The boy ruins to build the palace. And in the end, the boy gets ruined. Logically, the girl leaves with another. The owner of this palace ended up asking for limosna. She has a lot of legend, but what is true is that the father of Felipe bought half of the palace for 60,000 pesos. I was 23 years old, almost all of them have passed through the walls of this palace. Although for Felipe any time passed was worse. Yes, but I like it more now because I could not go out alone, maybe in the street, and now I can go with bags to criticize you. Now I do what I'm given, I could not go out without media, I could not live, I did not like that. I had to go with a girl of service. Were you afraid when you were alone? No, no, no, no. That it is for a woman alone. Here, this house, is that he said, there was a man here who worked with a nephew and he told me, I, sir, I'm going to tell you one thing. I'm a man who stays in the countryside, that I'm phenomenal wherever he wants, but in the big house, I could not sleep alone. I'm in the big house. Yes. How can you live alone and sleep in the big house? The most complicated thing is to heat the whole building in the hard days of winter. Felipe continues to enjoy the first day of the magnificent views from the cornice. the fruits that in another time lived in the patio. Who does not eat and drinks beer, sparrows spit and kiss an old woman, nor eat nor drink, nor spit nor kiss. His memory resists the ends of time and are his memories those who return to life to the great house of cillers."

I'm growing marijuana in my yard I'm growing marijuana in my yard. I've got little pots of pot - Spread out all over the lot Cuz I'm growing marijuana in my yard.    I got the seed from Mexico Stuck it in some dirt and let it grow Put it in my garden with my peppers and my peas And I get all the smoke I need for free.    I'm growing marijuana in my yard, I'm growing marijuana in my yard. We keep it where no one can see - So let's keep this 'tween you and me, But I'm growing marijuana in my yard.    Yes, I'm growing marijuana in my yard, But I can't tell my boss or I'll get fired. I don't grow much just what I use - I work all day and when I'm through I smoke some marijuana from my yard.    Now the policeman wants to talk to me He says, How you gonna smoke up all that weed? He says, Money's what you're in it for - Don't you know we're in a war? Now I'm gonna haul your ass downtown with me.    And I said, Hey, man, what is it to you? How do I infringe on what you do? I beg your pardon, if you're offended by my garden But I just can't grow Prozac in my yard.    So I grow my own medicine in my yard. I give some to my neighbor for his heart. I share it with my grandma, who keeps it from her son, Cuz we all know that stuff's against the law.    Now there's nothing growing in my yard Cuz the cops took all my land and both my cars. Now I have to buy my pot - From a teen-ager in a parking lot Who's growing marijuana in his yard.    Anyone can grow it in their yard I could show you how, it ain't hard.

I'll come back to your coin later, lads. Havana, Kingston, and the pirate haven, Natsaw. We've decided to make enemies harder and deadlier, so you'll definitely want to use stealth when facing tough challenges. The lush foliage and dense environment provide many opportunities for stealth and to allow you to stalk your prey. But you'll still have to be careful, as the Scarred's Light will catch you if you don't avoid it. Tell me about the beat. Most drunk to stand. That will suit our purpose. But for a moment I die there. Bloody savages. I have no fear, soldier. This... You'll be able to upgrade how many guns you carry and the guns themselves. Then you can use them to do different combos alone or with other weapons. We've also added a free-aim shooting for those who want that extra precision. A very important feature for us is the seamlessness you see here. Being able to go from land to ship without a break in the immersion. It allows you to have free agency and how you explore and play in this world. AC3 was a tease on naval combat. We pushed and deepened the experience of new enemies and new weapons. As we approach this man of war, will see its mortar attack in heavy shot. All new weapons that you will be able to find and upgrade on your ship, the Jackdaw. Another new weapon, the fire barrels. Very useful to hamstring a chasing enemy. The seamless concept also extends to boarding. You can board and capture virtually every ship in this world, but the way you do it matters. The angle you approach it, the speed, using swivel of guns to weaken the crew or rope swing to go in guns blazing, even jumping in the water and swimming to the other side for a stealth attack, it's all up to you. We hope you enjoyed this demo. We have much more to show you in the coming months.","Hi, this is Ashraf Ismail, Game Director for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

Traditionally Spanish is a mythical characteristic being, a bogeyman of the 21st century. and in others produce countless tentacles. Perhaps what led him to turn it into such a popular figure on the internet and anti-frozen they would identify it until today. His head completely unobtrusive of any kind, his whole skin white, and a formal black suit. It is not known much and there is no specific information in the world where it was created, but its objective and habitat are clear. He prefers to kidnap children and is seen commonly before the disappearance of a multiple child It seems to prefer to fill streets of Nieblau, several forests to hide easily. It should be noted that children can see it while no adult can. Children have nightmares or dreams that involve the Slender Man before disappearing. Many of these stories are always taken as very active imaginations. Its appearance allows him to dive between the trees, so it is particularly associated with this type of scenario. This last theory could be refolded by the fact that the Slenderman has appeared or has, on all sides, from Japan, Norway and America, by naming some. This monster was immediately associated with the Slenderman, who was the first to be killed by the Slenderman. The forest and the children appear in the dark and always taking in several forests and rivers near. It has been reported that they like to take in open windows and that they tend to walk in front of lonely motorists on desolate roads. The folklore that surrounds it tells stories in which children disappear when playing near a forest to reappear as horribly motivated bodies. They also associate themselves with the fires, making them appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the dark and the children appear in the children appear in the dark and the children appear and several photos just drawn between the smoke of some house that disappeared between the flames.

I get out, there was this phone booth and I called him on the private line. What the hell are you doing? Stopping talking in the middle of a commercial. Don't you realize people are paying for that? And he said, oh, I just had this funny little idea. There was some kind of a creepy little bug went across the script and I called it an amoeba. And I said, well, damn it, I'll never do that again. He says, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, so that was that. Well, people went wild about the amoebas. I mean, people started calling him an invitation. What do you mean? An amoeba? And so on. So I thought, oh hey, this is good. People, really? So we started inventing things. Ladies and gentlemen, the amoebas are still loose everywhere. Ladies with butterfly nets in Pasadena have signed up to catch them. That was one. Okay, next report. Here's an amoeba report. Ladies and gentlemen, the amoebas are still being chased by the ladies from Pasadena. And we just saw one of them go over the passage in a freeway. Something like that. We did all these things. Well, the FCC called the local FCC guy. And he says, what are you doing? He said, people are telling me that the health thing, they can't get nobody that's sick and can't get in because everybody's calling about what am I doing from a neighbor, a bunch of men, and all of this thing.

And the whole of the next day was final. We chased him out of the city. We saved him. And I said, and they're heading for San Francisco. And the idea there was our station in San Francisco. in Francisco, we had three stations, we're going to pick up the amoeba thing there. Well, by the end of that day, the FCC called me back again. This guy said, hey, you got to take it off. He said, I mean, the city is stopped because of this. And I said, you're kidding me. I said, people can't be that stupid. And he said, well, guess again. So, okay, ladies and gentlemen, we had this amoeba thing all day, and amoeba is a little insane. You can't even see and not going to hurt anybody. And we apologized for this, but da-da-da-da-da. There was a station in a newspaper in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Herald Express.

Her iddia sahibinin de delil getirmesi lazım. Afak'i konuşmakla bu işler olmuyor. Bugün İslam dünyasının büyük bir bölümünde ve Türkiye'mizin bu güzel memleketimizin, bu güzel cümhuriyetimizin büyük bir bölümünde, büyük bir bölümünde minarelerde okunan ezanlar Peygamber Efendimizin okuduğu, okutturduğu, Peygamber Efendimizin zamanındaki okunan ezan değildir. Ezanı değiştirmişlerdir. Evet. Ezanı el sokmuşlardır. Ezanı noksanlaştırmış, fazlalaştırmışlardır. Bakın ezan da Peygamber Efendimiz döneminde felah sonrasında Peygamber Efendimiz'in zamanında ezan olduğu gibi okunuyordu. Birinci halife döneminde ezan olduğu gibi okunuyordu. İkinci halife döneminin bir noktasına kadar yani hidri 23. seneye kadar ezan bu şekilde devam ediyordu ama ikinci halifenin hilafetinin bir döneminde müezzin geliyor, halifeyi sabah namazına uyandırmak için. Esselat esselat ey halife diye sesleniyor, Halife uyanmıyor. Sesleniyor uyanmıyor. Bunu sesleyen şahıs, ''Essalatu kheirim minen nawm ya Khalife'' Yani namaz uykudan hayırlıdır. ''Kalk namaza gel'' Halife bir uyanıyor bakıyor ki ''kapın ağzında kendisini sesleyen, ''Essalatu kheirim minen nawm'' diyor. Sesliyor onu diyor sabah ezanı. Bundan sonra sabah ezanı okuduğun zaman Şimdi bakın Yeşer Bey. Sadece sabah azanlar mı bütün ezanlar? 23171'de diyor ki Bilal Peygamberin Hayatı döneminde ezan okudu. şey nedir? Pilal dedi ki, Peygamber'in mevzini ben Peygamber'in zamanında ezan okudum, Ebu Bekri'nin zamanında ezan okudum. Çünkü Peygamber benim veli yinni imetimdi ve Peygamber'den işittim ki, İslam'da, Peygamber buyurdu ki, Ey Bilal İslam'da cihad dışında hiçbir amel senin amelin kadar faziletli değildir. Peygamber bana bunu dediği için ben cihada gidiyorum. Bakın bir Bilal ezan okumamak için cihada gitmeyi tercih etti. Niye Bilal Peygamber zamanda okudu? Hatta birinci halife zamanda okudu da, ikinci halife zamanda ezan okumadı. Çünkü Bilal bakıyordu. İkinci halife, Peygamberin ezanı değiştiriyordu. Bakalım. Yine 23174 numaralı hadiste diyor ki Bakın burada sabah ezanındaki cümleyi söylüyor. Bilal ezan verirken veya başka bir son bir rivayet arzideyim buradan. Az önce söylediğim. Türkiye'de, şu anda biz Türkiye'de oturmuşuz Türkiye'de konuşuyoruz. Türkiye'de minarelerde okunan sabah ezanları özellikle sabah ezanları ve diğer ezanlar sabah ezanında bir ekleme var yer değiştirme var diğer ezanlardan da hayale, kıyırıl, envalin, eksil mes'o. Burada parantesinde bunu da söyleyeyim. Fıkık kitaplarında ezan bölümünü açsınlar, baksınlar. Ezan cümlelerinin arasında bazı zikirleri söylemek sünnettir. Bazı zikirleri. Mesela Allah'u Hakk'ber dedikten sonra dört defa bazı zikirleri söylemek. Muhammed Resulullah dedikten sonra bazı zikirleri söylemek ezanı da sünnettir. Biz diyoruz ki ehl-i beytfıkhına göre, aleyyen veliyullah ezanın bir cüz'i değil. Ezanın bir parçası değildir. ezan'da söylemesi sünnettir. Ancak bugün Şiha'nın etiketi olduğundan Şiha'nın kimliği olduğundan dolayı ezan okurken de onun söylenmesi gerekir. Ama Kadirhum'da, Hz. Selman'da okumuştur onu. O da ayrı bir konu. Hz. Selman'ın da Kadirhum'da o hutbeden sonra... Var da bunlar şihar yuvayetlerinde vardır. Okuyup Hanya'la Şiha'yı Eşhübhane-i Emre'l-Mumun, Ali-Yen-i Vel-Yurla dediği de yazıyor.","Every claim is a claim, and every claim is a claim. It is not possible to talk about the affaqih. Today, in a large part of the Islamic world, in our country, our country, our community, in a large part of the world, in a large part of the world, the ezzans that are recited in the minarets, the ezzans that the Prophet recited, They have changed the ezan. They have put the ezan in the hands. They have increased the ezan by a point. Look, in the ezan, there is a sentence, They took out this sentence from the grave. They put the sentence of the Prophet in the grave of the morning. As the time of our Prophet, the Prophet was reciting as if he was a treasure. He was reciting as if he was a treasure during the first caliphate. Until the first point of the second caliphate, i.e. until the 23rd year of the century, the treasure was continuing in this way. But during the first period of the caliphate of the second caliphate, the muazzin came to wake the caliph up for the morning prayer. As-salat, as-salat, O caliph, He doesn't wake up. He doesn't wake up. The person who hears this says, Now look at the verse of the Prophet. The first verse is from the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of the verse of 23171 says that Bilal read the prayer in the period of the Prophet. What is the meaning of this? Pilal said, I read the prayer in the time of the Prophet Abu Bakr. Because the Prophet was my slave and I heard from the Prophet that there is no other religion except the jihad in Islam. The Prophet said, O Pilal, there is no other religion except jihad in Islam. The Prophet said this to me, so I am going to jihad. Bilal preferred to go to jihad to not read the ezan. Why did Bilal read the ezan in the time of the Prophet? He even read it in the time of the first caliph, but he did not read the ezan in the second caliphate. Because Bilal was looking at it, the second caliph changed the ezan of the Prophet. Look, again in the hadith number 274, it says He was saying, Hayya ala khayri al-amal. He was saying this in the morning. He was saying, Hayya ala khayri al-amal. Or, another last story from here, from the Ummah of Kenzul. He says, Prophet Muhammad's death was the second caliphate period. As-Salaatu Khayr-ul-Minna-Naw said, and Khalife-Umer said, he heard this in the morning. Look, this is in the treasure box. I will give another source and pass it immediately. The book written in Zerkan-i Muwattah is in a rare page 25. Imam Malik, Imam Malik of the Malik Masih, writes these events in the Azan section. Therefore, I want to say this. We are talking about Turkey now. We are talking about the morning prayers that are performed in Turkey. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer.

And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a prayer in the morning prayer. And there is a Let our brothers open the chapter of ezan in the book of Fuku. Let them see. Some zikrs are a sunnah among ezan sentences. Some zikrs. For example, after saying Allah al-Kiber, it is a sunnah to say some zikrs. We say that according to the Ahlul Bayt Fıkh, Aliyan wa Liullah is not a juz'i of ezan. It is not a part of ezan. but today, because of the etiquette of Shia, because of Shia's identity, he has to be told about it. But in Qadirhum, in Hazrat Selman, he has read it, he has a different subject. In Hazrat Selman, after the Ahudb, he has read it, he has read it in the Shia verses."

I'm going to go through our parts materials here and then we'll go through the technique on how to really do it correctly. Starting off we've got our purple primer. This is what you prime the PVC with. This is absolutely necessary whether or not you're doing new or new to new or new to old repair work. This is the blue glue. This is Christie's brand. This is my preferred brand. ratcheting PVC cutters. I like to have a tape measure and either a sharpie or a pencil with me because I think it makes a lot more precision work. And obviously we have our pipe and our fittings. So you start off by cutting your PVC to length and then you take your primer and you want to make sure to apply a liberal amount of primer. At least two inches back up so that when you're standing up you can see that you definitely, definitely did it. The pipe gets primer and inside the fitting gets primer. The edge of the fitting also gets primer. This face gets primer as well. Then after that's done its job, you come through with a good amount of glue and about half the distance of the primer, you apply the glue nice and thick, nice and consistent all the way around. The PVC fitting also gets glue. And when you put them in, this is really important. You want to make sure that it seats all the way down and that you rotate the pipe to where you get a nice consistent coat all the way around. Then you do a quarter turn back. That should make sure you get this really nice consistent, beautiful weld. Not going to leak. Now it's worth mentioning that a lot of guys who do a lot of this work use a respirator. Because if you don't, you might be called chemical new United Salsons metal Salsons. That's right. So yeah, it's not so necessary if you are just doing a small repair job. But if you're going to be doing it all day, definitely make sure to bring a respirator. Another thing that's worth mentioning is that sometimes you're going to be working on pipes that are old and trusty and have glue dripping down on them. What I like to do is keep sandpaper on me. Just sand that stuff off so that the old original pipes that are slipping out into new fittings seat all the way down. That's really important for a good hole. That's pretty much where most of the strength comes from in the glue. Anyway, yeah, just take your time. Wait about a half an hour before you charge. I typically wait about a half an hour before you charge. before I charge the line, the bigger the pipe, the longer you want to wait. And yeah, if you have any leaks, just recut it and then do these same techniques and just the cleaner and more secure you can make your welds the better chance that they're going to hold. Anyhow, I hope this was helpful and we'll see you guys next time.","Hi guys, today we're going to be doing a little bit of PVC welding, also called self-advelving.

Because if you don't, you might be called chemical new United States metal systems. That's right. So yeah, it's not so necessary if you are just doing a small repair job, but if you're going to be doing it all day, definitely make sure to bring a respirator. Another thing that's worth mentioning is that sometimes you're going to be working on pipes that are old and trusty and have glue dripping down on them. What I like to do is keep sandpaper on me. Just sand that stuff off so that the old original pipes that are slipping out into new fittings seat all the way down. That's really important for a good hole. That's pretty much where most of the strength comes from in the glue. Anyway, yeah, just take your time. Wait about a half an hour before you charge. I typically wait about a half an hour before you charge. before I charge the line, the bigger the pipe, the longer you want to wait. And yeah, if you have any leaks, just recut it and then do these same techniques and just the cleaner and more secure you can make your welds the better chance that they're going to hold. Anyhow, I hope this was helpful and we'll see you guys next time."

Hoy es el primer día sin partidos y siento como que me acabo de despertar de un coma mundialista. No entiendo nada. Todos hablan de un tal Tito que parece que era custodio de Ford, pero que Richard lo echó porque tomó mucho protagonismo en el bailando y ahora el guarda espalda que lo más colgado que Winnie Houston. Pero mejor que te lo explique el mismísimo Tito en toda su elocuencia. Volverías a ideas del sur ya de la mano de la mole. ¿Trabajarías para la mole? ¿Estás dolido? ¿Te has ilusionado? ¿Me haces una molesta toda esta situación? Me tiró el... Ajá, ok, Tito es modo, lo cual complica un poco más las cosas. Es que Tito en realidad nunca hacía nada. Salía como custodio de fuerte en silencio y Tienel y lo deliraba. Mejor pregunté molest su ex jefe como es este... Asuntito. ¡Fuah! Richard es más incusto que lo referí de Blatter y pensar que en este momento el pobretito está en un oscuro gimnasio recordando cuando lo sacaba en brazos a Ford después de las funciones. ¡Adiós, mundo patoba y cruel! ¿No quieres hablar con nadie? ¿Te molesta esto mediático que te hizo a lo que te llevó Ford? Anavela nuevamente consiguió lo imposible. Un testimonio del tito auténtico. Eser Arrodesio, Grand Bless y Quack. No, en serio. Hasta ahora el único partido que me enganchó fue la cruzada entre los intrusos y los canosos por escuchar La Voz de Tito. es un par de palabras de Tito que no es Tito el que habla de... ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No! ¡No ¿Cómo te vas? de la bolsa.

Today is the first day without games and I feel like I just woke up from a world-class coma. I don't understand anything! Everyone talks about a Tito who seems to be a Ford custodian but Richard did it because he took a lot of protagonists in the dance and now the guard of the back is the most hung-up guy in Houston. But it's better that he explains the same Tito to you in all his eloquence. Are you hurt? Are you excited? Are you mad at all this situation? I don't know. I don't know. Okay, Tito is a model, which complicates things a little more. Tito actually never did anything. He came out as a fort in silence and he had it and he was delirious. Let's ask his ex-chef better, how is this... Assumptito. I'm going to talk to him today, to tell him what I'm doing. This weekend, in my time of fortune, he told me yes, because I knew what I was thinking about, because I had to do a presentation. People get married, it's incredible. I saw him dancing and thanks to me, thanks to Marcelo, I have the interest. This was a presentation, I said I didn't want to tell anyone. If Marcelo brings it here? No, I don't think so. You're going to bring it here? I don't think so, because I miss the people in my person, and I look at it. I'm going to get up. Richard is more unfair than I referred to him as Blatter. And to think that at this moment the poor guy is in a dark gym remembering when he took out his arm from Fort after the functions. Oh my God, world, Patoba and cruel. You don't want to talk to anyone? Do you mind this media that Fort took you? Annabella again got the impossible A testimony of the authentic Tito That was Rodesio! Grand bless and quack! No, seriously, until now the only game that hooked me was the cross between the intrusions and the canoes for listening to... Tito's voice! This is a couple of words from Tito, which is not Tito the one who speaks. No! I can't believe it! It's a voice from Tito! Despite the fact that some idiot said that what he had put right now is an introduction to a paparazzi recording that the voice was not Tito's. Then Tito started when they got it. This voice from Tito is starting to obsess me. Will you talk? Because so far he has less desire to communicate than Bielsa. Tito, I'm Camilo, we're here, going out to the air in the Viana Canosa's frame. How are you? How are you, Tito? I'm fine. But why are you going wrong? Because of all this... Now that Tito's real calm, we can finally hear his beautiful voice. Sing the guacahuaca, Tito! Tito, Tito, Tito, you have a beautiful voice. What Bremer said is that the anabolicos tune your voice and they kick your testicles. How strange the world is, but watch out, in this globalized planet the news runs fast. Now in Johannesburg they turned it around to Pazman and instead of talking about Totty, they talk about Tito."

Voy a darle guardar configuración, vamos a hacer página la actualizamos, vamos a buscar nuestra imagen, bueno no está apareciendo, a ver, pues que pasó, actualizado, paisaje, mente, peso, publicado, de repente no lo hemos publicado, perdón no lo hemos publicado, se nos escapó, vamos a le guardar configuración, Ahora si, revisemos mi página, la actualizo. Cada plantilla se configura de manera diferente. No crea que lo que estoy haciendo va a ser igual para todas las plantillas que ustedes utilicen. Les recomiendo descargar las plantillas y empiecen a practicar con algunas para que tengan una idea mucho más amplia de cómo se pueden trabajar con ellas en droopa. pueden cambiar el fábricón, pueden cargar su propio fábricón, que es el fábricón, es esta imagen que sale en la parte superior con el video de Drupal pueden cambiarlo y personalizarlo, bueno les he tratado de dar una idea de cómo trabajar con una plantilla, cada plantilla tiene una administración diferente, algunas cosas son generales como estas, pero en cuanto a las imágenes pueden variar mucho, las funciones también, bueno eso fue todo, gracias.","I'm going to download the zip package that weighs 1.44 megas I give it a clip I'm going to take it to my desktop, start download, perfect here is the package now how do we install this new template in Drupal we go to the administrator and we click on appearances and it says there is a link to install a new topic, please give it a click, it presents a selector, I'm going to choose the template that is in my desktop and we wait for a moment to install it perfect want to go to the administrator the topics we give there click perfect to see we observe we are in appearance but the theme is deactivated so the first thing we are going to do now is activate it when we click on the link it already appears in the upper part now that it is already activated I am going to establish it as predetermined I start to see how it is presented, we wait a moment, here it is, system management course of content, I hope that the systems are in a dynamic way, in the same way as we have seen in the previous video we can configure that template, I go to the administrator, I go to appearance, options, suddenly now we do not want it to be shown, a new tab that has been opened to see the model and here to see the administrator, I open and now we don't want the logo to look like a slogan, we just remove the logo and the logo of the site. I'm going to the bottom and save configuration. You can upload your logo, put a much shorter title, if in this case it is just an example. What else do we have here? Here is the article, very well. We have a banner with images. I will show you the image that I have in the description 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide 320 wide I will save the image, I will look for the image I will review the image and the image of the image You can change the fabric, you can load your own fabric, which is the fabric, it is this image that comes out of the upper part of the Vitegrupal, you can change it and customize it. I have tried to give you an idea of how to work with a template, each template has a different instruction, some things are general like this, but as for the images, they can vary a lot, the functions are good. Well, that was all, thank you."

I'm really happy to do this and I always wanted this case. It's just really neat and it's like a case that you can like slide out with your iPhone in a physical keyboard instead of the virtual keyboard on the iPhone. I think it's really neat. Let's get into it. So this is gonna run you $80. Yeah it's pricey but I think it's gonna be pretty cool. I'm not sure. See sorry you guys about the wind. I didn't have that good lighting inside so I want to do it outside. It's peaceful out here. quick guide, it teaches you all the little codes and all that cool stuff, how to pair it and all that. And then you're going to get the actual case itself. Oh, that's cool. It comes with a phone iPhone. I've never seen that before. Huh. It could trick someone, I guess. Usually it's cardboard, but it's getting into the case. So there's this little sticker here and then I guess the serial number. So basically this looks pretty cool. It's backlit, which is really nice. Say if you're typing in the dark, it'll work really nice. So this is the unboxer. the box wave keyboard buddy I'm gonna be doing a review on this probably tomorrow two days um it looks really sleek it does add a little bit of bulk as you guys see there but um I think it's gonna be pretty cool and I have a lot of cool videos got for you guys in the future and this is unboxing of the keyboard buddy and the only thing else it comes with is it looks like a micro USB to USB just to charge it and sync it that's pretty cool but um yeah that's that I think it lasts about like two days three days or maybe I think yeah two days three days That's what I heard rumors about bomb that's unboxing of the keyboard buddy case, um, please rate comment subscribe Tell me if you like this case or if you don't like it and why and as always stay funky.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. The reason we are here tonight is to celebrate the launch of the latest in the lineup of the greatest and most powerful gaming systems on the planet. Of course, that being Alienware. When you put Alienware's name on it, there's a lot of expectation. Twitter hits in the last 30 minutes, man through the roof. So Frank, take it away. Tell us what we're about to see tonight. All about listening to our customers. And what we're here to show you today is the latest combination of gathering all of that feedback and what we've done for you with them. give you a product that's going to be smaller and more versatile than you've ever seen from Alienware before. So that's why we're very excited this evening to give you a first look at our latest product, the Alienware X51. This machine is going to be available to you for a price point of starting at $6.99. That's a good price. Mind-blowing. It's absolutely incredible. You could not build your own PC that will be at that same performance point for that much money. So come on, let's go ahead and check this out. As you can see people having a great time here. I've been to some Alienware events before you know and they're always really fun. Got buttons. Good job. Now I've got station set up all over the place as well. But first and foremost I think that it's only appropriate that we have you take a quick tour of the Hummer that is sitting here. Inside there are four Alienware Aurora systems. This is one of the top brands so it's always good to come out to an event where we can kind of look at the brand I saw the big box and I was like, oh, it's going to be a big old thing. I've got a stuff under a desk. No, this I can carry. If I want to go to a friend's house, go to a land party or something, I can easily move it. That's what really impressed me about this new unveiling. It'll be nice to be able to play games on my big, big screen TV. I usually do hook up my computer to my TV just because that's what nerds do. I think it's perfect to put it in the bedroom or in the office. I think it's great. It really is the small sort of details that make it. The Alienware that switches the multicolor, the Alienware head spinning when you move it from vertical to horizontal is a really nice touch. It's very subtle, but it's super cool. It's neat how you can get a lot of power in such a small little box. It's ready to go, it games really well, but yet it actually will allow you to upgrade over time. This actually allows you just to go to any store and buy what you need. Having the ability to upgrade the machine, on the fly and just being able to basically tweak whatever you want. Like that's excellent. It says something that you're actually interested in what the community thinks about your product. And all of a sudden bam, you get it. That's pretty cool.","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

Craig and Nappy (Food Network) redeem themselves after their appearance on Bobby's Dinner Battle by showing you how to make Pork Braciole. After having nightmares of their failed pork dish Craig and Nappy decide it's time to give it one more shot. Directed and Edited by Ron Zember (http://www.youtube.com/ronzember)  How to make:  1 pork tenderloin, butterflied and pounded flat 3-4 thin slices of mortadella (can substitute 5-6 thin slices of prosciutto) 4-5 slices of slicing provolone (can substitute mozzarella) 1/4 lb spinach (stemmed, leaves only) 2 eggs beaten 1/3 to 1/2 cup of dry white wine 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for sauteing  salt and pepper to taste 2-3 feet of cooking string  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Heat a pan (nonstick, preferably) on medium high heat.  Once hot, add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan to coat the bottom and the edges.  Beat the eggs together and add the beaten mixture to the pan.  Move the pan around to make the egg as circular and flat as possible.  Cook the egg through on both sides.  Once cooked, remove the egg and let it cool on a flat surface.    On another flat surface, lay out your flattened pork tenderloin.  First, add the egg onto the top of the pork, then layer on the spinach, the mortadella and lastly the cheese.  Roll the pork with its ingredients up into a long log-like shape.  With the cooking string, truss the meat so to ensure none of the ingredients fall out during the cooking process.  Salt and pepper the pork to taste.  Heat a pan large enough to contain the rolled/stuffed pork on high.  Once hot, add the pork turning the pork every 2-3 minutes until browned on all sides.    Add the wine and reduce by 1/4.  Cover and put the pork into the oven.  Cook for approximately 35-40 minutes.    To serve, remove the string and cut 1-2 inch slices of the pork.  Spoon over remaining cooking liquid and serve.","Guys, Bobby flay, Bloomberg, Recipes, Dessert, Epic meal time, Greg, Greg Napolitano, Napolitano, Craig and Nappy, Two, Mayonnaise, Harlem shake, Redemption, Truss, Craig Gambardella, Craig, Braciole, Valentine's Day, tutorial, Pork, Cooking, mayonnaise, Valentine's, Tenderloin, How-to, Recipe, Tiramisu, ron zember, How to make, Bbq, Nappy, food humor, Food battle, Food Network, food, battle, italian, Kitchen, Mayo, Thanksgiving, Bobby's Dinner Battle, Valentine's Day Dessert",5713,16,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/rTa3-dDREv4.mp3,"Serving raw pork to the rest of the table is a huge misstep the brajole Great idea.

Dann kommen so Sätze, wenn die muslim nach dem Quran lehme, dann wird es ganz gefährlich für uns. Der Quran ist die Anweisung von Allah, das allzeit gültige Wort des Gottes Allah. Das nicht zu hinterfragen ist, dass zeitlos gültig ist. Und schon haben wir ein Problem, Freunde. Lehst in euch noch mal in Ruhe wirklich Vers für Vers zu und durch. Was ist eigentlich Ihr Ziel? Das verstehe ich doch. Gut, dann lese ich den Quran. Ja, und dann machst du dir Gedanken und... Ich sag Ihnen zu 100 Prozent, das meine Meinung genau so bleiben geht jetzt. Aber wenn... Aber so etwas im Fastenmonat zu bringen, das finde ich echt eine Frechheit. Warum? Weil es der Heilige Monat ist und so welche Sachen kommen immer im Fastenmonat. Das habe ich schon total oft bemerkt. Das kommt immer im Fastenmonat. Ja, so welche Diskussionen sind immer im Fastenmonat. Nein! Das Fastenmonat interessiert mich doch gar nicht. Fastest du denn? Natürlich fast ich. Von morgens bis abends nichts essen. Man zog sogar. Bis Sonnenuntergang, ja. Ja, ich meine, das kann ja jeder machen. Das Ramadan jetzt ist, interessiert mich überhaupt nicht. Jetzt ist die Diskussion wegen Sarah zu ziehen. Das hat jetzt mit dem Ramadan nichts zu tun. Ich weiß sowieso, dass sie die ganzen Sachen rausschneiden werden, das wir gesagt haben. Was mich stört? Wenn im Ramadan in Schulen, wo mehrheitlich muslimische Schüler sind, muslimische Schüler, Das ist in meiner Schule nicht so... Die Tisten ins Essen rein, das ist passiert schon in Deutschland. Wann ist das bitte schön passiert? Das habe ich noch nie in meinem Leben mitbekommen. Auf meiner Schule sind 1500 Leute und das habe ich noch nie in meinem Leben. Achso, das habe ich noch... ARD. Achso, ich schaue jeden Tag Nachrichten und ich habe das noch nie gesehen. Hast du den Film gesehen, Kampf im Klassenzimmer? Nein. Ein Film, genau. Ein Film ist es. Ein Film, ein Film. Sie haben Film gesagt. Ein Dokumentationsfilm. An einer Schule in Essen aufgeboten. Ein Film haben Sie gesagt. Das habe ich noch nie gehört, das Muslime. Schau Sie lachen doch selbst. Ist das so lächerlich. Ja natürlich. Wenn ich Sie angreifen würde, Sie greifen gerade meinen Glauben an. Sie greifen gerade meinen Glauben an. Warum greif ich? Warum fühlst du dich angegriffen? Weil Sie sagen, Muslim haben christlichen Kindern ins Essen gespuckt, weil Ramadan ist, das habe ich noch nie gehört. Das habe ich noch nie in meinem Leben gehört. Ja, das hat die ARD in einem Dokumentationsfilm gehört. Bitte, du hast es in zwei Wochen ausgeschrieben. Ich habe es nicht in meinem Leben jemals gehört. Das war ein Film. Jetzt kommen Sie mit einer Dokumentations. Ja, ne? Ja, da. Eine Dokumentation. Und wie heißt die Dokumentation? Von whom ist es? Und wann ist die Dokumentation? Von 1933 bis 1945, oder was? Ach komm, in der Schule in Essen aufgenommen. Und ihr kennst auch die Probleme von der Rüttlischule in Berlin. Das sind doch keine Sachen, die unbekannt sind, oder? dass wir Probleme haben in den Schulen. Ja, in den Schulen, aber ist das alles, was mit Muslime tun? Ausländer sind schon ganz schön. Es sind natürlich wie Ausländer. Es wurden auch schon an einer... Sagen Sie doch einfach, schreiben Sie da nicht hin, Danke Tino, schreiben Sie dahin raus, Ausländer. Das wäre einfach am besten. Das wäre am besten. Ich sage Sie doch ehrlich, warum haben Sie da Danke Tino draufstehen? Was sollen Sie damit sagen? Wir müssen mal langsam über den Islam diskutieren. Ja, diskutieren wir jetzt. Was im Namen des Islam getötet wird, es werden Zwangshailaten vollzogen Es werden Frauen verschleiert. Es werden viele Dinge nicht geführt, die aus unserer Sicht nicht akzeptiert sind. Wir wollen eine freie, aufgeklärtene, liberale Gesellschaft. Aber nicht solche Sachen, wie sie teilweise von des Namen gefordert haben. Oder denken Sie, Sie haben das Recht dazu in die Kultur, in die Religion anderer Leute einfach so mal reinzugreifen? Wir haben das Recht dazu. Ich weiß gar nicht, dass du nicht beundrigst. Ich habe doch vorhin gesagt, alle Ausländer sind herzlich willkommen. Ich habe nicht gesagt, dass die Muslime nicht mehr kommen. Ich finde es nicht frechheit. Ich finde es echt nicht frechheit. Aber dieser Satz, wenn Muslime nach dem Koran leben, das werde ich echt nicht vergessen. Da wird es gefährlich für uns. Da wird es gefährlich für uns. Ich finde es echt nicht frechheit. Wie viele Pfarrer haben Kindervergewaltigt, aber da wird nichts gesagt. Ich muss ganz herzlich danken. Der hat nicht nur negative Äußerungen oder gegenüber Muslime, sondern auch gegen den anderen Ausländern genauso geäußert. Danke Sie, das auch oder was? Nein, nein, nein, er hat gesagt die meisten. Das ist wohl nicht integriert für uns so etwas. Was er gesagt hat ist, wir erleben es in der zweiten und dritten Generation von Zuwanderern, dass Sie meistens... Das ist das zweite Generation. Ja, lass uns erst mal ausreden. Ja, dass die meisten dann gut integriert sind, Deutsch sprechen und auch in der Bildung gut vorankommen. Wie ihr zum Beispiel, ja. Aber in der Masse, das heißt jetzt nicht, dass es bei dir so ist, aber von der Masse her gesehen, haben wir bei muslimischen Zuwanderern in der zweiten und dritten Generation Diese Erfolge nicht. Es ist statistisch belegt. Es sind Fakten. Immigrationsbericht der Bundesregierung. Da müssen wir doch drüber reden. Oder? Warum ist es so? Wir wollen doch kauen, dass es besser wird. Warum bist du immer gleich so radikal? Nein, weil sie das sind. Wir wollen doch, dass es in der vierten Generation besser wird. Also. Und dann müssen wir doch schauen, woran es ist. Du bist hübsch, du sprichst Deutsch, du bist eine voll integrierte... Das ist echt... Ich habe mich nicht nötig. Sie haben sich einfach alle Ausländer, nee, die Ausländer sollen drin bleiben, aber die Muslimen sollen bitte rausgeben. Danke schön!","If Muslims live after the Quran, it will be very dangerous for us. And then you make your mind... I'm telling you, 100% of my opinions are exactly the same. But to bring something like that into fasting month, that's really a failure. Why? Because it's the holy month and such things always come into fasting month. I've noticed that already. No, that's why it's like this now. Because it's always coming into fasting month. Yes, such discussions are always in fasting month. No! Fasting month doesn't interest me at all. Do you fast? Of course I fast. From morning until evening, nothing to eat. Even a pizza. Even a sunroof. I think it's good. I've never been in my school. I've never been in my school.

I didn't say that the Muslims are not in the Muslim world. I just said that. All foreigners are welcome only the Muslims. What do you mean? I don't remember. Nice to have you, Michael. I really like your area. I'm Sabrina. And you? Maria. Are you happy with the discussion? We should be the same, right? I think it's a crime. But I'll show you what Islam is about. But this sentence, when Muslims live after the Koran, I won't forget that. Because it's dangerous for us. I think it's a crime. How many fathers have raped children? But there is nothing to say. He didn't thank them. He didn't just have negative statements or I don't know, against Muslims, but against other foreigners. Thank you very much! This is not a success. It is statistically proven. It is facts. Immigration report of the federal government. We have to talk about it. Why is it like this? Why are you always so radical? No, because they are. We want it to be better in the 4th generation. I was born in America, my cousin was born there, I was born here. My cousin was treated as a normal American. I was born here, but treated as a foreigner. I can bring children to the world, the 5th or 6th or 7th generation, if you look at them a bit, black hair, black skin, they are still foreigners. That doesn't have anything to do with it, I'm already happy with it. You are beautiful, you speak German, you are a fully integrated citizen. Exactly, with citizens. No matter what happens, we will always stay abroad in Germany. In other countries... Do you feel like an expatriate? Of course I am an expatriate here. I speak German perfectly. That has nothing to do with the sound. Yes, exactly. What do you think about the subject? See you. Thank you. Now I said something wrong. I'm really curious what they will be published on the internet. That's why I'm really curious. Where were you? What are you from? German? I was born here in Munich. Wonderful. But do you know what I would like to know? If what I have quoted you from the Quran. I have never seen this place. But now you are following it and it is just in there. I don't know which book they read. Probably the one from the Tilo. Tilos Quran. I imagine that. Of course. Read it. I read it. I don't need it. I don't need it. Yes, but it's important for the future. We wish us a peaceful future. It's all we want. Just leave them all out. No, the foreigners should stay in, but the Muslims should leave. Thank you."

But, I mean, you know, as a joke. But the thing is, I found the guy doesn't have a sense of humor. And as a result, he really is mad.

And how much do you weigh? 327? 327 pounds. That's a lot more than you weigh, Lawler. Okay? Watch this. You wrestling a woman there. No, but she's bigger than him. And I figure if I could beat her, then I could, you know, I've wrestled women a lot bigger than Jerry Lawler. And what I think what I could do is I could like run, you know, I'm probably faster. I've been swimming, jumping rope. I'm probably have more endurance than him. I don't have muscles, I'm not as strong as him, but I can run him. tired and then I can, you know, maybe just after he gets tired, you know, I like I do to a big woman like that. That's right.

At first, when he challenged me, I thought it was a joke, and I said, no, and I don't wrestle men. But oh, I'll accept the challenge, you know? And so I ended up sending him all these videotapes threatening him, imitating the way he talks in Memphis and, you know, making, you know, I'm gonna beat you, you know, that kind of stuff and trying to make him mad. But, I mean, you know, as a joke. But the thing is, I found the guy doesn't have a sense of humor. And as a result, he really is mad. So we exchanged videotapes and what I'd like to show you is the videotape that I, that he has just recently made. And then right after that, the latest videotape that ring, I'm going to consider you a professional wrestler and I'm going to burst your bubble about being a wrestler and it'll be the last time you ever want to wrestle, it'll be the last time you ever want to step in the ring and it'll be the last time that you fantasize about being a wrestler. Andy Kaufman, you're going to get hurt son. You challenge me to a wrestling match and think you bit off a little more than you can chew. I'm going to wipe the floor with you Mr. Lawler. I'm going to give you a little sample. This is what's going to happen when you and I wrestle each other in Memphis. Come here. How tall are you Susan? And how much do you weigh? 327? 327 pounds. That's a lot more than you weigh, Lawler. Okay? Watch this. You wrestling a woman there. No, but she's bigger than him. And I figure if I could beat her, then I could, you know, I've wrestled women a lot bigger than Jerry Lawler. And what I think what I could do is I could like run, you know, I'm probably faster. I've been swimming, jumping rope. I'm probably have more endurance than him. I don't have muscles, I'm not as strong as him, but I can run him. tired and then I can, you know, maybe just after he gets tired, you know, I like I do to a big woman like that. That's right. And otherwise I, you know, I don't know. Well, I'm sorry you kids had to see this. Good luck Monday night. Thank you. Thank you very much, Andy Kaufman. And Slim Whitman will be right back here after you. Take care, and I'll catch you."

We are going to introduce you to our friends who are coming to invite us. You are very attentive. You are with us and we are not going to show you the importance, we are going to introduce you to everyone who we love, first of all those who visit us from outside. Florencia Chitodías, welcome. Thank you for being here. Thank you very much, Manuel, I like to greet you. Good morning to all the people who see us here on TV and in the bathroom. Thank you very much for your opportunity. I know there are many opportunities to get involved, but something that is very motivating for us is to come and help, not only the party, not only Lolita and Hugo, to help the citizens, the people who are watching us, to help them to have a different government, to know a different way of keeping them.

We have to push that change. We come to help them to get rid of that almost-and-a-hand. And in that we will work for them. The Priests, and now I say directly to our most important competition, none of the Priests now speaks with pride of their former presidents of the Republic. None of the Priests, the Priests candidate, can presume neither Cedillo, nor Salinas, nor Miguel de la Madrid, Not even José López Portillo, nor Echeberri, look closely, the last five presidents of the republic of that party who want to return, it has been a disaster for Mexico, no one puts it as, the only one who puts it as an example is the one who killed them."

No representa un movimiento, no representa Luis Manuel y el movimiento ciudadano, pues creo que no será una opción. Aquí la disputa real está entre el partido revolucional, institucional y el partido del trabajo. Esa es la verdadera disputa. el primer consejero universitario, dio una lucha contra el plan de privatización de la UNAM, fue uno de los fundadores del periódico reforma y periodista del mismo, y preocupado por los que menos tienen, presentó una iniciativa para que los programas sociales se otorguen por ley y no como de la diva del gobierno del estado. Ha escrito libros sobre política y temas relacionados con los jóvenes. Nuestro futuro está aquí. Y si lo podemos alcanzar, estamos en el camino correcto.","Miguel Ángel Juárez Franco, candidate of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, for president of Nesahualco y OT. Miguel Ángel, give me your opinion regarding the movement of the citizens. Well, the movement of the citizens is integrated as a party. At the national level, you have to make them recognize because they are supporting the candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But at the local level, it seems to me that They are being narrowed because the candidate of Luis Alberto seems to me to be more an attempt to position himself as a capricho because they didn't give him the other side, he goes to the citizen movement and then it is not a candidate that represents a capricho better. It does not represent a movement, it does not represent Manuel. and the movement Ciudadano will not be an option. The real dispute is between the institutional and the work party. That's the real dispute. The first university counselor gave a fight against the privatization plan of UNAM. Thanks to that, 24 generations of young people in the state have been able to study their university. It was one of the founders of the periodic reform and the periodist of the same. Being a citizen, the Secretary of Public Security of the State of Mexico did not promote it, which has recently been approved. And worried about those who have less, she presented an initiative so that social programs are granted by law and not as a gift. We are on the right path."

With this proposal, in 2004, in the north of Rio Grande do Sul, the multirão was founded by digital inclusion. Digital inclusion is not just access. People can be appropriated by technology so that they can recognize this technology as a space for the US Army and communication. According to the digital exclusion map, carried out by IBGE, in Brazil only 8% of the population have access to the internet. In 5 years, the MUTIRÕ has attended more than 700 people. The activities are carried out in computer laboratories like this one, inside the University of Passo Fundo. But since the beginning of this year, the project is also in a new space. In this school, the essential teaching is in the city's periphery. It is an exception inside the project's dynamics. We are going to work inside the laboratory there so that people can actually start using it, feel the laboratory as an integral space of the school, and they can make a difference in the life of the person who is a health worker. The hands are fast, the clicks, and the eyes are seen on the computer's screen. The mutation in the digital cousin changed the routine at school. They recognize these computers as a space limited to development. Before the offices, Douglas had difficulties with the engine coordination. What did you learn here with the computer? Many things. Read, write, design, Painting... They are feeling more safe and are collaborating a lot for their alphabetization. Karine is an example of this. Learning to read and write. Before, I didn't know how to read and write. No. They are the first spaces of those who are learning that technology is a space without borders. Where they can feel participants capable of creating, capable of exploring and discovering, not just a machine, but a medium, I'm not a human being."

Самое главное, знает стратегию, тактику и сильные, слабые стороны своего противника. Самое главное, что думает, что сможет противостоять Олбрайта, поскольку в запасе где-то там в загашнике есть новый приемчик, и ему думается, что он справится в борьбе против Гарри Олбрайта, который, кстати говоря, также представляет Соединенные Штаты. Бодры самоуверенно, смотрите, Козловский выбегает на ринг. Уже давние знакомые, и сетителей Будокана. Ну а вот и Гарри Олбрайт. Соединенные из Штаты Америки. И Олбрайт говорит, что борьба с Козловским может оказаться чрезвычайно набреженной. Достижения Козловских, конечно, впечатляют, но в данном случае эти достижения Козловских может спрятаться себе в карман. Обрать также убежден, что ему удастся провести полный Нельсон и бросить своего соперника головой Апол, что будет гарантировать ему победу. Посмотрим, как оно будет поймем в ближайшие минуты. Оба соперника, несомненно, очень хорошо знают друг друга. Оба представляют США и, конечно, встречались не раз на ринге и на борцовском ковре. Денис Козловский, который, кстати говоря, является одним из ведущих специалистов по грекаримской борьбе последнего десятилетия. Ни раз получил медали на мировых чемпионатах и на олимпийских играх. Ему 33 года и достаточно опытный боец. Хотя в профессиональном рестлинге управил всего на всего два боя и, кстати говоря, опа проиграл. Вот такой вот Денис Козловский. Сейчас мы узнаем, кто же такой Гарри Олбрайт и, самое главное, Откуда он родом? Понятно, что из США. Но вот сейчас мы видим, что он из Монтаны. Человек со шрамом такой. Ему 30 лет этот боец 350 фунтов, согласитесь после Японца, который весит 200. Это нечто. 13 боев, 12 побед. Вот так вот, друзья мои. Рыдьеве вот так, запрещенный брейел. Совершенно. Который фактически применяется в уличных драгах, но не на ринге. что здесь кодекс чести самурая должен главенствовать за это козловский сразу же проводит болевой прием албрайту и надо сразу же показывать ему кузьки ну мать поскольку козловский фамилия обязывает но албрайта обязывает его вес тянуться канатом козловский не было думая оттаскивает албрайта к центру и опять все повторяется но все-таки 350 фунтов вы помните друзья мои 350 фунтов весит албрайт и я не знаю и Олбрайд, а несмотря на то, что тот гораздо тяжелее его, как в чисто спортивной борьбе. Вот посмотрите на выражение лица Олбрайд и ему эти захваты, что шли, как говорится, что ехали. Но никакого эффекта они не производят. Здесь надо Козловский придумать что-то оригинальное. И вот захват делает Денис Козловский. Олбрайд достаточно спокойно держит руку своего соперника, но выражение лица у того не очень-то рада. не очень хорошо ладеет ударами и борьбой ногами. Попадает, судя по всему, Козловский на болевой не очень выгодная для того, чтобы лезть из рейт позиция. Действительно очень неприятно сейчас. Неприятное положение в обвал Козловский. Он пытается захватить ладышку. Гарри Олбрэйта и Олбрэйт реагируют на это, как женщина реагирует на импульс. Вот, пожалуйста, молодец Козловский. Нащупал слабый, а он не очень хорошо ладит ударами. Молодец! Чувствительный для соперника, поскольку жесткое покрытие ринга, оно достаточно болезненно для почек и хрипта спортсмена, который падает после такого броска. Козловский, мы видим, идёт на удушающий, но Allbrite очень правильно применяет защитную тактику и, скорее всего, без особых помех может выпутаться. Действительно так оно и произошло, но, тем не менее, дотронулся Allbrite до канатов без особых для себя. Позвольте, пожалуйста, подпишите на канал, чтобы не пропустить новые видео. Бедные лопатки, но самое главное, бедная шея Дениса Козловская. Ну а это победитель Гарри Олбрайт. 350 фунтов, друзья мои. И все-таки те планы, которые Гарри Олбрайт строил на этот бой, полный Нельсон и бросок соперников в пол, они реализовались на все 100%. Молодец, что сказать. Олбрайт, человек, слова которого не расходятся. Сделан. Мы это видели только что. Великолепно. Казловскому остается только по сочувству.","It's much better to fight against those who know the strategy, tactics and weak sides of your opponent. The most important thing is that you think you can fight against the Obright because he has a new opponent in the reserve and he thinks he can fight against the Obright, which is also a joint staff. The water is very confident. Look, Kazlovsky runs to the ring. The old acquaintances of the Budokan fans. Here it is. And Gary Albright. United States of America. And Albright says that the fight with Kazlovsky can seem extremely tense. Kazlovsky's achievements, of course, impress, but in this case, all these achievements of Kazlovsky can hide themselves in their pockets. He will also choose to make sure that he can complete Nelson and drop his opponent's head, and the floor, which will guarantee him victory. Let's see how it will be in the coming minutes. The opponent's shoes are undoubtedly very well known to each other. The shoes represent the USA and of course met several times in the ring and in the wrestling carpet. Denis Kazlovsky, who is one of the leading specialists in the Greek-Roman wrestling industry in the last decade, has received medals at the world championships and at the Olympic Games. He is 33 years old and an experienced fighter. Although he has been in professional wrestling for only two years, and by the way, he has played both. Here is Denis Kazlovsky, and now we will find out who Garry Obright is. It's clear that he is from the US. But now we see that he is from Montana, a man with a scar. He is 30 years old. This fighter has 350 pounds. Agree after Japan, which weighs 200. It's something. 13 fights, 12 wins. That's how it is, friends. Rittery is a forbidden move. It is actually used in street fights, but not in ring fights. It's not clear that Samurai should be the head of this team. Kazlovsky immediately makes a foul. He has to show his face to Kuzkin. Kazlovsky's surname is obligated to him. But Albright is obligated to his weight. He is pulling to the ropes. Kazlovsky didn't have it. He takes Albright to the center. And again, everyone repeats. But 350 pounds. Remember, guys, 350 pounds. Albright is hanging. He has a lot of strength and can use his engine to push this bar from the spot. Allbright throws Kazlovsky in a great way. He is still 14-14 but he has a lot of advantage from Montana. He has a great throw through himself and will push Kazlovsky. Kazlovsky is a quick fighter but he has a sport style and gets another hit. Allbright's pressure on his opponent's head is not deprived of any kind of subtext and his own words. He is, apparently, a knockdown. Look at the replay. Babak! There really can be a decisive call break. But Kozlovsky is great! Simply great! He remembered his sport Olympic past when he fought in love. Allbright threw it, despite the fact that it is much heavier than it, as in purely sports wrestling. Look at the expression of the Allbright's face, and his grip, as they say, that they drove, but they do not produce any effect. Here, Kozlovsky has to come up with something original, and here, the grip makes Denis Kozlovsky. Allbright is quite calm, holds his opponent's hand, but the expression of the face is not very pleasant. Allbright is very calm and turns away from this unpleasant situation. Kazlovsky himself goes to Nelson while it's a single-hand Nelson. But nevertheless, it's very unpleasant for Garry Allbright. Allbright, well done! While Kazlovsky got caught by Allbright's one hand, the other hand was stolen by Denis Kazlovsky's leg. Both of them are in a horizontal position now. I don't understand why Americans don't like to hit and fight with their legs. It seems that Kazlovsky is not very comfortable to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be And here are the canadas. Only they saved them. Garry Olbreit, 13-10. Well done, two great minutes. Dennis Kozlovsky made it. And he gave up his advantage. 13-10. Let's see what happens next. So far, we can't see anything in Garry Olbreit's life. He's a warrior, a nymph and a head. One more throw. Well done! Well done, despite the fact that he's a sports fighter, It is a very sensitive opponent, because the ring is quite painful for the elbow and the athlete's grip. Kazlovsky, as we can see, goes for the soul, but Albright uses the defensive tactics very well and, most likely, without special obstacles can get out of the fight. It really happened, but, nevertheless, Albright was touched by the ropes without special skills. Another time the fighters are coming from the middle of the ring. And well done, Kozlovsky. But it's not easy to tear the Allbrite off the ring. We see it, especially there. Oh! What a counterattack was carried out. And 12-9. 12-9, that's the score. If a couple of such moves will come in the near future, it's very difficult. Kazlovsky will stay in the top position. Here is the great fight. Just great. The referee is entering the business. And, apparently, Kazlovsky is very weak now. Very weak. Obviously, the doctors should have been more careful. And that's it. Victory. Victory with a knockout. Clear victory. Garry Olbrov is this blow. Look. Poor shoulder, but the most important thing is the poor neck of Denis Kozlovsky. And this winner of the Allbrite gallery is 350 pounds, my friends. And all the same, those plans that Igor Allbrite built for this fight, full of nation and a drop of opponents in the floor, they realized for all 100 percent. Well done, what can I say, Allbrite, a person whose words are not used We saw it only. Great!"

Oh, no problem My friend Jackie said that I need to talk to a lawyer so I took some notes and I just would like to talk to you a little bit How long have you been married? 15 years to my husband Frank. You got children? We do. We have two children Amy who's 11 and Bobby's 9 How has the marriage generally been going so far? Over the years it's been good. We've had our ups and downs like any married couple does but I never thought that our disagreements were anything serious where did you meet in college then you got married got married and after that I went to nursing school got my degree Frank went to work for ABC Corporation are you still working as a nurse no I did work for about three years when after when we had Amy and then when Bobby was born we decided to best we to stay home and been home for nine years who handles the finances Frank does We do. This is where I took the notes. We do have investments through a broker and he's mentioned I think in the past that he does some trading online just himself. Do you know anything about that trading when he does there? I don't. Where do you live? We own our own house. Very nice house. Nice neighborhood. The kids are happy. They have friends. Approximately what is it worth and do you have a mortgage? We do have a mortgage. I would say the house is worth about 300,000 and the mortgage is about half of that, so 150. Do you own any other real estate other than the house? We do. We have a camp up on Lake George. Do you know what that's worth? I don't. Frank mentioned how the investments are doing. He's mentioned a couple times in the economy that they've gone down, but I mean I would think that's normal. Okay, but he hasn't told you how badly they're doing? No, and honestly I haven't asked him. Does he have any retirement accounts? He does. He has a 401k. You know what is in it? No. What brought you here exactly? Well, honestly I think it was about six months ago and Frank started acting a little strange, not like himself anymore. Got angry more often, he never was really an angry person and he started to refuse to talk to me sometimes. He was spending a lot of time away from home, not telling me where he was going. One night he left the computer on and I saw some emails that he had been sending to a woman and um... Did you confront him about this? I did. What happened? He got angry at me, called me an idiot, which that was not in his vocabulary before, and he actually moved out of our bedroom. Is he still out of the bedroom? He is. How long has that been? I'd say five and a half months. Just to be honest with you, I can't stand this anymore. I really can't. I'm not happy. How has Frank's attitude been since you confronted him and he moved out? He started drinking a lot unlike before and I think that's made him kind of volatile. He gets angry with the kids some, which he never did. He always had patience for the kids. But that's all changed now? No, they're actually afraid of him. Really? I've talked to their teachers. and both of their teachers say that their grades have been going down. Have you discussed divorce with him? I did and he was not happy. Said that if I file for divorce that he will take everything and I'll have nothing. Kids and I are going to live in some nasty apartment which I don't think is okay for the kids' sake. And if I do have to move, it's very important to me that the kids get to stay in the same school.

That's the issue here. My next guest says prosecutors are using techniques normally used in criminal cases to make sure this case is airtight. Stuart Meisner is a former assistant attorney general for the state of New York currently managing member of Stuart D Meisner LLC. Stuart, five of the people charged today have already pleaded guilty. Do you think that they're cutting deals? How important is that to the overall case for the prosecution? Well, thank you, Liz. I definitely do believe that that they are looking to cut deals with the prosecutor. It certainly is very helpful to have cooperative witnesses to testify in federal prosecutions. And obviously it would only add to the evidence that they obtained from wiretaps, which is frankly unique. It's typically used in organized crime investigations and prosecutions. So it is a shot across the bow of Wall Street that they will use techniques that have previously been used other organized crime investigations for Wall Street investigations. So I think it is very interesting. Well, we all remember Bud Fox in the movie Wall Street wearing the wire, but we do not usually see wire taps for Wall Street or high finance cases. So I guess my question is this, what advantage does that give prosecutors to have that? And are they under pressure to bring in more arrests so that they bolster their case? Well, it is an enormous advantage. This case sounds like it was a huge web of insider trading if the allegations are true. It's not just someone who just like the Martha Stewart case, one person trading on the insider trading, but it seemed like it was an organized effort to use inside information by multiple individuals to help a hedge fund for a very long time. And it's very unique and I'm not surprised that the prosecutors would use such resources such as wiretaps, which you would need to go to a judge to get authorization. for and pursue it in that fashion. Stuart, you've been on the inside of the New York Attorney General's office. Do you get the sense that they can win this case? Based on what I've heard, I think it's a very strong case so far. Stuart, stay with us. I want to bring in the team. The SEC director said today that some of the accused seem to think somehow that they were in a James Bond movie. Listen in. There are certain moral truths that are self-evident, and there's should be a moment, hopefully before you're holding a bag of cash, delivered to you by somebody codenamed the Octopussy that causes anyone in a position to tip or trade inside information to think twice before taking such a misguided step. And if you find yourself chewing the memory card in your cell phone to destroy any record of a conversation, something has gone terribly wrong with your character. Chewing the memory card. Okay, these details are getting crazier by the minute. I think they're above the law and Chris Carter, that's a rhetorical question. I know either that or they're very hungry. And I tell you, Steven Segal said it best. No one is above the law. It's amazing though, after what they've seen from these last this last year with really cracked down on this white collar crime and how anybody can think they can get away with it or that the fact that they're working on Wall Street would give them an edge or they've got a lot of money would give them an edge. It's pretty crazy to me. Robert Gray, there is always that arrogance. very wealthy people sometimes feel that they are above the laws. Is this a manifestation of that? Absolutely. And you've got any of they mentioned this web and you've got people on, you know, they've got lawyers involved. You've got traders, various hedge funds, analysts involved here. And they were getting this information tipped off Liz. You remember in 2007, every time a stock would jump, there was no news on it. They were instantly an M&A takeover target. Well, these guys were getting ahead of those runs and they thought, you know, we've got this great little web of different people in strategic places will never get called. But that's, you know, they're following. that's when they trip up, they end up do getting caught. And Stuart, can lawyers, can prosecutors use that as behavior that is pretty damning evidence? saying a guilty conscience needs no accuser. I use that often when I was a prosecutor in summation.

Today, in this video, I'd like to touch on a topic that isn't always very often associated with ADD, but just recently researchers and psychologists and psychiatrists have been focusing on this as a factor in your child's ADD. And what we want to talk about today is temperament. Temperament is something that shows up almost at birth. If there's some characteristic that you recognize in your child, almost in the infant stage, then that's more likely temperament. It's a genetic trait. For example, one of my sons came out of the womb in motion and he stayed in motion. He's in his 20s now. He's still in motion. But as a child, the girls at church would like to, wanted to hold him. these beautiful blue eyes and white hair as cute as can be, but they can only hold them for about 10 or 15 minutes and then they would just be worn out because he would just roll in your arms like a rotisserie chicken. And another of my children came out in charge, had five years old. She was the fifth child, but she was in charge of everybody in the house. And that's something I just saw in her birth. Now, why are we talking about temperament. Temperament has a lot to do with learning and development. How aggressive, how curious, how shy, how extroverted a child is can affect their learning and development. It also will affect the likelihood, severity, and the duration of ADD. And so when you go to get your child diagnosed, make sure that the psychologist or psychiatrist takes that factor into consideration. Temperament. I just wanted to finish this off just with a few examples of temperament and these are kind of opposites. Active versus calm. My son was active. I have another daughter that's very calm, very serene and sociable versus shy. Playful versus serious. The list goes on and on. Again, my book, Putting in Parenting, there's a fairly extensive list and you can look at that and kind of see where your child comes in there and and have that be a basis for discussion with their caregiver. Again, my name is Sterling Pratt. For more information on this, you can go to my website, addparentingsupport.com, or you can email me any questions or comments directly at Sterling at addparentingsupport.com.

For example, one of my sons came out of the womb in motion and he stayed in motion. He's in his 20s now, he's still in motion. But as a child, the girls of church would like to, wanted to hold him. these beautiful blue eyes and white hair as cute as can be but they can only hold them for about 10 or 15 minutes and then they would just be worn out because he would just roll in your arms like a rotisserie chicken and another of my children came out in charge. I had five years old. She was the fifth child but she was in charge of everybody in the house and that's something I just saw in her birth. Now why are we talking about temperament. Temperament has a lot to do with learning and development. How aggressive, how curious, how shy, how extroverted a child is can affect their learning development. It also will affect the likelihood, severity, and the duration of ADD. And so when you go to get your child diagnosed, make sure that the psychologist or psychiatrist takes that factor into consideration, temperament. I just wanted to finish this off just with a few examples of temperament. And these are kind of opposites. Active versus calm. My son was active. I have another daughter that's very calm, very serene. And sociable versus shy. Playful versus serious. The list goes on and on. Again, my book, Putting in Parenting, there's a fairly extensive list. And you can look at that and kind of see where your child comes in there. and have that be a basis for discussion with their caregiver. Again, my name is Sterling Pratt. For more information on this, you can go to my website, addparentingsupport.com, or you can email me any questions or comments directly at Sterling at addparentingsupport.com. Thanks."

El cardiólogo Michael Sabon también estudiaba las experiencias de casi muerte cuando se topó con un relato extraordinario. Pam Reynolds era una cantante y compositora bien establecida y una madre atariada. En 1991 enfermó seriamente. la caída de la voz, la dificultad de mover el cuerpo. Y fue a ese punto que mi physician recomendó que tengo una cadena de cacos. Y la cadena de cacos, por supuesto, ha mostrado el aneurismo. Y fue un gran, un gran aneurismo. Yo lo referí al neorólogo y el neorólogo me dio la oportunidad de vivir en todo. a pesar de los pronósticos, el neurocirujano Robert Spetzler decidió tomar el caso de pan. en este modelo de plástico de la cabeza. Y nos ponemos en la parte que nos da el topo del corazón. Lo que estamos hablando de es que ese anurismo está todo en el mismo punto del corazón. Y eso es por eso que es muy difícil de llegar ahí. Así que hay que ir de alguna manera a la escala, porque recuerda, la cabeza y el dedo están aquí para llegar a este lugar muy difícil. la operación inmovil. La temperatura de Pam descendió hasta los 15 ó 10 grados centígrados, detuvieron su corazón, su respiración y sus ondas cerebrales y drenaron la sangre de su cabeza. Estaría clínicamente muerta durante la hora de operación. el ámbito de la cabeza se despliega completamente, para que no haya una actividad neuronal. Prueba que la operación empezara, mucha actividad se va a llevar. El paciente se va a dormir, los ojos son tapados. Hay unos dispositivos clínicos que se van a poner en cada ojo para monitorar el corazón. El paciente se va a poner completamente cubierto. La única cosa que se ha expuesto es que el cuerpo se va a poner en una parte de la cabeza. es la área de la cabeza donde trabajamos. No me recuerdo de un ruido operativo. No me recuerdo de ver a Dr. Spetzler en todo. Yo era con un amigo. Uno de sus amigos. Estaba conmigo a ese momento. Después de eso, nada. Absolutamente nada. Hasta el sonido. Y el sonido era... inclinado. Era un río. Era un río que no era una oficina de una oficina. Y me quedé en el suelo. Padres, ¿qué tal? Yo me recuerdo preguntar, ¿qué están haciendo? Porque esto es una sur de su mente. Y lo que sucedió fue que se acceden a las artes femorales para que se despliegue. Y no entendí eso. En el proceso de mi estudio, fui a entrevistar a Dr. Speztler y miré su reportaje operativo. Y encontré que lo que ella veía de su experiencia de cuerpo, parecía corresponder muy acuérdico a lo que ha ocurrido. She looked at the bone saw that was being used to cut open her skull. I didn't have any idea what this thing looked like. She described it as an electric toothbrush, which I thought was ridiculous. I had to send off for a picture of this saw to Fort Worth, Texas to confirm whether or not what she said it looked like actually was accurate. And I was astounded when I saw the picture. It indeed does resemble an electric toothbrush. No creo que las observaciones que hizo ella se basaron en lo que se ha hecho en la que se ha hecho en el teatro de la operación. Ellos estaban solo no disponibles a ella. Por ejemplo, el truco y así así. Estas cosas son todos cubiertas. No son visibles. Están dentro de sus packages. No comenzas a abrir hasta que el paciente se entienda completamente para que se mantenga el ambiente steril. en la operación, entre Dr. Spessler y las sergientes cardiovasculares que estaban cortando sus manos para despegar a la máquina de la lunga de la cabeza. Cuando la surgeon Cardiac se incidió a su right groin, ella se encontró en sus vainas y las arderías eran tan pequeñas y ella tenía que ir hacia el lado izquierdo. Y había una conversación en el momento en que entre los doctores Pam acuérdense de escuchar esa conversación. En esa fase en la operación, nadie puede y observar aquí en ese estado. Y lo encontré inconcebible que tu sensación normal, como la escuchación, que ella había clicado en los modulos en cada año, que no había manera para ella escuchar esos viajes de la audiencia normal. Entonces, de nuevo, esto es muy sugerente de la verdad que hay alguna especie de percepción extracensiva o experiencia de cuerpo o cualquier cosa que estaba permitiendo a Pam escuchar acuáticamente y ver acuátamente lo que estaba pasando en la sala operadora. Si no hubiera tenido una experiencia de muerte, no habría interés en estar aquí hoy. Creo que la muerte es una ilusión. Creo que la muerte es una lucha muy rara. No veo ninguna verdad en la muerte de todo.","In Atlanta, Georgia, a case was going to surprise both experts and doctors. Cardiologist Michael Sabon also studied the experiences of death when he was faced with an extraordinary story. Pam Reynolds was a well established singer and a well-trained mother. In 1991, she seriously ill. Para Pam had a last hope. 3,200 km to the Neurological Institute of Phoenix, Arizona. Despite the forecasts, Neuro-Siljano Robert Spetzler decided to take the case of Pam. The surgery that I was going to undergo is known as the mobile operation. The Pam temperature went down to 15 or 10 degrees Celsius, stopped his heart, his breathing and his brain waves and drained the blood from his head. He would be clinically dead during the operation hour. The patient is put to sleep, the eyes are taped shut. There are little clicking devices put in each ear in order to monitor the brain. The patient is then completely covered. The only thing that's really exposed is the patient's eyes. I don't remember an operating room. I don't remember seeing Dr. Spetzler at all. I was with a fellow, one of his fellows, was with me at that time. After that, nothing, absolutely nothing, until the sound. And the sound was unpleasant, it was guttural. It was reminiscent of being in a dentist's office. and I remember the top of my head tingling, and I just sort of popped out of the top of my head. And I was then looking down at the body. I knew it was my body, but I didn't care. My vantage point was sort of sitting on the doctor's shoulder. I remember the instrument in his hand. It looked like they handled my electric toothbrush. I had assumed that they were going to open I had heard the term saw, but what I saw looked a lot more like a drill than a saw. It even had little bits that were kept in this case that looked like the case that my father stored his socket wrenches in when I was a child. And I remember distinctly hearing a female voice saying, Padres, just try the other side. It seemed to come from further down on the table. I do remember wondering, what are they doing? Because this is brain surgery. And what had happened was they accessed ephemeral arteries in order to drain the blood. And I did not understand that. In the process of my study, I went and interviewed Dr. Speztler and looked at his operative report. And I found that what she saw from her out of body experience seemingly corresponded very accurately to what had actually occurred. She looked at the bone saw that was being used to cut open her skull. I didn't have any idea what this thing looked like. She described it as an electric toothbrush, which I thought was ridiculous. I had to send off for a picture of this saw to Fort Worth, Texas, to confirm whether or not what she said it looked like actually was accurate. And I was astounded when I saw the picture. It indeed does resemble an electric toothbrush. I don't think that the observations she made were based on what she experienced as she went into the operating room theater. They were just not available to her. For example, the drill and so on, those things are all covered up. They're not visible. They were inside their packages. You really don't begin to open until the patient is completely asleep so that you maintain a sterile environment. She also heard a conversation during At that stage in the operation, nobody can see her. and observe here in that state. And I find it inconceivable that your normal senses, such as hearing, let alone the fact that she had clicking modules in each year, that there was any way for her to hear those through normal auditory pathways. So again, this is very suggestive of the fact that there was some sort of extrasensory perception or out-of-body experience or whatever I think death is an illusion. I think death is a really nasty bad lie. I don't see any truth in the word death at all."

Euer Gast vom alten Kirchplatz, nachdem ich mich jetzt bei dem Anruf von dem Barak da erholt habe. Aber jetzt wieder ein bisschen Zeit, so zu relaxen, mit der Darmstuhl, so ein bisschen rumzuhängen, immer so anzugucken, was so die Medienlandschaft und so die Welt im Allgemeinen da zum Besten gibt. Und da ist uns der Einfluss des Monats erst mal aufgefallen, wie der Mond so Einfluss auf Ereignisse hat, zum Beispiel so auf den Abstieg von Eintracht Frankfurt. Das hat es sich nicht nähen lassen für die Eintracht-Fans. Dieses kleine Lied zu singen, selbst der sauberer Christoph konnte nicht helfen, aber ich denke auch selbst Nostradamus hätte da nicht helfen können. Deshalb dies lied als kleiner Post. Hier kommt wieder. Aber Nostradamus und ich wollen eben noch mal draußen und wir denken, dass so diese Ereignisse, als wir heute Das ist der erste Mal, dass die Musiker sich mit dem Mond einfließen.

Das ist der erste Mal, dass die Musiker sich mit dem Mond einfließen. Das ist der erste Mal, dass die Musiker sich mit dem Mond einfließen. Das ist der erste Mal, dass die Musiker sich mit dem Mond einfließen. Das ist der erste Mal, dass die Magath hat sich schon die Straßenkarte angeguckt nach Ingolstadt. Und jetzt darf er doch noch bleiben. Glück gehabt! Jetzt lässt er sich natürlich feiern als Zauberer. Genauso Zauberer wie der Christoph. Aber das ist ja auch alles nicht so interessant. Danke Elvis, das war jetzt wirklich nett von dir. Was da in der Freude, in Osteream, mich viel mehr erschreckt hat. Also diese Karnevalsveranstaltung da. Immer diese kleinen gelben Zwerge. Ich kann sie nicht mehr sehen. Was hatten die sich lieb? Und der kleine Zwerg mit dem kleinen Schnäuzer, der hat ja auf die Pauke gehauen. Also er lässt sich jetzt nicht mehr alles von Mutti gefallen. Wenn ihr das zu ohren kommt, der stand auch unter irgendwelchen Einflissen. Vielleicht meckt man daran auf schon, dass mit dem Magnetfeld die Erde irgendwas nicht mehr in Ordnung sein muss, weil da verließt jede Leute so die Erdhaftung verloren haben. Die sind irgendwie nicht mehr geerdet. Leena ist weg, Asa bei Jan hat gewonnen. Magat fühlt sich als Sieger, obwohl er eigentlich knosgut hätte Lotto spielen können. Daumen ist weg. Der kleine Philipp schwebt dann irgendwelchen Szenrum. Und der Hammer ist ja, dass dieser Steinbrück, dieser Sympathieträger, da auf dem Norden Germaniens, jetzt so gesagt hat, er könnte sich gut vorstellen, er könnte auch so ganz klar werden. Da hatte er von der Nalista sofort einen auf Mut gekriegt. Ich weiß auch gar nicht, wo der Steinbrück die Zeit hernehmen will, bei den ganzen Vorträgen, der der in England hält. Der war ja so die Korrifee, so hier als Minister. Da hat er ja Deutschland so richtig aus der Finanzkrise so rausgekommen. Ja, jetzt meinte er aber so eher wie so ein kleiner Barack hier in Deutschland. Aber irgendwie dazu ist es ein bisschen zu arrogant. Nostalsams arrogant ist die richtige Formulierung. Ja, wir kennen ihn ja nicht persönlich. Wir kennen ihn ja auch nur so von den Interviews. Und ich weiß nicht, was Elvis dazu sagen will. Ich habe auch das. Kaspar, die klettern immer noch mit Treffer hier. Es ist nicht zu glauben. Aber das scheinen so die Sonnenstürme im Universum schon Ausliebungen herzuhaben. Denn es heißt ja, wenn so Sonnenstürme kommen, dann bevor die dann richtig tatsächlich eintreten, dann verändert sich die Psyche der Menschen. Dann werden die ganz komisch. Der gute, komische Wart ist stärtlich. Das ist besorgniserregend. Wie beobachten das auf alle Fälle mal? Bevor das hier so eskaliert, werden wir uns noch mal melden. Auf jeden Fall, das ist alles ein bisschen komisch. Ich weiß nicht, ob die dann morgen demnächst auch alle hier auf einmal auf der linken Seite fahren. Weiß ich nicht. Oder ob die da die Idee mag wieder haben wollen. Also, irgendwas kommt da auf euch zu, liebe Sterbliche. Nosteramus und ich, wir gucken doch mal, der will es ja ohnehin wieder seine alten Bücher und hat die wildesten Voraussagen. Aber nee. Wenn ich das mir noch mal vor Augen führ, Leena, geschlagen von Azar-Bajan, Frankfurt in der zweiten Liga, Magat hat Glück, Daum hat Pech, Rösler, ich also. Und dann das Steinbrück, hat man schon fast vergessen. Ich hatte erst gedacht, die meilen Steinmeier, weil der genauso sympathisch ist, hat eine andere Frisur, Schlach? Ich weiß nicht. Demnächst kommt Mündter auch noch wieder an und Hellmut und Schäuble kommt angerollt. Ach nee, ich will mir das gar nicht ausmacht. Ich sag mal wieder, bis die Tage. Machts gut, ne? Schönen Sonntag.","Hello, I am your guest again from the old church square. After I have received the call from the bar, I have some time to relax, to hang around a bit with our ladies, to look at what the media landscape and the world in general is. the moon has a influence on events such as the departure of a Frank Frank. Even the clean Christos couldn't help. Even Nostradamus couldn't help. That's why this song is a little post. many with the moon, the only thing that has to do with the moon. This song could also be for Lena. Yes, Lena beat by Azerbaijan. What's going on? There you can see what the universe can do with humans. Today was really cool. Magat has already looked at the streets, looked at Ingolstadt and now he can still stay. Congratulations! Now you can of course be a magician like Christoph. But that's not so interesting. Thank you Elvis. What was there in the room today? I was much more scared. So this carnival event was there. Always these little yellow pigs. I can't see them anymore. What did they love each other? What did they love each other? And the little pig with the little snout, he was on the pig's back. So he doesn't let himself be all of mud anymore. If you come to the court, it was also influenced by some. Maybe you could also make it so that something would not have to be in order with the magnet field. Because there are many people who have lost their heritage. They are no longer inherited. Look, Lena is gone. Asa by John won. Magat feels like a winner, although he could have played the game better. Daum is gone. The little Philip, he then sweeps around the seams. And the great thing is that this stone bridge, this sympathy carrier from the northern Germanians, He could imagine himself well, he could be so cancerous. He got a new one from the Nalista. I don't even know where the Steinbrück wants to take the time. It was the whole lecture that he was in England. He was the Corrifé, as a minister. He was really out of the financial crisis in Germany. But now he said, he wants a little barrack here in Germany. But somehow it's a bit too arrogant. The word Nostradamus arrogant is the correct form. We don't know him personally. We only know him from the interviews. And I don't know what Elvis would say about it. I wonder what's going on here. But it seems that the sunrises in the universe are already very important. Because it means that if sunrises come before they actually enter, then the psyche of people changes. Then they will be very strange. I would like to say that I really want to say that. I don't know either. I don't know. Yes, Elvis. How do we observe this in all cases? Before this escalates here, we will report again. In any case, everything is a bit strange. I don't know if they want to go to the left side next to the clock. I don't know. Or if they want to have the idea market again. So, something is coming up to you, dear, starry, right? Nostradamus and I, we'll have a look. He's going to tell his old books without looking. And he has the wildest foretells. But no. I have almost forgotten the stone bridge. I don't know. The next one will be Mündterrauch again and Hellmut and Schäuble will be rolled up. Oh no, I don't want to do that. I'll say it again. Until the day. Take care. Have a nice Sunday."

Allora, con quale spirito affronti questa nuova sfida Fausto? che mi onoro adesso di rappresentare in qualità di direttore con profondi sensi di creatitudine nei confronti degli editori. Voi sapete l'affetto che mi legava al vostro editor, Raleo Pallante, a Quintino, perché noi che facciamo informazione dobbiamo sempre essere grati agli editori che ci consentono di fare questo mestiere. E il primo messaggio, il primo ringraziamende, io lo mando alla famiglia Ricci che mi ha voluto come direttore di primo piano. Ecco Fausto, tu hai anche un ruolo di consigliere nazionale e vicepresidente della Commissione Giuridica dell'Ordine. Allora come unirai questi incarichi con quello di direttore di primo piano Molise? Ma spero di poterlo fare e di continuare a farlo sempre nell'interesse dei colleghi della categoria con rinnovato senso e spirito di sacrificio perché si tratta di compiti gravosi che comunque penso di poter portare avanti in considerazione del fatto che posso disporre di una squadra di colleghi e collaboratori nel giornale veramente apprezzata anche dai lettori che seguono primo piano con Pasquale Damiani che è noto a tutti che è un vero e proprio trattore dell'informazione con Pino Saluppo che continua a fare il direttore di Teleregione e poi non posso ci dargli tutti perché c'ho una serie infinita di collaboratori sparsi nelle realizzazioni di termoli di Sernia, di Venafro, di Agnone e Veramente penso di poter contare sulla loro collaborazione e sulla loro professionalità. e cercare di essere non necessariamente contro il palazzo, ma seguire l'attività dei nostri politici, dei nostri amministatori, magari anche senza falsa modezza, con quella voglia di consigliare alla luce delle nostre varie esperienze professionali, quelle che possono essere le soluzioni per far sì che il Molise possa veramente fare l'atteso salto di qualità, sia dal punto di vista sociale ed economico, in un periodo veramente preoccupante, perché la che agente ha bisogno di essere ascoltate di una mano.","We are with Fausto Sigonolfi. From February 26, 1971, he wrote to the journalists' orders and today he signed your first editorial as the new director of the first Molyseus. So, what spirit do you face this new challenge Fausto? I would like to thank the editor of the newspaper, who is my honor to present to you in quality as a director with deep sense of gratitude in the confrontations of the editors. You know the affection that was linked to your editor, the speaker, Quintino, because we who make information must always be grateful to the editors who allow us to do this job. The first message, the first thank you, I send it to the Ricci family who wanted me to as the director of the first floor. You are also a role as a national advisor and vice president of the Judicial Commission of the Order. So how will you join these charges with the director of the first floor, Molise? I hope I can do it and continue to do it, it seems in the interest of colleagues of the category with renewed sense and spirit of sacrifice because it is about the gravestone companies that I think I can contribute I can say that I can talk about a team of colleagues and collaborators in the newspaper, really appreciated by the readers who follow the first floor, Pasquale Damiani who noticed everyone who is a true tractor of information, Pino Saluppo who continues to be the director of television, and then I can't give them all because there is an infinite series of collaborators scattered in the realities of Thermo, Sernia, Venafro, Agnone, I think I can count on their collaboration and their professionalism. and try to be not necessarily against the palace but to follow the activities of our politicians, our administrators, perhaps even without false modesty, with the desire to advise the light of our various professional experiences, those who can be the solutions to make sure that the police can really make the expected leap of quality, both from the social and economic point of view, in a really worrying time, because the police that people need to be listened to by hand."

Of course, the earliest scientific experiment is to define with oxygen. The reaction of oxygen is called oxygenization. It is actually with oxygenization. You know, oxygen is a very good thing for taking the battery. So if you have oxygenization, your battery will be taken away by oxygen. Most elements will be taken away by oxygenation with oxygen. Of course there are exceptions. The exception is that the early scientific experiment did not do so much. It is the process of each oxidation. is the ratio of the carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So if the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide, then the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is the ratio of carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is or the reaction of the oxygenization rate increases, which is called the reaction of oxygenation. Let's take a look at the second example, the change of the green energy, then we know that green energy is also the same as the green energy, then the green energy and the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of the green energy, then the change of but if you use half the reaction, it is lost two electrons, so the last wide-angle is the reaction of the increase in the number of oxygen or the reaction of the loss of the battery, of course, the two of these are more wide-angle with oxygen or battery, you see that the second step and the third step are obviously not oxygen, but the first is the first use oxygen, of course, there is its vacuum background"

Those are just some of the thoughts. I can remember many times, you know, I'm quite tall. That's true. you know I'd give her a hug and I'd pick her up. And her says, you know you might hurt her back so be careful. So from then on it was as soon as I'd hit the door, get out on your knees so I can kiss you.

No, but I asked hers. I'm not going to tell a funny story. She was part of my life. Always, always, always, always. And Laura's talked about the gifts that she gives. And I call it my oh wow syndrome. To which my husband will attest. the ability to bring life in and find the joy in everything.

Его могут обеспечить только высококачественные топливные фильтры. Пыль, вода и различные частицы могут попасть в топливо при его производстве транспортировки и хранении. Эти загрязнения приводят к износу и коррозии чувств. и требованиям качества топлива. Благодаря недавно созданному многослойному материалу мультигрейт фильтр и ман очищают топливо от мельчайших частиц почти на 100 процентов. Это означает, что мультигрейт позволил добиться уровня фильтрации, о котором раньше можно было только мечтать. Обеспечивая высочайший уровень очистки топлива, фильтр и ман повышают мощность двигателя и защищают системы впрыска от повреждений и коррозии. Фильтры низкого качества отличаются целым рядом недостатков. Например, грубый фильтрующий материал пропускает мелкие частицы. Кроме того, у таких фильтров низкая поглощающая способность, поэтому их приходится заменять чаще. Забитый фильтр препятствует поступлению топлива, так что в результате машина может просто не завестись. Наконец, фильтрующий материал может порваться, и топлива попадет в систему впрыска практически неочищенным. В разрыве фильтрующего материала грязное топливо может повредить форсунки и вызвать серьезный износ инжекторной системы. Это приведет к нарушению процессов прыска и снижению мощности двигателя. Но при использовании фильтров MAN такое не случится. Кроме того, они обладают свойством важным для дизельных двигателей, очищая топливо от воды. Многослойный материал мутигрейд отфильтровывает практически всю воду, содержащуюся в топливе. в коллектор, откуда выводится с помощью дренажного устройства. Это позволяет надежно защитить инжекторную систему от коррозии. Фильтры низкого качества часто плохо задерживают воду, она просто проходит сквозь них. Затем вода вместе с топливом поступает в систему впрыска. В результате нарушается процесс горения смеси и возникает коррозия, поскольку даже небольшое количество воды быстро приводит к повреждениям чувствительной инжекторной системы. Еще одно важное требование к фильтру для дизельного топлива. Он должен сохранять работа способность и при очень низких температурах. Холод вызывает в дизельном топливе кристаллизацию парафина, который может забить обычный фильтр. Фильтры MAN предотвращают это, возвращая фильтр подогретую топливу. Специальный элемент, встроенный во многие фильтры, контролирует температуру топлива и обеспечивает оптимальную смесь подогретого топлива и топлива. и фильтр MAN. Фильтры MAN обладают высокой, поглощающей способностью. Обеспечивают оптимальную очистку от загрязнения, практически полную очистку от воды. Идеальную температуру топлива и значит долгую жизнь двигателя. MAN фильтр это качество фильтра конвейерной комплектации, полный ассортимент, доступность для покупателя.","The engines of modern cars are distinguished by the highest efficiency. But in order to get full response from them and avoid damage of the injector systems, the fuel is extremely clean. It can only be provided with high-quality fuel filters. The dust, water and various particles can be absorbed into the fuel when it is produced, transported and stored. These dirt leads to wear and corrosion of the feelings. and all the details of the engine, which is washed off by fuel. Therefore, the fuel should be as clean as possible. This can be achieved only by installing a high-quality filter. All particles of dirt are settled on the filter element and only a clean fuel is entered into the engine. The filter must be changed regularly. Then the fuel cleaning will be optimal. The Man filters are the most modern fuel filter. of the fuel quality. Thanks to the multilayer material, multigrade, the filter man cleans the fuel from the smallest particles almost 100%. This means that multigrade has allowed to achieve the level of filtration, which was previously only possible to dream of. By providing the highest level of fuel cleaning, the filter man increases the engine power and protects the system from damage and corrosion. The filters of low quality are different from the other. For example, the rough filtering material is passed through small particles. In addition, such filters have a low absorption ability, so they have to be replaced more often. The clogged filter prevents the entry of fuel, so the car may not start. Finally, the filtering material may break and the fuel will enter the system of the injection practically unremitting. Due to the explosion of the filter of the material, the dirty fuel can damage the injector and cause serious wear of the injector system. This will lead to the violation of the injection process and the reduction of the power of the engine. But this will not happen when using man filters. In addition, they have properties that are important for diesel engines, they clean the fuel from the water. The multi-layered material of the multigrid is filtered almost all the water contained in the fuel. It is used to protect the injector system from corrosion. The filters of low quality often do not hold water well. It just passes through them. Then the water enters the system with fuel. As a result, the process of burning the mixture is violated and corrosion arises. Because even a small amount of water quickly leads to the damage of the sensitive injector system. Another important requirement for diesel fuel is the ability to save fuel and at very low temperatures. Cold causes paraffin crystallization in diesel fuel, which can clog the usual filter. Man filters prevent this, by returning the fuel to the heated fuel. Special element built in many filters controls the temperature of the fuel and provides the optimal mixture of heated fuel and fuel. And here is what can happen with filters without an element controlling the temperature. Since the fuel does not heat without circulation, it becomes viscous. In addition, there are crystal and paraffin in it. They get into the filter and clog it up. The fuel gradually stops entering the injection system. The engine loses power and is clogged. Make the right choice for your engine. The filter man has a high absorption ability. It provides optimal cleaning from dirt, almost full cleaning of water. The ideal temperature of the fuel means long life of the engine. Man Filter is the quality of the conveyor belt, full assortment, availability for buyers."

Bij maaiwerkzaamheden in de berm op de A32 tussen Leeuwarden en Heerenveen ter hoogte van Akkrum was de rechtrijstrook afgesloten. Toen de chauffeuse in haar spiegels keek merkte zij op dat een vrachtwagen met onverminderde vaart op de rechterrijstrook bleef rijden.  Omdat een aanrijding onvermijdelijk was gaf zij vol gas en stuurde de pijlwagen richting de vluchtstrook. Hier waren op dat moment zeker twee collega's met o.a. een handmaaier aan het maaien. Door deze actie ving zij met haar vrachtwagen de klap op en redde hiermee het leven van de twee collega's.   Door de klap belande de andere vrachtwagen in de linker vangrail. Een achter oprijdende passagiersbus kon op tijd stoppen. Bij de aanrijding raakte uiteindelijk niemand gewond. De weg is lange tijd afgesloten geweest voor bergingswerkzaamheden. Het verkeer werd over het naastgelegen tankstation omgeleid.,"Jaring Rispens, Akkrum, JRF Producties",96676,46,11,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/x87T-962NRY.mp3,"Ik zag geen spiegel zien wat op me afkom en die ging niet op zij. De vooraandeuiding, dat gaf allemaal aan dat ze dus naar Rijstrok 1 moest. Ik stond op Rijstrok 2. En zo in één, hij kwam dichterbij en dichterbij. Ik denk dat ik daar niet ga redden. Dus ik trok de vrachtwagen om naar de berm. En ik denk dan heb ik de mensen twee mensen levens gered. Zit dan alleen in elkaar, maar oké, de schade is het overzien. En ja, de schrik staat er even goed in. Wat voor werkzaamheden werden jullie gedaan? Maar als u er niet was geweest, hoe had dit dan anders afgelopen? Hoe groot was de klap? Je weet dat er niemand opklapt, maar wat het gevoel daarin is, nee, dat komt pas later. Van oh, is dit gebeurd? Maar ik vond het ook zonde om die auto in elkaar te zetten. Dus ik denk nee, dat gaat niet gebeuren. Kon je zelf uit de auto komen? Ja hoor, ik ben gelijk uitgestapt en gekeken wat er aan de hand was. Dus chauffeur van die andere wagen kwam gelijk naar me toe lopen en ja, hoe is het? Ja, ik zou trillen een beetje, maar ja, dat zou ook een normale reactie wezen. Je staat niet vrolijk uit van, dit heb we even gedaan. Nee, dus ja, ik was vrij nuchter en rustig onder de situatie.","I saw someone in the mirror come off and he didn't go on his side. The forehand was all about the fact that he had to go to the railing. I was on the railing too. He came closer and closer. I thought we're not going to save him. So I drove the freight car to the farm. I think I saved at least two people's lives. We're all in one place, but the damage is visible. The shriek is in there. What kind of work were you doing? They found the bots in America. They are in the Netherlands now. You can never stay alert enough. You can look in your mirrors and you can get distracted. But that saves lives. If you weren't there, how did this change? I was convinced that it would have been the same. You know where the trick is now. I just drove more and more. You know that no one is going to notice, but what it feels like... No, it just comes later. Oh, is this what happened? But I thought it was also a shame to put that car in front of me, so I think, no, that's not going to happen. Could you get out of the car yourself? Yes, I immediately got out and looked at what was going on. So the driver of that other car came right after me and said, yes, how is it? Yes, I said a little bit of thrill, but that would also be a normal reaction. You don't look happy about this, we did it. No, I was quite nervous and calm during the situation."

Если ваш врач отмечает, что во время беременности у вас есть угроза, прерывание на маленьком сроке или, допустим, угроза самопроизволенного позднего выкидыша на более поздних сроках, конечно, тогда а сексия не может быть речи. Если ваша беременность проходит хорошо без осложнений, главная девять беременности — это беременность. Веримность не болезнь, поэтому заниматься сексом в реймберимности можно, если ваш врач не имеет каких-либо к этому противопоказаниями. Медицинскими противопоказаниями для сексов в реймберимности является угроза, прерывание беременности, укрочение шейки матки, особенности расположения плаценты, такие как низкая плацентация или предлежание плаценты, когда любая физическая нагрузка, в том числе и секс, может приводить к освещению плаценты и вызвать кровотечение. в от сексуальной активности женщины еще и до беременности.

Если беременность пациентки осложняется различными проблемами, возможно необходима госпитализация, пациентка принимает различные медикаментовственные препараты, ей показаны, допустим, ограничения физических нагрузок, то соответственно и сексуальное отношение, если они и будут разрешены врачом, будут иметь свои особенности, и влечение будет снижаться. Что касается вопроса о том, может ли оргазом во время беременности вызвать предвременные руды, конечно же нет. Если беременность опять же протекает без осложнений и все в порядке, то оргазом абсолютно не вредит течение беременности и не способствует стимуляции родовой деятельности. Если бы было бы все так просто, наверное пациентки бы не и врачи не предпринимали бы различных методов воздействия для стимуляции родовой деятельности в отделении патологии родильных домов. На самом деле оргазм не влияет на вызов родов и не способствует этому.

If your doctor notes that during pregnancy you have a threat of breaking up at a small period, or, let's say, the threat of the most successful late delivery on more late periods, then of course, sex cannot be a rite. If your pregnancy is going well without complications, the main thing to keep in mind is to keep in mind If your doctor does not have any symptoms, you can do it. Medical symptoms for sexual pregnancy are the weight, the breakage of pregnancy, the reduction of the mother's neck, the availability of placenta, such as low placentation or the length of the placenta. When any physical load, including sex, can lead to placenta displacement and the reduction of the number of placenta. to cause a blood flow. Or if the patient has a risk of breaking, the tonus of the mother will be strengthened. This is also a result of various complications. If the patient feels well during pregnancy and the pregnancy flows smoothly, then sexual relations during pregnancy do not have any negative impact. It is believed that during pregnancy there is a criminal reconstruction of the body, as a result of which there is a blood filling of the body of the small basin, due to the fact that the main function of the The function of pregnancy is to grow a fruit in the mother's womb, so we celebrate significant increase in the blood flow in the mother's womb and the effect of placental blood flow. That is, this is a blood flow that feeds the child due to what happens to his face. Therefore, of course, during pregnancy, due to such changes, the patient can feel the increase in sexual treatment. If we ask the question about how to achieve this during the pregnancy of the orgasm, is it difficult? It is also important to know that the patient is not only active in the period of pregnancy, but also in the period of sexual activity of the woman before pregnancy. Of course, if the patient is good, she is wonderful, she brings up pregnancy, works actively, does physical exercise, rest, then sexual attraction does not change or increases. If the pregnancy of the patient is complicated, various problems, perhaps a need for hospitalization, the patient takes various medical drugs. If they are allowed to be a doctor, they will have their own characteristics and the treatment will be reduced. As for the question of whether orgasm can cause premature ruses, of course not. If pregnancy is again flowed without complications and everything is fine, then orgasm absolutely does not harm the flow of pregnancy and does not stimulate the organ activity. If everything were so simple, probably the patient would not be able to do it. and doctors would take various methods of action to stimulate the birth activity in the distribution of pathology of birth homes. In fact, orgasm does not affect the call of the relatives and does not contribute to this. Different types of sex during pregnancy, if there is no contraindication from the side of your doctor, you feel well, of course, allowed. As for the pose during sex, if the patient is engaged during pregnancy, everything depends, of course, on the period of pregnancy. If it is 40 weeks of pregnancy, then certain poses are physically impossible. If it is a short period of pregnancy, if a woman has a good body complexion, if she is not fat, then there are no other evidence. If sex is forbidden, then the patient must find other methods of communication with his husband. You can enjoy the waiting of the pregnancy, because it is a very difficult process. Because, unfortunately, every year children are born. This is a very pleasant moment in the life of a woman. Therefore, even just communication, additional communication, some non-physical and moral contact, spiritual contact can replace sex. It is necessary to remember that if your pregnancy flows calmly without any complications, and at the same time, after sexual contact, you have a severe pain in the abdomen, or blood vessels have appeared, it does not matter at what time it happens. You need to urgently contact your doctor, because this can prevent the threat of premature birth."

Now I'm going to listen to you, to see how it is. Let's take a break and return with Ponte al Día. Let's talk about Aseptia. Aseptia Camouflage for dark skin and Hélspot for light skin. Hélcamouflage for light skin. That annoying little grudge will go unnoticed. Hélspot, transparent gel for darker skin. Aseptia has ended your problems. Hélcamouflage and Hélspot for Aseptia. To improve that lady's look, what do you think about it? That face is a psychiatrist. I want to go to the Farzani focus. What do you mean by focus? You're going to work as a back guard. I just want to talk about football, it's just a need. Jefferson, focus. You're good with your stuff. You are a good father. Adopt me as a son. Wait, wait, but how? If you want, if you want, I paint black. I give the ball if you want. But how are you going to... I always give it to you. You are old, I want to be a kid. You don't get involved, please. The question is not to work. Travel to Bolivia anyway, to peace, to rescue your father. Wait, Dad. Hold on, Dad, I'm going to save you. You should be a good diplomat, you should be able to make a diploma, I say, because you have to do something. That's right. I'm going to Pia Boliva because I don't have the pass. How can you not have money? Your father gave it to me, he gave it to me. You said that I don't have money to buy an entrance to see chess. Look at you, you're like this. You're poorer than the 8th grade. We went with Katy Rojas. How did you go from May to June? You are very good to the public. Well, actually it is my health to start and if you take it to the joke, I really take care of my health and I want you to support me. Of course, you are champion in ornamental jumps. No, the truth is not, absolutely. I felt bad and now I'm fine and that's why I'm with you, I admire you, I see you every day. No one of us are your uncle, right? No, nothing to do with it is Manolo Rojas. My uncle Manolo Rojas, you really have to say, you have to remember the roots, he taught me, thanks to him I stepped on a stage and I send a kiss because yesterday was his special. and they are very happy and they also have their children. And with the pizzeria there is nothing? No. The time is ... well, the pizzeria has already started to be second-planned. Already, already ... well. He asked me. I do not understand how you can faint. For example, here the guys want to hug me. It has happened, it is ... Oh, they fainted. Damn, it is now ... Mr. Armaz, here I have a sudden anguish, I'm going to faint, that's why I want to eat. and I have my coffee. I have been thinking that the red lady has said the gentleman souls and the gentleman life as it is noticeable that they do not know them and the gentleman Rossini is a gentleman You are talking about my student, it can't be. Pancho Tournament, go to Bolivia to look for your father to remove his chivalry. Let's see the final. I swear, the thimbs have already frozen. This chibola is mine! They have come to Motahoo! They have given it to Juita, follow me, follow me! Oh Felipe, you always do something hard! Don't get excited, it's my brother! You're not going to come to Bolivia Pancho, because my driver is cousin brother of Evo Vento, he's going to Motahoo! We don't even have a bread with tuna! I'm walking with a tear at the corner! Don Palsho already traveled to Bolivia, he went directly to Bolivia. Tell Santa Cruz that he goes... Do you know where Santa Cruz is? Santa Cruz, in Bolivia. In Bolivia. No, look, Flore. Why are you blowing? No, nobody blew me here. Who plays in the finals next Sunday? Germany, Spain. Look how she throws the girls. She throws the girls. She's a baller. Let's talk about CicatiQ. CicatiQ and the micro-dermabrasion. Look at the rake, she's the rake, she also supports me. She releases a new skin in only three steps. It's an intensive system for care and regeneration of the skin. She removes wrinkles, spots and scars in three steps. You know it, yes, Catecure. And there is uncertainty, does it play or not? It does not play. The classic university with Ariane Salima. I don't think it plays. And if it plays, what does it play? You think it must be suspended. Please, that situation is horrible, it's ugly, there are many dangers, they are threatened by the internet, it is suspended, that no one plays, that they close the stadium, that they are going to play bowling. We are running in danger, many people. Well, let's see what people think Poor Arbitro, poor Arbitro's sub-picture. Let's win the alliance in your own old field and let's go to the Olympic round in Bantute, go to the EU. The teacher, the country, has been surprised by me, now he has my post, now I went up and my pretensions. No, no, I want to take off the kit, as I told you, and nothing, well, nothing. I am a little fox and they say I smell alone. The first one wins! Well, Alliance has good technique, but it doesn't have good players. If I want the classic, we win. And my countryman, the mountaineer, I'm going to give him a high five. To the players of the Ule, I ask that you don't hit me because I'm going to save the Peruvian football. I'm alone, with humility, always. I'm the best. Up to Alliance. Pico, please, that classic is better. Tomorrow what will Guillermo Rosini do from the... Well, from 10 p.m. that I had the habit of playing my little machine, I want a coffee. What in the house? Crossfire or who?

I have been a manager in the administration, and the work has always prevented me from being entirely dedicated to painting. I have always had it as a background, nothing more than anything else, it was to balance. I need to paint. So I refuse to paint to be myself. He even works with recycled materials. This is something very important for our Well, this is happening in the model of the girls that some artists have already interpreted. Well, I thought about it, I had the idea for a long time, I was saving things and recycling things, and for example the pieces of the leguera, the pieces of the corks, I have the old Amiere of my mother in this case. I started designing the idea and executing it and the result seems to have liked it. I am a collaborator in almost all the works. This one specifically was for Murcia. I made two, I gave one and this one I gave it, I reserved it. The bottom of the painting is I'm not happy with this yet. Would you like to do something else? I'm never happy with this. My brother has to be a conformist in all the fields. One of them is that I have never been able to dedicate myself entirely to painting or to creating. More than painting, it's already creating.

Hvor blir dere consideret med juler i dag? Selv som sitter jeg her og spiser nudler, denne julekvenn. Hvorfor jeg spiser nudler? Spur til dere. Jo, det er jo fordi at jeg ikke har noe smaksans igjen etter alle de medisine dere har gitt meg. Mange år. Alt fra Risperdal til Cyprexa. til trillafon, abilify, heteronax, soloft, pluss en rekke sovemediciner, og ingen av disse mediciner har virket ingen av dem. Og nå sitter jeg her på jordekværlen helt, måka leine, ensam, og venter i mange timer på at søstrammet skulle komme og besøke meg helt fra bergen. Men hun kommer ikke. Vet dere hvorfor? Ja, det vet dere nok. Inni skjinde i deres lille helvete. Det er fordi at jeg søster min er rett for å komme. Hun er rett for å besøke meg. Hun er rett for hva som kan vente når hun kommer. Like mye som jeg er rett for hva som kan vente hende når hun kommer. For jeg har nemlig ingen kontroll over sinne mitt lenge. For grunn av alle pillene dere har gitt meg. så dukker disse frykkle stemmen opp, eller disse skygene på veggen, som forteller meg at jeg skal passe meg på min egen søste. Hun er ikke til å stole på. Hun er fremmet for deg. Hun vil deg ingenting godt. Og så videre. Og vet dere, psykratere og legerne, sånn var det ikke før, før dere begynte å dote meg ned med alle visse medicine. Da kunne jeg tenke klart, første gang jeg kom til dere, så hadde jeg ingen sinslirelse. Jeg kom til dere fordi jeg var en ensam og rett skjel som trengte noen å betre meg til, til å forstå meg, forstå min ensamhetsfølelse, forstå min sorg over den mannen jeg miste og alle de tankene hadde. Det var rundt dette å miste en jeg var glad i. Men dere hadde ingen tid til å høre på meg. Det første dere spurte meg om, det var om jeg hadde gått på medicine før. Jeg sa nei. Også liker jeg det på. Etter et kvarter så kom dere to, deg som psykrat og dere som overleget, til en konklusjon at jeg skulle sette Spariss Per Dalmedesin. Jeg visste ikke hva Risper Dal var. Dere forklarte meg at det hadde noe med sinslirse å gjøre. Sinslirse er jeg. Jeg har ingen sinslirse. Jeg føler meg ensam, da de er jeg føler meg. Jeg er mye sorgig og jeg føler meg ensam. Jeg trenger rett og slett noen å prate med. Og jeg kan høre en knappe nål faller om natten jeg sitter våken i sorgig over mammen som jeg mista, fortalte av dere. Jeg sa at jeg kunne høre en knappe nål falle med jennklang på gullet mitt. At dere fant ut at jeg lede av en sinselilse. Fra å være en sinselilse, så fant jeg ut at jeg hadde en paranoid sinselilse fordi at jeg motsatte med dere og sa at jeg følte dere gjorde dette her, satte meg på mediciner bare for å dope meg ned. og tjene penger på medicinene deres. For jeg sa det til dere, så gader dere meg enda flere medicinene. Dere satte gang og gik meg suprexa, abilify, pluss en rekkesov- medicinere, aeronox for eksempel. Og så begynte jeg å få bivirkninger, store bivirkninger. Så sa dere til meg, det hadde gått et år at dette skulle ikke være bekymret for, for dette ville gå over alle disse bivirkeningene. Men det var jo ingenting som gikk over. Det ble jo bare å være og være. Så plusset jeg begynte å se alle disse fruktle skjigene, disse skremmende svarte skjigene på veggen hver eneste dag. Plus at jeg hørte disse fruktle stemmene i rommet. Skremmende stemmer. Og dere mente det bare ville være en forbi- og nedbi-virkning. De hadde godt en stund, sa dere, så ville den bivirkningen forsvinne. Men det forsvant aldri. Så ble jeg bare sykere og sykere. Så fikk jeg diabetes, sukkesjukken for høyt på lotrykk. Jeg miste av balansegangen. Og jeg fikk sjelvinger i kroppen. I kraften er det vekt. Fikk store vektapp. Og da fant dere plutsel ut dere, psykratere og leger, og så fikk jeg enda større bivirkninger. Og så sa dere igjen, ja, men dette går jo bort. Om en stund, men det vil ta tid, men det vil gå seg til. I gjen så fikk jeg høre dette her, at det ville gå seg til, at bivirkningene ville gradis forsvinne, men det ville ta tid. Og det sa dere akkurat den gangen. Når jeg fikk det, så var det en gang. begynte å få bivirkninger av disse ferdige medicine deres, at de ville gå seg til at de ville forsvinne. Vet dere? Dere leger og psykratere. Jeg hadde bivirkninger i syv år. Helt siden der begynte å dop med ned med disse medicine.","Good Christmas, your psychiatrist and doctor is out there. I hope you will consider Christmas today. Even though I'm here to eat noodles, it's Christmas Eve. Why do I eat noodles? Ask them. Well, because I don't have any taste again after all your medicines have given me. Many years. Everything from risper dal to sepprexa. to Trilaphone, Abilify, Ederonax, Soloft Plus enough sleeping medicine, and none of these medicines have worked, none of them And now I'm sitting here on the earth all alone, alone, waiting for my sister to come visit me all the way from Bergen But she's not coming I know why, I know that enough, inside the silence in your little hell. And that is because my sister is afraid to come, she is afraid to visit me, she is afraid of what she can wait when she comes, just as much as I am afraid of what she can wait when she comes. Because I have no control over my mind for a long time, because of all the pills you have given me. And when I was in the hospital, these ugly voices were heard. Or these shivers on the wall that tell me that I should take care of my own sister. She is not even a chair on her. She is a stranger to you. She doesn't want anything good. And so on. And you know, psychiatrists and doctors, that wasn't before. Before they started to die, I could think clearly. The first time I came to you, I had no sense of purpose. I came to you because I was a lonely and afraid soul that needed someone to trust me to understand me, understand my loneliness. Understand my concern over the man I lost and all those thoughts I had. I was around, this and that, and I was happy. But you didn't have time to listen to me. The first thing you asked me was if I had gone to the doctor before. I said no. And then, after a quarter, you two came, you as a psychiatrist and you as a doctor, to a conclusion that I should put on a sparrisper. I didn't know what the hospital was. You explained that you had something to do with the kidney disease. Kidney disease? I don't have any kidney disease. I feel lonely when I feel it. I feel very sad and lonely. I need someone to talk to. And I can hear a knock on the door when I'm awake at night. I'm not sad about my mother who I missed. Tell me about that. I could hear a knock on my door, with my heart beating fast. I found out I was led by a ghost. From being a ghost, I found out I had a paranoid ghost, because I was against you. I felt you doing this, and you were on medicine, just to knock me down. and earn money on their medicines. Because I said that to you, you gave me even more medicines. You gave me a lot of money, a lot of money, suddenly enough sleeping medicines, Adronox for example. And then I started to get big side effects. So you told me, it would have been a good year, that this would not be a concern for me. This is why I want to go over all these bee effects. But nothing went over. I just got to be and be. Suddenly I started to see all these fruit trees, these black black trees on the wall, every single day. Plus I heard these fruit trees in the room, these fruit trees. And you mean that it just wants to be a forgotten bee effect. They had a good time, Sadre, so the bi-effects disappeared. But never disappeared. Then I was just safe and safe. Then I got diabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure. I lost balance. And I got cell problems in my body. My body was gone. I had a big weight loss. And then suddenly I found out, you guys, psychiatry and medicine, I was on my way to the hospital and I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the sight of the disease. I was surprised by the They began to get the effects of these disease, and they wanted to go to the point where they wanted to disappear. You know, you are a doctor and a psychiatrist. I had the effects in seven years. The whole disease began to dip me into these diseases."

Alok Jha      The Observer, Sunday 25 October 2009   In 2006 the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management published recommendations on how the UK should dispose of nuclear waste. A key idea was that long-term disposal would be best carried out by identifying suitable sites at which the waste could be buried, a process called deep geological disposal.  The conclusions were used by the government to bolster the case for the building of new nuclear power stations. But Gordon MacKerron, chair of the committee until 2007, said the recommendations were meant for legacy waste and were not a ""carte blanche"" to think that radioactive waste from a new generation of power plants could be dealt with in the same way.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/oct/25/experts-condemn-nuclear-waste-plan  Fukushima fallout caused significant increase in baby deaths? http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/node/4550  http://rt.com/usa/fukushima-us-children-thyroid-291/  2012/07/13 5 pregnancy out of 7 became birth defect, Down's syndrome or miscarriage in Fukushima  Original text from a blog of a person who had evacuated to Kyûshû from Fukushima http://blog.goo.ne.jp/fukushine777/e/59990a16a6da28d81cca92fd7d1008a8 2012 June 13 Someone I know finally moved out of Fukushima to Mie (middle west of Japan). I wasn't close to her, but she told me a major incident occurred that inspired her to be scared of radiation.  At a hospital in Fuksuhima where she was working in, 5 babies out of 7 were born with birth defect, Down's syndrome or lost by miscarriage.  2 Down's syndrome 1 born with 6 fingers 1 anencephalia 1 miscarriage  2 other infants were 4 months old old at the time. They have been followed over time.   Speaking in terms of probability, it's hardly possible this happens in a same hospital. This terrified her. With experts' knowledge and experiences, it reached the conclusion that this was associated with radiation.  After this, her husband finally agreed and her family evacuated home. (...) I personally know three women who lost a baby by miscarriage only in this year (June or July), and they were not caring of the food safety. The only considerable cause (at least for me) is radioactivity taken in with foodstuffs....  http://dissensus-japan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/5-pregnancy-out-of-7-became-birth.html  Help us caption & translate this video!  http://amara.org/v/CMcZ/",,471,8,3,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/zha9qoMPYT0.mp3,"Alright guys, just want to take you to this. Now what we've got is basically almost a third of US West Coast newborns hit with thyroid problems after Fukushima nuclear disaster and that's because in the West in America they do blood tests on all thyroid all children all babies basically for thyroid abnormalities or hypothyroidism so basically The party has reported this and it was on April 3rd 2013. I'm going to leave a link to it so you can read that for yourself. I brought this up because they're saying that the West Coast got hit by Iodine 131 from Fukushima increasing hypothyroidism in children. And of course we're looking at a medical reactor going off in Europe. So I just wanted to bring you to this article. Let me just see so if we go to this particular article here, I'll just zoom in a little bit and Fox news ID 131 causing infant deaths in Philadelphia And then there's some issue around whether when this story first broke whether it's Fukushima or whether it was local medical Isotopes that were doing the job so basically the is I wanted to bring you to this one particularly because it is sort of saying this is medical. This is a reactor we make for chemotherapy. These are waste producers or they're the products coming out of the patients into the water supply, one of the two or both. So basically there has been a problem, it was reported. And there was a quite a 48% increase in the death rate of babies. since Iodine 131 was found in Philadelphia's drinking water but it had been since 2005 and we haven't got the stats to match up the infant deaths with the other other peaks and troughs of Iodine 131 so I was just going to take you to those two articles and then I'm going to go straight to this if it works alright okay information regarding stillbirths I'll read it off at the top anyway and I'll be putting an article up with the picture of this so you can read it for yourself. This is also from the West Hervford hospital, basically the Wattford hospital NHS Trust. And it's a thank you for your request for information. I am pleased to provide the following responses listed below so statistics for infants that are stillborn last five years starting 2007 2012 Now the actual stillborn statistics They kind of show that it was a bit of a peak in 2009-10 and And then basically a drop-off 2010-11 and then slight rise 2011-12. I mean kind of looking at the sort of averages there. I mean we're certainly seeing an increase I would say but nothing nothing as definitive as we had with the respiratory. However when I bring you down to this bit and I'll just zoom out I just want to make sure you get all that so that's statistics for the the last five years. Right, okay. And basically that's from 2007 to 2012. Now, in 2007 and 2008, where we were getting low respiratory issues, we were getting 283 people having miscarriages from this particular hospital. And there's a lot of hospitals in the UK. So that's quite an issue. And 2008, 2009, We're getting an increase, it goes up about 100 in this particular hospital. And then it increases again, about another 80 or so. And then 2010 and 11 we have a little drop. So maybe we have that correlation there between the high in stillbirths of 34, which is statistically significant in 2009, and a drop obviously afterwards, which we saw, but the drop wasn't too drastic, but the increase to 535, that certainly is drastic in 2011 to 2012. And I think that is statistically significant. And the increases year on year are statistically significant when matched up with the data and bearing in mind the outputs from these MOCs facilities and the medical facilities. I'm going to leave it at that. I'm going to keep this short. I'm going to put this up. I'm going to put links to it. You can have a look at this stuff yourself. I'll put a link also to UC Berkeley who having a discussion about the Iodine 131 killing babies and all the things that was about. Also some great information in there about how to protect yourself which will I'm just going to leave you with that. It's quite shocking statistics and a big heads up to Jamnoy72 for the link for her video. She does some great research. She's done some absolutely fantastic research here. It correlates perfectly with Fukushima. It would be interesting to see the 2012 statistics as well. Of course we don't know if this is from, we presume this is from January to January, not from April to April, but not 100% sure about that if I get clarification I'll let you know. But the stats themselves sort of, they do speak for themselves I think and there was something in 2009 and 10 worth bearing in a little investigation on I suspect. Alright well thanks a lot for your time and effort of watching the video and if you're interested have a look at a few of the other videos more importantly do some investigation for yourself on air quality in Europe and it will turn up some quite amazing statistics which we're not being told about. There's a sort of a limit on to how much the papers can say about this for many different reasons. The UK could get farmed by the Olympic committee and so on and so forth one and it's you know there's a lot of corporate reasons why we don't want to be told that mox is very dirty for our atmosphere and it's you know it's killing things and making people unwell. Okay all right well I thought I'd leave it with that I think that's it enough of me.","Alright guys, just want to take you to this.
