Dabei entstanden auch etliche Video-Interviews, die der 14-jährige Felix Bröckling aus Köln führte.  Felix entdeckt darin -- vielleicht stellvertretend für andere deutsche Jugendliche -- viele Themen, die auf den Philippinen aktuell sind und den Menschen dort auf den Nägeln brennen. Die Aussagen, die seine Gesprächspartner machen, sind aktuell und vor allem sehr authentisch. Denn es ist sinnvoll nicht nur ÜBER die Philippinen und ihre Herausforderungen zu reden, sondern möglichst auch MIT Filipinas und Filipinos. Ihnen und ihrer Sicht der Dinge zuzuhören ist eine seltene Chance zum Verständnis.   Die Videos sind mit deutschen Untertiteln versehen.

What about them? pit mining which is bulldozing the whole mountain and cutting all the trees. So we're trying to stop that. And we have a campaign here with rallies on the street and many other actions to pressure the government here and the foreign governments to intervene and to control this mining activity and even stop it. Now in the Philippines there is a food crisis. rice shortages, the seas are overfished, and how do you think about this situation? The reason of the rice shortage is the lack of government assistance to farmers, a lot of corruption. Money that was given to improve the rice production was stolen by government officials. Another, the international commodity Dealers have also increased the price, which means that here in the Philippines, the price has risen so high, the poor people cannot afford. Rice has increased by one-third in the last two years. And this is international manipulation by multinational corporations. It's not just a local problem here, so the international community is also involved in this. And another one is the urbanization of land, building and constructing, no, on rice land, which has reduced the area of coverage. The failure of government to help farmers, you know, who are very poor to produce rice, that's part of the problem. The urbanization, many people know jobs, there is no future for them to plant food and rice. cities looking for jobs. And so they live there in very bad conditions in a slum area. But the land is left undeveloped, uncultivated. Another problem with the government is giving land to multinational corporations to grow food for export to other countries abroad. So they are growing food for Saudi Arabia, for Korea, but they're not growing food for the people of the Philippines. So the use of land or the misuse of land in a giving it away to others is a corrupt know a very corrupt action and they are Caused in a great part of this hunger and poverty in the Philippines And just pray I fight against this Well, we have yeah what we do at Prada for this is to try to support Farmers organizations as I said earlier the indigenous people The Pacific Ocean is nearly overfished. Do you feel the effects of the overfishing here? The history of the Philippines is a big problem. You've got to over fishing, but it's over fishing by foreign fishing fleets. Here, the majority of the fishing folk or the people have only small boats. They cannot go into the far ocean of Philippine waters, no? They only can do coastal fishing. And the amount of fish in the coastal area is less and less because of pollution. The water is damaged, the fish don't grow, the coral reef is damaged as well, so the fish do not propagate close to the shore. But the poor fishermen can only go just a few kilometers outside into the ocean. The big fishing fleets know it, factory ships, they come here from Taiwan, from Japan, to far other countries and they are getting all the fish from the Philippine waters. Most of the rainforests have been cut away in the last 60, 70 years. So that has caused lots of problems as regarding landslides. You know that the mountains are eroding, the soil is washing into the ocean, and that is polluting the ocean and depleting the quality of the soil. This is a major problem here. Therefore, the climate is also with global warming. It's also impacting here. We have more violent storms now and more frequent storms bashing the Philippines. Floods, no, have been destroying property, no. Much more could be done here in the planting of rainforests, which is a work that we have prayed our doing. The most we can do to alleviate global warming is planting and planting more and more trees. And we also encourage alternative forms of energy. and opposing coal plants. We are trying to oppose the generation of electricity from burning of fossil fuels, oil and coal, and we are encouraging the use of solar power and wind power, but the government is not very interested in this.","And what about the mining and human rights of the indigenous people, the AITAS?

Foi com essas expectativas que os participantes chegaram ao primeiro Fórum Regional de Defesa dos Direitos da Pessoa com Deficiência. Antes do início das discussões, um grupo de dançaria nos de São Leopoldo apresentou uma coreografia. O diferencial é que um dos integrantes é deficiente visual. Mas para ele, não há de dificuldades. do Estado, do Rio do Sul, do Brasil, do mundo. Agora nós estamos então em um processo importante que é o avanço das políticas sociais, sempre num olhar emancipatório, compreendendo a pessoa com deficiência como protagonista da história, de si própria, alguém que pode realmente ser como cidadão, de fato, alguém que tenha acesso a todas as políticas sociais, a participação em todas as atividades. O objetivo do evento foi o de promover a troca de experiência e incentivar para que mais pessoas se envolvam com as questões de melhorias para pessoas com deficiência. uma mobilização do Estado para a melhoria dessas questões referentes a pessoas com deficiência.

We have a expectation to know more about how this policy works for the efficiency holders, so that we can help more in the community where we work, to know how to rescue the link with these efficiency holders. We are looking for a little more experience about the rights of people with disabilities. I hope that I learn more about It was with these expectations that the participants arrived at the first regional defense forum of the right of the person with disabilities. Before the beginning of the discussions, a group of dancers from São Leopoldo presented a choreography. The differential is that one of the members is a visual defect. But for him, there is no difference between the two. I can't find a difficulty because people who are with me are very capable, very well trained to help me. But we just want to trust the moment. During the event, plans and projects were presented that predict improvements for public policies for people with disabilities. For the president of the Articulation Foundation for Development of Public Policy for People with Disabilities, the progress is constant. Today's social inclusion is a big topic. of the State, of the South, of Brazil, of the world. Now we are in an important process, which is the advance of social policies, always looking at emancipation, understanding the person with efficiency as the protagonist of history, of this own, someone who can really be like a citizen, in fact, someone who has access to all social policies, participation in all activities. The goal of the event was to promote the exchange of experience to encourage more people to get involved in improving people's efficiency. In fact, a movement like this strengthens the movement, depending on the discussions and changes of experience that will happen here, because each municipality, due to its specificity, will also have its difficulties. For example, what is good in São Neopoldo? We will put it here so that it can also be and other municipalities. Together we will also invite other municipalities to create new advice so that this, increasingly, will change the lives of people with disabilities and their families. In a meeting held in November 2011, Rio Grande do Sul was divided into five micro-regions to discuss public policies for people with disabilities. This is the second region that makes the meeting. And for the authorities present here, this represents a state mobilization to improve these issues related to people with disabilities. Among the micro-regions are Carazinho, São Leopoldo, Dom Pedrito, Caxias do Sul and São Luiz Gonzaga. Each municipality was responsible for the cities in which it is part of. 65 municipalities, for example, are responsible for São Leopoldo. and also national in the issue of the person with the deficiency. So we develop the main accessibility in our whole, in access to the buildings, to the buses, to work, health, education. Anyway, everything that refers to accessibility of the person with the deficiency, this work territory. There are many things to be done, but I believe that through work, through the commitment that people have, I believe that we will I managed to advance."

For some the great products that we're now building, we give our students an opportunity to actually look at, touch, see the styling, understand the quality of the product.

Each year we've given out a scholarship to one of the team-focused graduates and we got all of our subsidiary companies to join us in participating. And so we've raised the level of scholarships and we'll be presenting two this year to two well-deserving young men. And in view of the tragedy to the Hendrick Motorsports Organization this past year, we decided to rename this scholarship the Ricky Hendrick Memorial Scholarship and make it perpetual and give it out every year. of GMAC and it is presented to Shao Wei Lam.

We really wish that every one of our employees could participate on-site because it truly is a wonderful experience. We have team focus comes to your city. Volunteer to participate. We'll be in eight cities next year so it'd be a great opportunity to go and see exactly what type of impact that has on the local community. Each year we've given out a scholarship to one of the team-focused graduates and we got all of our subsidiary companies to join us in participating. And so we've raised the level of scholarships and we'll be presenting two this year to two well-deserving young men. And in view of the tragedy to the Hendrick Motorsports Organization this past year, we decided to rename the scholarship the Ricky Hendrick Memorial Scholarship and make it perpetual and give it out every year. of GMAC and it is presented to Shao Wei Lam. Shao Wei Lam calls giving back to the community quite simply the right thing to do and give back he does to the tune of three million dollars over the last 12 years. At the GMAC Bowl we're pleased to have Shao Wei Lam as the 2004 champion of life. of the book causes. It is an honor for the GMAC Bowl to have Jerry Lane as a champion of life. Thank you for our partnership with our city and bringing this to America."

Toutes disent que l'espéranto est très facile à comparer aux autres langues et qu'elle est 10 fois plus facile à apprendre que l'anglais ou d'autres langues nationales. Mais comment cela est-il possible ? Voyons comment ça fonctionne. et l'amour, substantif, non commun, et il est notre premier mot. En espérantant, la lettre J se prononce «IE » et en final il indique le pluriel. À moi les amours. À ! Tous les adjectifs qui s'adjoignent au nom en exprimant une qualité se terminent par la lettre à. À moi, amour propre à l'amour. Et notre troisième mot. Les adverbes dérivés qui indiquent une manière ou une circonstance Tout les verbaux infinitifs prennent la terminaison I, AMI et MAIS. Tu aimes, il aime, nous aimons, vous aimez, ils aiment, elles aiment. c'est 10 finales de base de l'espéranto pour chaque mot et le transformer ainsi en 10 nouveaux mots. Donc le secret de la facilité de l'espéranto réside dans sa grammaire régulière qui ne comporte aucune exception et dans sa grande souplesse de formation du vocabulaire. Et si nous ajoutons un préfixe à ce mot ? Mal est le préfixe qui indique le contraire de l'idée transmise par le radical du mot. Nous avons déjà vu que le substantif à mot signifie amour. Et nous pouvons appliquer ici encore des 10 finales précédentes, et ainsi former 10 mots nouveaux autour de l'idée de la n. Donc nous voyons Au lieu d'un prefix, nous pouvons aussi mettre un suffix, un bout du mot se plaçant à sa fin. L'augmentation de l'amour serait l'amour fou. Et nous pouvons toujours appliquer les 10 finales de base, formant 10 nouveaux mots autour de l'idée du grand amour. Prenons par exemple un verbe, amégas, le verbe chérir au présent. Je chérie, tu chérie, etc. Cela fait déjà 22 mots. Mais on peut aussi utiliser les autres finales, y avoir en tout 30 mots. Nous avons donc vérifié qu'un Esperanto, il est possible de combiner des parties de mots pour former des centaines d'autres mots. Apprendre l'espéranto est ainsi ludique comme faire un jeu de construction. L'espéranto multiplie, là où d'autres langues additionnent. Vous pouvez multiplier chaque nouveau mot à prix par les dix finales de base de l'espéranto et former dix nouveaux mots. Vous pouvez aussi multiplier avec 46 affixes, les préfixes et les suffixes. Pour former 460 mots à partir d'un seul mot à prix. Mais chaque mot peut également avoir plus d'un seul affix, rendant ainsi possible l'utilisation nouvelle des quarantis affixes pour un total de 21 160 mots. A chaque nouveau mot que vous apprenez, votre dictionnaire augmente exponentiellement. L'espéranto démultiplie les mots.

All say that Esperanto is very easy to compare with other languages and that it is 10 times easier to learn than English or other national languages. But how is it possible? Let's see how it works. And the word, not common, and it is our first word. In Esperanto, the letter G is pronounced in the eye, and in the end it indicates the plural. All the adjectives that join a name by expressing a quality, are finished by the letter A. And our third word. All the verbs in the infinitive take the term I, amie, aimé. The U ending, pronounced U, indicates the imperative and conjugation is the same for all people. Amu, that I love, that you love, that he loves. Asse, and the verb ending present. He also conjugates in the same way all the people. Amas, I love. Is and the ending of the conjugated verb you go This is the final 10 of the Esperanto base for each word and it turns into 10 new words. So the secret of the easy of the Esperanto resides in its regular grammar which has no exception and in its great flexibility of vocabulary formation. And if we add a prefix to this word, mal is the prefix that indicates the opposite of the transmissed idea by the radical of the word. We have already seen that the noun amo means amor. And we can apply here again the previous ten final and thus form ten words again around the help of the N. So we see Instead of a prefix, we can put a suffix, a bit of the word that is placed at the end. The increase in love will be the crazy love. And we can always apply the basic 10 final words, forming 10 new words around the idea of ​​the great love. Let's take for example a verb, a megas, the verb to scream at the present. I scream, you scream, etc. It already has 22 words, but we can also use the other final words, there are at least 30 words. We have to verify that in Esperanto, it is possible to combine parts of You can multiply each new word in a row by the 10 final base words of Esperanto and form 10 new words. You can also multiply with 46 affixes, prefixes and suffixes. To form 460 words from one word in a row, each word can also have a different meaning. more than a single affix, thus making it possible to use new affixes for a total of 21,160 words. In each new word that you learn, your dictionary increases exponentially. Esperanto multiplies words.

Since May 2002, Cohan has served as an executive-in-residence at Babson, advising MBA teams in their consulting work with companies through the Babson Consulting Alliance Program (BCAP) and Management Consulting Field Experience (MCFE) programs.    Cohan began his career at Index Systems, a management consulting firm founded by several MIT professors.  While there he worked with James A. Champy, co-author (with former MIT professor, Michael Hammer) of Reengineering the Corporation(HarperBusiness, 1993).   Following business school, Cohan worked at The Monitor Company, a strategy consulting firm co-founded by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter.  Cohan then worked in strategic planning at Bank of Boston and in the Finance Department of Liberty Mutual.    In 1994, Cohan started Peter S. Cohan & Associates, a management consulting and venture capital firm. His management consulting unit helps managers with strategy, best practices, operational improvement, and litigation support.   Cohan has published articles in Business Strategy Review; he writes for two blogs: AOL's BloggingStocks and its DailyFinance; and is the author of a monthly investment-oriented newsletter, The Cohan Letter. Cohan is a frequent commentator in the media on developments in economics, technology, and finance.","Babson, teaching, Peter Cohan, acquisitions",1063,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/0dCn-1bZGRs.mp3,"Hi, I'm Peter Cohen and I'm an executive in residence at Babson or I've been since 2002. In 2005 Babson took a chance and decided to throw me into a classroom and since then I've been teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in business strategy. I've been consulting for about 30 years and one of my first consulting projects was to help a large insurance company do an acquisition of a bunch of different possible financial services firms back in the early 1980s when Sandy Wild at City was creating the concept of the one-stop shopping financial services firm. So I've written an article about acquisitions that I've used both in my undergraduate and graduate courses. And the purpose of the article is to help executives to manage the minefield that is acquisitions. After all, 70% of acquisitions fail, and yet companies have tremendous amounts of cash on their balance sheets right now. They are ready to make acquisitions. Just this weekend Warren Buffett said that he was itching to make some more acquisitions. but as I said, acquisitions have a tendency to fail. 30% of them succeed though, what makes them succeed? Well, this article I've written, which I urge you to read, has four tests for a successful acquisition and based on my experience and the research that I've done, I think that if you follow those four tests, you will have a greater chance of being successful and I urge you to read it and if you have any questions, contact me at Babson. Thank you.","Hi, I'm Peter Cohen and I'm an executive in residence at Babson or I've been since 2002.

Number one if a sister so this is for the people that that pound on women constantly and consistently Don't allow sisters to progress instead. They do exactly the opposite of what the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said laatu'inu shaitanu alayh Don't support a person shaitan against them if a person is wearing hijab that is not complete That does not mean that you can say that they are not wearing hijab That means they're wearing hijab, but there is a flaw in their hijab You cannot say that it's as if you're not wearing hijab, you know, you are not muhajjaba. Okay? That's not appropriate to attack people to that extent, to beat them down. On the other hand, there is a hijab from the Proph- we know what the bounds of hijab are. We know what the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam has legislated as hijab. We're not talking about a difference of opinion of covering the face or covering the hands or covering the feet here. What we know is that it represents modesty. It represents modesty. So it should be loose clothing that does not show the figure of the body, at the same time it should not draw more attraction. Some hijabs, some hijabs actually are a tease. They're more of a tease than they are a covering. Don't do something that would contradict the purpose of the hijab. So wear hijab to fulfill its purpose insha'Allah and at the same time progress. It's not always all in all out. It's not always all in all out. You know, sometimes I'll see a sister who will wear, you know, short shorts, you know, or a skirt. And she's saying one day I want to be a Hijabi, like aspire by getting closer insha'Allah to Allah, start wearing long skirts, start wearing baggy pants, loose pants, start wearing long sleeve and things of that sort. But certainly, so the extremities that we have here, and I apologize Sheikh, I'm taking way too much time. The extremities that we have here is we have one group of people that's acting as if the Hijab does not exist. Then you have another group of people that's judgmental against non-Hijabis. And there's, those are extremities, it's in the middle there. Yes? Allah will look at our insides, but these are manifestations of what is on the inside. These are mandatory actions, okay? So we have to try to act according to the command of Allah, but we've all got our own issues. Let's try to help our sisters, encourage them. One of the greatest things, my mother-in-law, may Allah SWT bless her, what she used to do, they used to actually have parties for every sister that started to wear hijab to encourage them. It's not a bid'ah, it's okay. No one is saying that it's the sunnah to throw a big party and no, but just encourage, encourage each other. Ta'awano ala al-birri wa taqwa. Help each other in obedience and consciousness of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala. Don't beat each other down and make them feel like garbage. Help each other to get there. But don't blur the standard at the same time.","What do you think of hijabies who wear tights? Number one if a sister so this is for the people that that pound on women constantly and consistently Don't allow sisters to progress instead. They do exactly the opposite of what the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said laatu aino shaitanu alayh Don't support a person shaitan against them if a person is wearing hijab that is not complete That does not mean that you can say that they are not wearing hijab That means they're wearing hijab, but there is a flaw in their hijab You cannot say that it's as if you're not wearing hijab, you know, you are not muhajjaba. Okay? That's not appropriate to attack people to that extent to beat them down. On the other hand, there is a hijab from the... We know what the bounds of hijab are. We know what the Prophet Salli alayhi alayhi wa sallam has legislated as hijab. We're not talking about a difference of opinion of covering the face or covering the hands or covering the feet here. What we know is that it represents modesty. It represents modesty. So it should be loose clothing that does not show the figure of the body at the same time it should not draw more attraction. Some hijabs, some hijabs actually are a tease. They're more of a tease than they are a covering. Don't do something that would contradict the purpose of the hijab. So wear hijab to fulfill its purpose insha'Allah and at the same time progress. It's not always all in all out. It's not always all in all out. You know sometimes I'll see a sister who will wear you know short shorts you know or skirt And she's saying one day I want to be a Hijabi, like aspire by getting closer insha'Allah to Allah, start wearing long skirts, start wearing baggy pants, loose pants, start wearing long sleeve and things of that sort. But certainly, so the extremities that we have here, and I apologize Sheikh, I'm taking way too much time. The extremities that we have here is we have one group of people that's acting as if the Hijab does not exist. Then you have another group of people that's judgmental against non-Hijabis. And there's, those are extremities, it's in the middle there. Yes? Allah will look at our insides, but these are manifestations of what is on the inside. These are mandatory actions. Okay? So we have to try to act according to the command of Allah, but we've all got our own issues. Let's try to help our sisters, encourage them. One of the greatest things my mother-in-law, may Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta'ala bless her, what she used to do, they used to actually have parties for every sister that started to wear hijab, to encourage them. It's not a bid'ah, it's okay. No one is saying that it's the sunnah to throw a big party, and no, but just encourage, encourage each other. Ta'awano ala al-birri wa taqwa.

About 360 yard par four from the white tees This is the first hole green Originally the hole had a large tree on the right hand side on the other side of that bunker that came down about 15 years ago that guarded coming in from a power drive off to the right the rough was always kept very very deep here especially in the right and The key here was flying the bunker on the left on your drive to set up an approach going in. There used to be a trap at the very back of the green. They filled that in years ago. And that's really the only change on this hole. That tree off the tee on the right hit people who sliced the ball and hit that. And that's about it. They didn't mess with this one too much. Number two, par-5, short par-5. Really cool hole. That big, ugly red thing in front of you. It used to be there. And that was put up about 15 years ago. main building. The deal here was do you risk going over those bunkers on the right and try to drive the hill so you hit it in two. If you do that and you push the ball right at all you hit the apartments. If you hit the apartments and break glass you run like hell. Those apartments have always been there since the beginning of the course. They were some of the original housing on the course. I saw Curtis Strange play this hole as an amateur and he drove the bunkers from the back tees. I had a wedge shot for the second shot to the green and he shanked it into the pond next to the green. Pond? Pond. There used to be a pond there. We'll get to that later. Well, actually, as you make a turn, you'll see the green and there's a, there used to be a pond to the right of green now. It's just wasteland, but it was a real pond. That's the green for number two. You see on the right, that swamp used to be a legitimate pond that kind of came a little closer and bent. Not a whole lot's been changed about that. The very front of this green is a dip. And over the years, sometimes they keep it shaved. Sometimes they keep it rough deep. Much harder when they keep it rough deep. so you can't roll it up. My best memory of this hole was playing with my dad. Playing with my dad on a Saturday foursome. We had an eagle, two birdies and a par. Wow. My best memory of this hole is going looking for golf balls at night. Scuba diving, snapping turtles. Urgent here was up there where the road is. Not the interstate, but the road back in the corner a little bit. It was pushed over here about 10 years ago. It may have been longer. We used to have a huge willow tree about where right at the edge there that culvert, the road comes over top that actually would take some balls. Big change on this one, on the right side of the bunker, right side of the green there was a large sand trap there. So if you pushed the ball right you would get into that trap coming off the green. Willow Tree blocked it there. A lot of people pushed it right to that telephone pole. And I believe there was another bunker to the left of the green beyond that. So if you ain't going to get in that one. The green slopes tore us dramatically so the key to this hole has always been to be below the hole on the shots. My favorite memory of this hole is picking fruit from that nice blossoming plum tree up there. That's delicious stuff. Looking back on a number 3t from the number 3 green down to the number 2 green in the distance. We have a bunker at about 170 out on the right on that knoll that takes a lot of shots going to the right. Actually probably kept people out of the creek before. And we all have memories of actually putting the ball on the interstate here with hard slices. And again running like hell when that happened. Yeah, our brother Joe was especially adept at that. He did double lanes I believe. Yep, up by the green you have traps. There's probably one more. Originally there was one in the front right and it was filled in years ago. It's about it on this one. Pretty whole though, don't you think? Gorgeous. Gorgeous whole. The total right side here has been butchered in the last two years. It's all big beautiful trees. Just on the other side of the white stakes all the way up to as far as you can see by that house. You never could see a house before. Originally I think in the 60s those towers weren't there but it's pretty much as far as my memory goes they've always been there. If you hit them you get to play again. No major changes besides that. There was a couple more trees The trees in the rough on the right that kind of died out and they didn't cut them down. And then we go over to hill and there's some changes by the green. But that's it. This is number five green looking back. On the left here there was a bunker right by the golf cart path. Which we catch some balls that really never came into play. There was a tree over here above it that would catch errant shots. Those big pine trees on the right looking back for the longest time were, I remember when they were planted. factor. But it did kind of protect the seventh hole from hearing shots. They didn't change this one too much. It's beautiful green though isn't it? Yeah and they would most treacherous pin placements were in the front of them. Because if you came down it was very difficult to get it to stop. It's just a gorgeous green. Big green too for a countryside. Okay number six has changed tremendously over the years. Used to be a double pond here. Off to the left all those scrub trees are The pond came back toward us about 30 yards. you're in that trap, difficulty out of that trap. On the left hand side of the green, two sand traps. You can see the remnants of them as bunkers now. This was an extraordinarily difficult hole, especially from the blue tees, about 225 yards. Very hard. My very first birdie in my life, I got on this hole. I was playing in the winter. The pond was frozen. I rolled it across the ice onto the green about two feet from the hole and made it to put.","Number one of par four how many yards is this one?

Una consolidación de las políticas públicas en la mayoría de los países latinoamericanos es la razón principal para que la región no se haya visto afectada por los malos momentos financieros que atraviesan Europa y Estados Unidos. En la actualidad, América Latina cuenta con 16.500.000 desempleados, una cifra preocupante pero esperanzadora ya que en este año se han creado más de 600 mil empleos en la región. Cifra que ayudó a que la tasa de desempleo bajara a dos puntos porcentuales en 2012. Es relevante asumir este doble reto, avanzar en los incrementos de la productividad y fortalecer los mecanismos para una distribución de las ganancias correspondientes que estimule la inversión y fortalezca los ingresos de los trabajadores y sus hogares. La CEPAL, en compañía de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo, detallan que los mercados para la entidad económica otro dato alentador tiene que ver con el desempleo urbano, el cual descendió de 7,3% en 2010 a 6,7% en 2011, algo no visto desde 1990. Aunque las cifras son positivas, pues la región ha mostrado avances en los últimos 8 años, aumentando la productividad laboral en 2011. 1,5%. Esos progresos están por debajo de regiones como África y hacia Oriental.","The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the CEPAL, revealed today that the unemployment rate in the region dropped by 6.5% in 2012. A consolidation of public policies in most Latin American countries is the main reason for the region not to be affected by the bad financial moments that Europe and the United States are going through. since in this year more than 600,000 employees have been created in the region. The figure that helped the unemployment rate to drop to 2% in 2012. It is important to assume this double challenge, to advance the productivity increases and strengthen mechanisms for a distribution of the profits corresponding to what stimulates the investment and strengthens the income of workers and their homes. In the end, the economy has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been in the hands of the government, and the government has been 1.5%.

I was sent by the first batch to the base of the lab to participate in the research. It was a fresh start. I started my mission in late-1998. I had three missions in my office. The first one was about the plans for the marine natural resources. This was done by the National Geographic University and the Ocean Museum. The other is about organic natural resources research. This is a collaboration with the University of Zhengqiu. The standard we have received will be in the standard control room in the marine health museum. We also established a gas tank at the low temperature. It is also in the marine health museum. The water level is about 50 cm above the surface. It's dangerous to cause the small body to be in danger. So the whole process is very dangerous. If you don't go to the sea, there's only 20 to 30 minutes of fire. That's dangerous, but we also successfully completed the work. Because it's all ice. That's the last time we got the ocean. This life standard was bigger. It was a difficult time. It was the climate change there. And then the ice melted very quickly. The ice floes from the mountains to the sea. The waves were very big. The waves were all coming up from the bottom. So there was no need to spend too much energy. We easily got these samples. After returning to the marine museum, we studied fish experts. After reading it, we got a question. There is a fish called the roe dragon. It's a kind of fish. It's a kind of fish that we studied. The small shellfish are very important in the ecosystem of the South Pole. They have very important characters. Because the small shellfish are the biological electronic devices we talk about. Many creatures in the South Pole need the biological electronic devices. The production of the raw materials is very important. The two main activities of our marine management this time are the planning of the ocean and the material of the ocean. The other is the direction of the ocean and the pollution of the pollution. The first is that we can communicate with each other in a close relationship. The other aspect is that this time we brought back about 500 samples. We all know that the climate is actually not a pollution source in the South China Sea. But they found those pollution in the air. That means that in Taiwan, some pollution that occurred in such a place, it will flow into a place where there is no air or water, and eventually accumulate in the air. We also found some sea or water-based products, and found some good natural substances. They have a good result for some medicinal products. We also hope that we can We are going to do some deep research in a place like Nanji, including the survey of the environment. So this is what we are currently working on."

That's Probably the main thing we're going to be playing I was planning on starting the series already if you watch my update video You would have known all the different things that we were planning on doing but one of those was Minecraft and we did I'm also going to be putting together the second episode of the Gaming with the Bros series that I'm doing. And my Sony Vegas has been acting up a little bit. That's why I haven't gotten it out sooner and I've only been able to do the campaign for the Black Ops 2. It just, once it gets to a certain point in the video, I don't know if it's just because it was like two hours of footage all in Sony Vegas at once or what, but it was just just cutting out certain parts of the audio or certain parts of the video and I couldn't edit it because I didn't even know what I was watching. If you are an active subscriber, I'd really appreciate it if you could let me know what you want to see in the comments because I have a lot of games and a lot of different things to upload that I think would be good fun and I like doing the walkthroughs and the gameplays of different campaigns in which I don't plan on talking throughout because I'd rather just have it for you guys. I want to know what you guys want to see so I can play with everyone. I've already beaten a single player, but I'd definitely be down for going through that game again. I guess I'll take some time to talk about the gameplay a little bit. This was not too long ago actually. It might have been yesterday. I was playing with my brother. He's DEA7N and his channel will be in the description. He just made a new channel so if you want to check him out you can go there. He'll be doing all types of videos on computers and just running I'm not a fan of random gaming stuff. I think he even plans on creating computers and selling them and just talking about them in general. But I'll let him tell you what he plans on doing. But anyway, I was playing with him here and just playing some hardcore kill confirm. The reason we were playing hardcore, which I don't mind hardcore. Some days I feel like playing it, some days I don't. This gun is the last gun I need to get gold for my SMGs before I have diamond. It definitely lacks in power. It's a better gun if you have the select fire on it. I can also manage it as a burst gun, but it's a lot easier to go through a game and be able to kill them with that first burst instead of going through a core match and having to spray tons and tons of bullets. Some people don't like hardcore because people just camp and sit in corners and just pick you off as you peek out or whatever, but you know, honestly, I play it just as I play the core matches except the main idea with hardcore is first person to shoot the other person generally wins the fight. So you got if you're quick if you're finding that you're shooting a lot of people but then they turn around and shoot you back as soon as I mean you start shooting at them then I would recommend hardcore because I'm like that now I'll start shooting at me get shooting at a guy But maybe it won't kill him right away, and he ends up turning on me somehow and If you're playing hardcore you put that first shot on them. Yo, you'll get them and So that's pretty much my opinion on Hardcore it's pretty fun game type and sometimes if I get stuck having a bad day on a certain game mode I'll switch it up Switch up the game modes maybe it just came out and you you've played like too much straight and then all of a sudden you just start doing really bad and frustrated that's usually how I get after a while. I'll just switch to a completely different game, play that game for a while and you know take a break and then go back because you know just after a while you just get out of the groove and I enjoy playing lots of games so I always make sure I'm mixing my games up and playing different stuff. This video is pretty much wrapping up. I definitely play so I can play a whole variety of games because I'm not looking just to play Call of Duty. So that's pretty much it.

It's not interesting in people to kind of find some other random person to talk to who just happens to be on. So there's something interesting about chat related to terms of visibility to randomly connect you to someone to just throw you into a conversation, this kind of idea of eliminating all approach anxiety. there's no adverse signaling associated with it because you're just thrown into a conversation with someone. You can imagine that moving from a one-to-one medium to a one-to-many medium where over time the more interesting people rise to the top. You start directing more and more traffic automatically using this algorithm towards the people who are more interesting.

Nous, on a un travail très technique, on a un DJ quand on propose, on cherche vraiment des samples, on débarait notre morceau, qu'il y a après avec des musiciens, On met très peu de technicité et après en live, on utilise un peu pour réorchestrer et re-travayer. C'est vrai que c'est assez proche de nous, mais c'est pas entièrement simple. Et puis après dans les groupes, c'est vrai que pour Envega, depuis pas très longtemps, on travaille avec des MC. Mais c'est vrai qu'au départ, on faisait que de la musique instrumentale, c'est-à-dire qu'on prenait des sons dans des films, des poèmes, des choses comme ça. les utiliser comme envoi et après on a fait appel à des M6 et du coup c'est vrai que ça nous a permis de travailler différemment donc c'est un peu difficile de se rendre on a un peu du mal à se classer là dedans mais ce qui est très cohérent pour nous c'est que en gros notre manière de travailler c'est plus comment on va mettre en valeur la base, le naissance et c'est ça qui va créer le lien un peu dans un bon jour On aime beaucoup Chris Taylor aussi, on va beaucoup écouter. Ça nous a surement influencé indirectement. L'évolution de notre musique, je pense qu'on est arrivé à un point où maintenant on maîtrise techniquement la façon de composer. Il n'y a pas un énorme changement dans le fond entre nos premiers morceaux et maintenant, mais on a déjà plus de moyens techniques. On fait plus d'arrangements au plan de vie, on travaille aussi avec des musiciens maintenant dans le DMC. On procéde la même façon, on part de sang, mais là où notre musique évolue, c'est qu'on a maintenant des influences extérières et on s'occupe de collaboration avec des artistes. En fait tout l'aspect visuel de Chinese Man et Chinese Man Records, il est né vraiment avec le projet. Avant de faire de la musique tous les trois, c'est Matteo, Raiku et moi, on était un petit peu dans le milieu artistique, on était sur les écoles, les dessins, son style de musique. Donc on avait beaucoup d'amis autour de nous, on était rétoués, des graphises, des vidéos. et donc cet aspect là on l'a intégré tout de suite puis on aime beaucoup le cinéma et l'influence importante de l'avant des cinéaires donc ça restait assez logique et pour le live c'est notre démarche c'est que la musique électronique sur scène est souvent très statique et ça peut être un peu ennuyeux de voir trois gars derrière l'amplacide donc dès la création du premier spectacle on a essayé de trouver une idée pour en savoir plus vivant et donc la vidéo c'est imposé d'elle même puisqu'on avait des gens très doués autour de nous et puis que ça avec le genre de musique qu'on fait. Il n'y a pas forcément toujours de paroles, toujours de MC par exemple. Donc d'avoir des images qui accompagnent un peu la musique, ça va permettre un univers un peu... Plus qu'un simple concert, on essaie de faire un spectacle, vraiment. Que les gens soient plongés et visuellement et avec la musique dans notre milieu. Pas vraiment conscient, mais la fois qu'on est parti dans ce délire, de la raison où on aimait bien le cinéma asiatique et l'esthétique en général asiatique, qu'on s'est rendu compte qu'effectivement, le haut-tang, Le group IAM qui est en Marseille, c'était sceptique donc c'est quelque chose qui a dû nous marquer un peu tiament et nous prédéter et qui va sortir un petit peu comme ça. On a devenu des amis. Au début on avait pour l'idée de faire remxer deux ou trois titres, pas plus. Et les gens qui nous ont demandé à est-ce que je peux remxer ce morceau-là, est-ce que je peux travailler sur ce morceau-là. Donc à la fin on se retrouve avec tout l'album récié de ce nom de mixer. Et voilà c'est des gens qu'on apprécie maintenant et puis bien sur musicalement. Et je trouve qu'ils ont amené une vraiment une lecture nouvelle. Les prochaines étapes de Chinese Man, la vraie prochaine, on l'a tout le monde juin. On fait la tour des dégoutes, des festivals en France un petit peu. et à part sur l'autor va se reposer, ça fait très longtemps qu'on tourne donc on va plus développer l'aspect label, parce que China is Man Recorder c'est aussi un label et on a un nouveau groupe qui travaille avec nous qui s'appelle Deluxe donc on va vraiment faire attention à eux parce que c'est le début pour eux, ils vont sortir un album et ils vont faire une grosse tournée donc on va surtout avoir ce rôle là mais je pense qu'on va continuer à sortir des maxis, des 2-3 titles, des T-grads 8 pour avoir une petite actualité mais avant le prochain album il va se passer un petit peu de temps Et par extension à tous les gens qui travaillent, on soutiendra le projet. mais je pense que c'est aussi un élément de promo donc on ne s'oppose pas clairement aux gens qui téléchargent chez eux. C'est plutôt bon par rapport à ça parce que plus un élément nous a servi, nous. Ça marche peut-être pas pour tous les artistes mais pour nous en tout cas, elle c'est un truc essentiel. Pour faire de la musique de film, c'est vrai que c'est un truc qui nous intéresse parce qu'on a un petit peu effleuré ça, on n'a pas vraiment essayé. Je pense que la vraie prochaine étape, ça sera Fred & Abel, qui sont nos créateurs vidéo. qui vont sûrement faire une création à un moyen-métrage ou un court-métrage et qui ont le risque de faire la musique pour illustrer leur film d'animation. quelque part notre envie d'indépendance, de ne pas rentrer dans un système de major et tout ça, c'est notre façon à nous de soutenir selon nous, forcément. Mais ça nous interbelle. Après, est-ce que ça va durer quelque chose que je vais toujours savoir ? Mais au moins, ça prouve que les jeunes, ceux qui ont envie de faire quelque chose, ils ne sont pas idiot à regarder la télé, les trucs débiles, on sent qu'il y a une énergie, donc vous vous espérez que ça va plus changer.","It's a bit difficult to approach them. For example, these two are... They have a way of composing the music and playing it live, which is very close. They really work very technically on the sounds they use and produce. And then they reproduce it live. We don't work very technically, we're a DJ when we're composing. We're really looking for samples, to start our song, to play with musicians. We put a lot of technicality and then we use it to re-orchestrate and work on it. It's close to us but it's not entirely simple. And then in the bands, it's true that in the Netherlands, for a long time, we worked with MCs. But at the beginning, we only did instrumental music, that is to say we took sounds, films, poems, things like that. We used them as a voice. And then we called on the M6s. And it allowed us to work differently. So it's a little difficult. We have a little trouble to get into it. But what is very consistent for us is that our way of working is more about how we will put value in a sound. The bass, the bass, the bass. And that's what creates the link a little bit in a sound. We like both Christian and Lars, it's a lot of fun, it has influenced us indirectly. The evolution of our music is really... I think we've reached a point where we're now mastering technically the way we compose. So there's not a huge change in the background between our first songs and now, but we already have more of a technique, we're doing more arrangements at the piano, we're working with musicians, there's a DmC now. So since the first day, We do it in the same way, we do it with blood, but where our music is evolving, we have external influences and we are collaborating with artists. In fact, the visual aspect of Chinese Man and Chinese Man Records, it was born with the project. Before making music every three of us, it was Matteo, Raiko and I, we were in the artistic environment, we were on the schools, the drawings, we had a lot of friends around us, we were treated, graphics, videos, We immediately got involved with this aspect and we like it very much. Cinema has an important influence on the sales of cinema. It was quite logical. For the live show, our approach is that electronic music is often static. It can be a bit boring to see three guys behind a plate. So as soon as the show was created, we tried to find an idea for a more lively performance. The video was imposed by itself because we had people around us. with the kind of music we do. There is no always lyrics, always MCs for example. So having images that accompany music will allow a universe, a little more than a concert, we try to make a show. People will be able to dive and visually and with music in our place. Not really conscious, but once we are part of this delirium, for the reason we like Asian cinema and Asian aesthetics in general, considering that indeed the high-tempo We are going to talk about the group IAB, which is in Marseille, and also this aesthetic, so it's something that has marked us, a little bit, and we will say that we will leave a little bit like that. Icon as a member of the band, because we are distributed, we spend a little bit of the radio but very little, so I think it's hard for people to inform us. So I think remix with the sun, it's really, we started to please each other. All the people who made remixes on this album are people we met in tourney, the majority of them are 8 years old. We started with two or three songs, and people asked us if we could work on this song. At the end, we found ourselves with the album and the song. We appreciate the people who are here and I'm a German musician. They brought us a new reading. The next stages with Chinese Man, the next one, we're here all the way. We're doing the festival tour in France. and apart from that, we're going to rest, it's been a long time since we've been touring so we're going to develop the label aspect because Chinese Man Records is also a label and we have a new group that works with us called DeLux so we're going to really pay attention to them because it's the beginning for them, they're going to release an album and they're going to have a big tour so we're going to have this role but I think we're going to continue to release maxi, two, three titles, free titles so we're going to play a little bit of actuality but before the next album, it's going to be a little bit of time We will be able to see the artist who we like, there is no aesthetic, it can be three. And it's really if it's really three of us, and by extension to all the people who work with us, we will support the project. I think it's also a promo element, so we don't get bored with people leaving the house. It's a lot in relation to that. Because it's a thing that has served us. It doesn't work for all artists, but for me it's essential. To make the music of the film, it's true that it interests us. We have a little bit of that, we haven't really tried it. I think the next stage will be Fred and Annabelle, who are the creators of the video. that will surely create a medium or medium range and we risk making music to illustrate their animation films. All these things interest us, we don't make music for political purposes, there are sometimes some messages, but these messages are more, they are wider than a very specific thing, but as a citizen, it obviously touches us and then it joins the approach of the beauty We have to be independent, not to enter a major system. It's our way of supporting, at least, but it's a bit of a struggle. It's going to be hard to know. But at least it proves that young people are willing to do something. They're not stupid to watch TV, they're stupid to feel like there's energy. So you can expect that it's going to change."

Knowing that people are interested in this means a lot to me,really. The video took me ages to make!!! It'd be great if I came to know that you liked it!! You just can't imagine how much I worked on this. It's probably the best video I've ever made *in my opinion*.  As the title says, it's about Miley Cyrus. My friends probably wonder right now why I didn't choose to make a Jonas Brothers video. Well,I don't have the answer. I just don't know. I guess I was so crazy about Lady Gaga's song, ""Starstruck"" that I thought Miley was perfect for it. And now, if I think again, I can honestly say that the JB don't fit this song. The JB need something fabulous, not just this ""Starstuck""..song.  But wait!!! My next video will definetely be about the Jonas Brothers. I'm still their huge,awesome, incredible fan,don't worry! I just have to find the perfect song for it...I'm still searching! Maybe you can come up with an idea?   I wish I had added more effects,for the video to be better, but I'm not a pro and I'm still learning. The next video will obviously be better.   If you guys like it, I'll do more. Actually,I'll do more no matter if you like it or not. Sony Vegas is like my newest friend right now.  Don't ask me how I made my effects. This can't be explained...  And besides my secret JB dreams, I also dream of becoming a pro in Vegas. And I'll do it..if I have time obviously.  Well,that's it. I think I've written too much. Please don't post mean comments or give it 1 star! Even if you hate Miley Cyrus, me, or my videos.  All the mean comments will definetely be deleted. And don't dare me, because I don't talk crap on people.   So...see ya!!      Software I used: Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9.0  Song: Starstruck by Lady Gaga  Song at the end: 7 things - Miley Cyrus  If you need some extra information, please send me a message! I reply EVERY message I get,really.  Oh,and I don't give out the pics. Unless you're a very good friend of mine.  I'll post my next video soon, so stay tuned for some more great videos!    P.S: Dedicated to my friends who happen to be Miley Cyrus fans: L., A. and I.    -Amy","lady, sony, starstruck, GotMeGoinCrazyJonas, gaga, miley, effects, cyrus, vegas",542,10,5,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/2PL5-YLc8zg.mp3,"Work it back, filter that, baby bump that track Baby bump that track, face cowboy, just play that track Hot guy in the room, so stustard, cherry cherry cherry cherry","Work it back, filter that, baby bump that track Baby bump that track, face cowboy, just play that track Hot guy in the room, so stustard, cherry cherry cherry cherry Stustard, baby bump that track"

Noi non viviamo e non vivremo tempi ordinari. Il governo dell'Unione ha lasciato una traccia profonda nella memoria degli italiani, ma adesso c'è il PD e dobbiamo saper mostrare che l'Italia potrà contare su un governo e una maggioranza stabili e coesi. Ci sono dunque impegni che proporremo di sottoscrivere. Ad esempio quello di affidare alla responsabilità del candidato premio, una composizione del governo snella rinnovata, competente e credibile internazionalmente, quello di consentire una cessione di sovranità e cioè di sciogliere controversi e su atti rilevanti attraverso votazioni a maggioranza dei gruppi parlamentari in seduta congiunta. quello di rispettare gli obblighi internazionali che valgono sempre finché non si modificano quello di sostenere l'azione del governo per la difesa della moneta unica e per la costruzione europea quello di avanzare una proposta comune verso tutte le forze democratice europeiste disposte a contrastare la deriva berlusconiana e leghista e ogni forma di regressione populista quello in fine di mostrare nel campo progressista una civiltà di rapporti che renda davvero credibile agli occhi degli italiani la promessa di governabilità. Voglio dirlo subito, non tutti questi elementi li vedo acquisiti, ma io propongo di tenerli molto ma molto fermi. Ecco, attorno a questi fondamentali elementi chiedo l'Assemblea di Mandato a promuovere una discussione larghe aperta nel partito con i protagonisti politici, sociali e civili del campo progressista. e sulla base di questo confronto è nostra intenzione di terminare un grande appuntamento di partecipazione per la scelta del candidato dei progressisti alla guida del governo. Le primarie non le faremo da soli e dunque i tempi immodi non li possiamo decidere da soli. Lasciate me lo dire con chiarezza, non si parlerà del PD, non sarà il Congresso del PD, si parlerà di Italia e del governo del Paese. tuttavia, detto questo, possiamo certamente dire quali criteri proporranno al PD per delle primarie da tenersi come logico in una ragionevole distanza delle elezioni, cioè entro alla fine dell'anno. A questo proposito, proposto dei criteri, dalla direzione è venuto un criterio di apertura, un criterio che suggerisce Tuttavia, detto questo, tuttto questo, possiamo certamente, tuttavie, tuttavie, ditto questo, possiamo certamente, tuttavie, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, d di questo criterio, che corrisponde all'idea di investire anche rischiando qualcosa, me ne rendo conto, ma di investire sul rapporto fra politica e società che oggi è largamente in crisi. È in nome di questa stessa logica, mentre ho ritenuto giusto dichiarare da subito la mia candidatura, la candidatura del segretario del Partito Democratico, anche in un sequiro, le nostre regole. Ho chiesto e chiedo tuttavia che questa non sia in via di principio una candidatura esclusiva. e quindi avremo modo, nel tempo giusto, subito dopo la riprese, di investire l'Assemblea dei temi regolamentari e statutari e di prendere assieme le decisioni conseguenti.","We will all ask the progressives to think about their responsibility and their reliability. We will not live and we will not live ordinary times. The Union Government has left a deep mark in the memory of the Italians. But now there is the PD and we must know to show that Italy can count on a government and a stable and cohesive majority. and the commitments we will propose to underwrite. For example, to entrust the responsibility of the Prime Minister, a composition of the government, a renewed, competent and credible international. To allow an accession of sovereignty, and to dissolve controversies and relevant acts through the majority of parliamentary groups in the joint settlement. to respect international obligations that are always worth until they are changed. To support the government's action for the defense of the unique currency and for European construction. To advance a common proposal towards all European democratic forces willing to contrast the deriving of the Berlusconian and the Legista and any form of populist regression. To finally show the progressive field a civil relationship that truly makes the eyes of Italians credible, the promise of governability. I want to say it immediately, not all of these elements I see them acquired, but I propose to keep them very, very firm. Here, around these fundamental elements, I ask the Assembly to promote a large and open discussion in the party with the political, social and civil leaders of the progressive field. And on the basis of this confrontation, it is our intention to finish a great appointment of participation for the choice of the candidate of the progressives to the government. The primaries will not do it alone, and therefore the times in which we cannot decide them alone. Let me say it clearly, it will not be spoken of the PD, it will not be the PD Congress, it will be spoken of Italy and the government of the country. However, However, we can certainly say what criteria the PD will propose for the primaries to keep themselves as logical in a reasonable distance from the elections, that is, at the end of the year. This proposal, the proposal of criteria, from the direction, has come a criteria of openness, a criteria that suggests that the width of participation is privileged rather than the length of barriers. They are personally very convinced. of this criterion, which corresponds to the idea of ​​investing, even risking something, I realize it, but of investing in a relationship between politics and society that is largely in crisis today. It is in the name of this same logic, while I have just thought of declaring immediately my candidature, the candidature of the Secretary of the Democratic Party, even if it does not follow our rules. I have asked and I ask however, that this is not, in the first place, an exclusive candidature. and therefore we will, in the right time, immediately after the reprise, invest in the assembly of the regulatory and statutory issues and take the decisions together."

Christie is owned by Lee Gregory of Boston, Massachusetts. He's being written today by Kate Aldeford. In 2009, Christie won the coveted Captain Mark Phillips Award and the American Eventing Championships. It is awarded to the leading pony in the beginner novice division which is written by a junior. The Dunn Yelling is Stony Brook Belmont. Monty is written by his owner Lee Webster. They have come all the way from California. Monty is shown in Dressage eventing, jumping and also fox hunts for fun. Also returning to the arena is Ben Marbella Blue with FBI Dressage Rider Leslie McKeonborn showing the versatility of the breed going from driving to under saddle. A little more about the breed standard, Connemaras in North America range from 13 to over 15 hands. The predominant colors are gray, beige, brown and done with some roms and an occasional black, chestnut or palomino. A Connemara pony is rugged and sturdy with a compact body, broad chest, well-sprung rib cage and good depth for the heartburn. Their action is straight and true both front and rear with free movement in the shoulders. The head is well-shaped and balanced in proportion to the rest of the body with the neck of good length and definition, meeting the shoulders smoothly.

How do you see this? The A short comment from the US President, how did you see the US meeting? If you call again then you will get the code of 051. If you want to call again then you will get the code of 051. The government of the country is not going to be able to do anything about it. The Prime Minister said that he and I are the people of the Jamaat. They are not being derailed. They have a lot of focus. Is there any more benefit for the future politics? The politics of the Mufti are very valuable. First of all, we have to admit that our political community is absolutely neutral. The reason for the politics of the Mufti is that it is the value of the people of Pakistan. This time, if we talk about the need of the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the state, or the minister of the The government cannot stay in the same place. They cannot rely on this. Because the RGST, the response given by the Mullah Fazur Rahman, the MQM, etc. There can be many such cases. I think I should share something with you. The circumstances that I am seeing, the needs of the MIA are more than the needs of the Ghilani. And the needs of the MIA are also important. If you follow the same process, when the government adopted the same approach, they were still in opposition, and then MQMI came, and the government was going to the government. They were also very focused. The boldly, the bravely, the MIA came in front and they did not participate in the protest, and they were very eager to participate. and the government is the only one who is left with the favor. So all those people who left the country and some people came back, some people came back. Because the door is open, they think it is not better. In the previous door, the old Zangalooda Tala was opened and they are trying to enter. And I think some people are inside, who are sitting in the government, they are trying to open the Zangalooda Tala. and the oil will be drained so that the lock opens. But if the lock is a little soft, then some people will get the alfie. Now I think who got the alfie so that the back door cannot be opened. It has happened that it is now working outside. Then the ten points that came after that. According to me, these ten points are also underground. The quick and precise manner of the talks, if you look at the political situation, you will see that the hard-liner, the block-talking, the un-sensitive manner, but you have to come out and say that the party is a juggler, no one has any problem, but the people who are close to the President, like Babar Awan, the way you see the past, I am Saeed Kazmi, or you can see many things in the text. You will see that at this time the Prime Minister is in action. Most of the cases are about the power of the text and the influence of the text. If you listen to the conversation that you had just made, you will see that the Prime Minister is in action."

Thanks to the magic slash board line witchcraft of the pick 10 system in the game, what I've done is created a pistol only class. So I'm running around with the starting pistol, the 5-7, reason for that will be coming up later. I've got long barrel and laser sight on there, I've got ghosts, scavenger, dead silence and engineer on, and finally I'm running around with one solitary flashbang. Now at this point I can imagine a lot of people in the corner duty in quote community going absolutely bananas upon watching this video you know it's like why are you only using a pistol why are you not using a primary well questioners of my logic I'm actually gonna go on now to say I'm still level 55 and I'm not yet prestigeed now before people start freaking out yes I'm aware once you prestige you don't lose all the progress towards camos and headshots you've done on the weapon okay you keep all that all your weapons just get relocked and yes I'm also aware of the fact that the starting pistol is the starting pistol. You know, it's not going to go anywhere once I'm prestige because it's going to be there from the very beginning. It's not like if you create a class from level 55 and then you have to go back all the way to the top of the mountain in order to make that same class again. So there can only be one answer to the mystery behind why I'm using such a ridiculous class at the moment and why I've not prestigeed. It's gold baby! Solid gold! Well, it's kind of 70-30 gold but there are other reasons which I'll get to in a bit but yeah, it's pretty much gold. Now what it is, I've got the 870 up to gold absolutely stunning in gold and I've got the MK48 in gold which looks ridiculous you know big heavy machine gun it's all sparkle sparkle yeah I'm big pimping on the battlefield apparently but you know I thought you might as well challenge yourself and do something that's gonna be a bit harder shotgun is absolutely the easy to do once you made the right class MK48 hold down trigger nom nom nom everyone falls over but a pistol on the other hand a pistol is quite tricky to do as you can see I do go on some quite nice streaks and also get away from quite naughty things while using the pistol and it's all down to the class I've made. But normally I wouldn't give the pistol a second thought. You know, I think a lot of people getting to this mentality is that Prime Re's the only weapon I've got, so it's that or a knife or run away. But actually perking out the pistol and running with it made me realise just what a beast it is, to be honest. So I think I'm on the last 40 or 35 headshots I need before I unlock the Typhoon Camo and then I've got to do the extra challenges like running around with no perks on, running around with no attachments on the weapon and you know, get all that done, get a gold camo and it's another one to the mix and then I can focus on the next prestige on the assault rifles and the sniper rifles. Oh boy the first sniper rifle, joy of joys. Now this might seem very very weird because I said earlier in the video that all your stats carry over so why do it now, you can do it later. But this is the underlying factor behind getting gold now. If I get gold now, it's done and dusted. But I know for a fact when Cypress-Tige, if I was trying to backtrack I would not contemplate it because I'd be with those higher tier weapons and you know, be quite comfortable there, there's no point going back using a lesser, inferior weapon when you've got this absolute beast of a cannon stuck to your hands. If you think about it as well, the game's still in its feeling out process, so there's a lot of inexperienced players on there. Now I don't want to say I take advantage of the noobs' scrubs, but I do smack them senseless. So you know, now's a better time than any for me to whip out my pistol and get those kills I need before I prestige and before everyone suddenly gets good at the game. It's still early days for me as well, going on from the previous point, so you know I'm trying to figure out how the weapons work. I say how the weapons work I pull trigger and people fall over in reality I pull trigger and then shout and claim like switch but We all do it don't deny it But yeah, this first prestige I can just use get to grips with weapons and then I can progress on use higher tier weapons because all the fun react differently But I'd rather learn the basics now as opposed to doing it later above all else though It's the immense feeling of satisfaction when you pick off a sniper at long range with a little pistol, you know, they're sadly going they can't see me pew pew pew they fall over. What is this madness! Must write to Treyarch pistols need nerfing! it's like you know what stuff it too much effort I'm happy with blue tiger but now it's like no I want my gold camo so if you're going for gold with any weapon at the moment leave it in the comments below it'd be quite interesting to see how the battlefield is shaping up which way people are generally going and yeah that's pretty much it for the video thanks for watching everybody I hope you enjoyed the gameplay in the commentary don't forget to rate comment and subscribe keep up the GGs and I will see you in the next video take care of yourselves","What's up everybody, happy Friday, VB here bringing you a few highlights from my pistol lalalala class on Black Ops 2.

What is this madness? Must write to Treyarch, pistols need nerfing! So other than that whole being a boss thing, the other reason I'm running a pistol is just because it's a challenge. I think there comes a point with any first person shooter online, it gets very complacent, everyone gets into the same old daily grind of using the same weapon, same class over and over again. But I'd rather, you know, give myself a challenge and there's nothing more challenging than going for gold and this actually seeming doable, you know, before when they'd done gold camo it's like you know what stuff it too much effort I'm happy with blue tiger but now it's like no I want my gold camo so if you're going for gold with any weapon at the moment leave it in the comments below it'd be quite interesting to see how the battlefield is shaping up which way people are generally going and yeah that's pretty much it for the video thanks for watching everybody I hope you enjoyed the gameplay in the commentary don't forget to rate comment and subscribe keep up the GGs and I will see you in the next video take care of yourselves"

Most of the women I knew so far are very good at it. I always saw women like that, but I always fell in love with the way they wear gloves. I'll show you a lot of free exercise, not a boss.

Caso conté de honestos, simpáticos, nos nofomantes, teria uma fila de pretendência batendo sua porta. O amor não é chegado a fazer contas, não obedece a razão. O verdadeiro amor acontece por empatia, por magnetismo, por conjunção estelar. Ninguém ama outra pessoa porque ela é educada, veste-se bem ou é fã de Caetano. Isso são só referências. pela paz que o outro lhe dá, ou pelo tormento que a própria vóca faz. É uma serpontão de voz, pela maneira que os olhos piscam, pela praogilidade que se revela quando menos se espera. Você ama aquela petulante. Você escreveu dúzias de cartas que ela não respondeu. Você deu flores que ela deixou acerco. Você gosta de rock, ela gosta de escolhinho. Você gosta de praia, ela tem alergia a sol. Você abomina o natal e ela detesta um novo. Nem no ódio vocês combinam. Então, ela tem um jeito de sorrir que o deixe mobilizado, o beijo dela é viciante, muito mais viciante do que um LSD. Você adora brigar com ela e ela adora implicar com você. Isso tem nome. Se ama aquele cafajeste. Ele disse que vai ligar e não liga. Ele veste primeiro o trap, que encontra no armário e não implaca uma semana nos empregos. Está sempre duro. Emigalinha, ele não tem a menor vacação para a príncipe encantado, mas ainda assim você não consegue despachá-lo. Quando a mão dele toca a sua nuca, se derrete feito manteiga, ele toca gaita de boca, adora animais e escreve poemas. Mas por que você ama esse cara? Não pergunte pra mim, você é inteligente. Se lê livro, jornais e vistas, mostra de fim os irmãos poemas sabe que uma boa comédia romântica, também tem seu valor. É bonito. Você está vindo nasceu para se sacudir do comercial de shampoo. E seu corpo tem todas as curvas no lugar. Independente, emprego fixo, moçaldo no banco, gosta de viajar, de música, tem loucura no computador. E seu fetutinho de pesuntos é imbatível. Você tem bom ou bom? Não pega, não pede ninguém e adora, simplesmente adora sexo. Com o currículo desse criatura, como é que você ainda está Não é assim um amor. Ah, um amor. Essa raposa. Quem deram amor não fosse um sentimento, mas uma equação matemática. Imagina, é o linda, você é inteligente, dois apaixonados. Ou não fosse um assim. Um amar não requer conhecimento prévio nem consulta no SPC, nada disso. Não, mas sei justamente pelo que o amor tem de indefinível. Honestos. Existem os milhares. Generosos. Tem as pencas.

If they had honest, friendly, and new-born people, they would have a line of pretentiousness beating their door. Love is not enough to make you realize it's not because of that reason. True love happens because of empathy, magnetism, and star conjunction. No one loves another person because they are educated, they know each other well or they are Caetano fans. These are just references. Love for the smell, the mystery, by the peace that others give you or by the torment that comes back. Everything does. It is a voice-tongue, by the way the eyes blink, by the fragility that reveals itself when you least expect it. You love that petulant. You wrote dozens of letters that she did not answer. You gave flowers that she left dry. You like rock, she likes little school. You like beach, she has sun allergy. You abominate Christmas and she detests again. Not even in the audio you combine. So, she has a way of smiling. That the deejay is mobilized. Her kiss is a Vicente. Much more Vicente than a DSD. You love to fight with her and she loves to implicate you. That has a name. Seama, that cafajeste. He says he will call and he does not call. He wears the first suit, who finds a closet. And does not pay a week in the jobs. It's always hard. Remiga Alinha, he doesn't have the best vacation for Prince Encantado, but still you can't get rid of him. When his hand touches your neck, you melt made of butter, he touches mouth gaita, loves animals and writes poems. But why do you love this guy? Don't ask me, you're always smart. You read books, newspapers, magazines, show movies, brothers and sisters with poems, but you know that in a good romantic comedy, you have your value. It's beautiful. You were born to be a salesman in a shopping mall, in a pub. And your body has all the curves in place. Independent, fixed job, a good salary in the bank. I like to travel, music, have a good time on the computer. And your little fat fetish, it's unbeatable. You have a good mood. Don't get it, don't get it, nobody loves it. Simply loves sex. With the curriculum of this creature, how is it still Love without a love. Love without a love. This rap. Who gives a love is not a feeling, but a mathematical equation. Imagine. It's beautiful, you're intelligent, two lovers. It can't be like that. Love doesn't require prior knowledge or a consultancy in the SPC, nothing of that. But it's precisely because love has indefiniable. Honest. There are thousands. Generous. There are the penises. Many good tourists, good family, it's like that, but no one can be like that, what a love of your life."

Just wanted to shoot a quick video here to talk about something that's very, very important in the mortgage approval process. And that's your credit score maintaining its current credit worthiness right through to the end of the transaction. So what does that mean? Well, when you apply for a mortgage and you get a pre-approval, or if you're applying for a mortgage and you've got a real deal on the go like you've made an offer on a home, your credit score and a basically a snapshot of your credit situation at that current time. Now, if you're gonna be purchasing within the next 30, 60, 90 days, maybe in 120 days, the lender is going to want to know that you're gonna maintain the exact same or relatively close credit score and credit worthiness up until the point of closing. Now, where this can get really sticky is if after you've gotten your pre-approval and you've been approved for the loan and then you You know you firm up your agreement on your purchase a couple of couple months passed by and then the next thing you know you're gonna be moving in the home and ready to close but you decide to go out and purchase a large item something like a car loan every single month coming out of your account that could really jeopardize the purchase and the closing of your mortgage why? That's because you're adding another monthly obligation another debt to your credit bureau and what lenders might do is and they've been doing this more recently more than the years past is doing a credit check before closing to ensure that your credit score is A, the same and B, that you haven't tacked on any more debts that might jeopardize you paying the mortgage. So just be weary and proceed with caution as you approach the closing day that you're not taking on any new loans, any new balances and kind of resist the urge to seek more credit because that could deteriorate your credit score getting closer to closing. as we're in the spring market and everybody's thinking about maybe moving and buying, just keep that in mind.

I have to say though it was basically a life-changing experience. I cannot remember a point in my life where I have spent a week with revolutionaries and the fact that I work in the tax office, the fact that I am a revolutionary and the fact that I am trying to be part of a campaign within the HMRC though I did try and get a strike action going over our office closures and there is a battle just in terms of the confidence, are the members that are confident to go out, can we get the action right now, is the moods right? And here I am, sitting in front of a man, Kamal Abu A'ayite, who's 58 years old, who's been in prison 18 times, and who's basically a lifelong political activist, and when he speaks, he speaks though I with a passion of someone who's just tasted victory for the first time. He did try and get a proper job after he left university but he couldn't get one so he ended up in a tax office. And that's basically how he ended up creating one of the mass strikes that basically was part of the Egyptian Revolution. I'll try and give a quick broad brush about what happened. They did have an official trade union in the tax office but in 1974 The tax government closed them down because the property tax collectors, they tried to collect the taxes off the mother of the Ministry of Finance. So basically, Sardat introduced the law to shut them down. So instead of them being employed by central government, they ended up being employed by the councils. So over the next 25 years, because they became employees of the local councils, their wages went down, their terms and conditions went down, these were a hated group of workers. because they weren't collecting taxes off the rich, they were collecting taxes off the poor, i.e. though when you're a property tax collector in Egypt you go round to people's houses, you collect the money in cash, you therefore are going to get beaten up or you're going to get attacked and it's the same thing that was happening when they were trying to collect the taxes off peasants. So you've got a very oppressed bunch of workers, so basically in 2006 the government decided they were going to take away one means of payment that the tax and Kamal who had been, he had set up this independent trade union informally. He was the president, he had basically lost his position because Mubarak had then closed down that union. In 2006, no sorry, in 2007 they got this payment taken off him. So Mubarak, now a grassroots activist, he decides he doesn't like this, he contacts some of his friends in the provinces. He says, come on, well love pays as it is. We cannot afford to lose any more of this. a and and these individuals, the 40, 50 years old though, as I say, the tax collectors, they've never been involved in anything like this before in their life. But men and women are coming together, Muslim women, the first time they were being out on strike like this, long as they had Muslim men, first time tax collectors being out on strike. So many ways though, that strike was phenomenal. So the end ups, sitting there for 11 days, they tried to get security, tried to move them on, day seven, they were told by the men, Minister of Security, people are sick here, just go out of the square because by now it was national news. When the local community heard what he said, they brought even more food. We love you, we respect you, we want this strike to continue. So on day 11 in front of the media, Cabal and his negotiators met with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Finance said to them, okay, you can have your pay rise, you can have 341% pay rise. I wish I had asked Kamal what was the mood like at that moment when you told those strikers about that because if you have lived under the regime of Mubarak all of your life you will not have been able to publicly voice your opinion you'll only have ever been able to grumble in private and deliberate feeling that that must have been to basically within that short period to win that money but basically you had to take on and defeat one of the most repressive dictators in the world. I just cannot imagine what that must have been like at that time. Now what Kamal says is he argues though, this was the precursor to the Egyptian revolution itself. They'd seen the success of the tax workers, they'd seen how they were able to win with that sitting. So basically that then became the inspiration for the revolution within Tahrir Square itself. Rosa Luxembourg talks about it, she talks about the phenomenon of the the mass strike, how the working class is an intelligent class, it lends off each other, basically though I start copying successful tactics that have been used before. And to be honest with you though, we've seen that in Egypt in 2011. And to be honest with you, I think that is the country to watch now. If you basically believe in revolution, if you want to overthrow the state, then the fact that they are actually living out that revolution now, as Umjum said, they are going through the arguments, they are having the internal battles. The political ideology is just, it's everywhere right now but it's a fascinating country to go to. I really recommend every one of you go over there."

On fait des installations multimédia. Je suis danseur au départ, puis plasticien et puis tobelien. Je travaille aussi la programmation et la vidéo. Je commence à faire de la photo, après je me suis lancé dans la vidéo, des installations, ça fait une dizaine d'années qu'on travaille ensemble. Nous présentons donc une installation panoramique donc vidéo et son en 3D en anaglif avec une nette rouge et bleue qui relate un simulacre d'expérience sur le langage. Le spectateur est au centre d'une expérience. Il ne sait pas si c'est lui le sujet de l'expérience ou si c'est nous. Il est observé de toutes parts et il se pose la question de pourquoi. Mais il n'y a pas de réponse. Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse imaginer au si loin. Moi personnellement. Et notre création, en tout cas si on continue à travailler ensemble, on aura toujours une forme très similaire à ce qui est présenté là. L'art est censé ne pas avoir de règles ou à les dépasser donc c'est dur de voir très loin. déjà très vieux, ça je me trompe pas et plutôt dans l'écriture je pense, quelque chose de plus cérébréal et plus immédiable. Je dirais moi tridimensionnel. Ben 2050 c'est demain, on ne le verra pas arriver, c'est ça le problème.","My name is Thierry Mathieu, I'm a member of the Yo-Yo team, and I'm a dancer at the beginning, then a plastician, then a comedian, then I also work on programming and video. My name is Jean-François Denis Philippot, I'm a member of the Yo-Yo team. I'm going to start taking pictures, then I'll start making videos, and then I'll start making installations. It's been a decade since we've worked together. We're going to introduce a panoramic installation, so videos and sounds, 3D in an angle, with a blue red net, which relates to a simulation of experiences on language. The spectator is in the center of an experience. He doesn't know if it's him or us, he's observed everywhere. He wonders why, but there's no answer. I don't think we can imagine it so far. Personally. And our creation, if we keep working together, we'll always have a similar shape to what's presented here. The art is supposed to not have rules or to go beyond them, so it's hard to see very far. I would just be very panicked in its creation, it seems to me the only word that comes to mind is to be at ease and happy to be able to offer things to the public. Everything we create is ways to express things, very hard to express things, so I imagine rather being I'm not wrong, it's already very old, and rather in writing, I think. Something more cerebral and more immediate. I would say 3D. Well, 2050 is tomorrow. We won't see it happen, that's the problem."

Then grandma goes to sleep. She is angry, angry, but now she has to be in the snow. And at what age does it have to be a man to tell him about his old age? I think...

I started writing this blog at the start of my some holidays. I've become increasingly aware that my younger students aged 11 to 13 were reaching for the calculators the easiest question. I'm a teacher and a parent and an aiming at this message to parents not just teachers. Basic mental arithmetic skill is not being sufficiently developed in young children. That quick calculation done in the head is not being made. So I can easily remove the calculators, but how do we develop a mental arithmetic ability? When I was at school, we were made to sing the timetables every morning, but I don't think I can inflict that on anyone today. Do the words long division or fractions send a shiver down your spine. Why is that? There's nothing mysterious in how we manipulate numbers. Our young children should be developing a mental agility with them. So I'm looking for something stimulating, engaging, that's going to develop a child's mental arithmetic skill. Something which will help with recall of basic facts and develop calculation strategy.

There is a wealth of resources out there we can tap into. Some are very amateurish, some are professional, some are free and some are expensive. I believe that you pay for what you get, but I am quite prepared to pay for the right thing. So please check out my blog www.mathfungames.org and see what I'm coming up with.

More than 5 million people in over 60 countries have directly or indirectly profited from fairer ties between producer and consumer. It's a simple idea: Consumers pay a bit more to benefit farmers and producers in less developed countries. Even more exotic products, such as purple rice from Laos, are being sold as fair trade items. But improving the living standard of fair trade rice farmers in Laos is a slow process - since growing crops using chemical fertilizers and pesticides is more profitable. Instead of planting fair trade rice, many farmers have opted to grow maize for Vietnamese clients. Meanwhile, activists are still pushing the fair trade concept, and a portion of the revenue from fair trade products helps fund local infrastructure.","Laos, purple rice, DW-TV, exotic, Germany, World Issues, Global 3000, product, Information, fair trade, Deutsche Welle, Economics, Culture, Deutschland",3667,17,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/5Zg0-6uvS6g.mp3,"This very special purple rice begins its long journey in northern Laos.

I started to earn a little more and that improved life for my family a bit. But fair trade should benefit the environment and the village as well. But recently, fair trade rice in Kasi has been facing more obstacles. Sissel Yao Sveng-Suk-Sah, who leads a Laoshan Fair Trade Association, is visiting the region. Bunmi Salikiao shows him some of the local fair trade projects. There ought to be an irrigation dam here. The idea was to use the existing rice fields more efficiently to stop farmers clearing forest for new fields. The dam was much too small for the needs of our farmers here. We used it for a while, but now it's falling apart. Many villagers in Kasi think they've profited too little from fair trade in purple rice. Bounmi Salikiao is among those who says the sales figures are still too low. So more and more farmers are doing other sorts of business. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are in demand as never before. A neighbouring farmer, Lueng, has decided to try them out. Although most fair trade producers reject their use. Instead of fair trade rice, he's now growing maize for businesses from Vietnam. Neighboring China and Vietnam have been currying favour with the farmers here for several years because there's still quite a lot of land available in Laos, land that could provide profitable yields.

I think it's a farmer's daily life that preoccupies them. They need money now, not in the distant future. But I still hope that we can make fair trade more commercially viable, and then they'll show more interest. The purple rice is processed in the Laotian capital, Viennchan, That provides jobs for about 50 women. They separate the good rice grains from those that can't be used. It's not an exciting job, but for many it's a good opportunity to earn money. Most of the other produce, like the maize, leaves the country unprocessed. This worker says she earned the equivalent of about 70 euros a month. That's slightly more than an average worker's wage in Laos. So as a promoter of fair trade, Cicelyao Svengsuxa constantly tries to new markets and cultivation areas for purple rice. He thinks fair trade still has great potential in Laos. We can't compete with our neighbors Vietnam and Thailand in quantity and price because they have better infrastructure and they have seaports. So we're concentrating on fair trade and quality. The last steps before the rice leaves the country From every kilo of rice sold, five cents go to social projects like the school in Kasi. The finished mixture contains 20% purple rice and 80% ordinary white rice. After travelling 9,000 kilometres, the rice reaches its destination, a fair trade shop in Germany. Neither the sales staff nor the customers here know about the difficulties involved in cultivating and producing it in Laos. People are excited to find purple rice because it's unusual. But we want to sell quality above all. Customers should buy it because it's good and then because it's reasonably priced. And they're supporting fair trade.

Thank God for His word. Hallelujah. What is important? His word, fruit also. I understand that this is something that the Lord has told us, it is important, it is something that the Lord has important to us, we must be aware of it. And we have God, trust in the Lord God, as he shared the word. There are many things to do to take the role of the God of God. Not to reject with your help, you know that what is not good and we also have the most possible, you know, it has been limited by the Lord and we are limited by His word, we are not allowed to die, with the bread that came, you know, you have a complete sacrifice, in Him we are complete, you know, we have contentment, it is His word. Thank you, sir. It's beautiful. Well, the people who are behind us, please, let's give them a hand. And we are all in the possession of a felicitator, a brother of the Church, who has told me that I am very rich. Please, let's invite you to come here and cheer everyone up. If I had a little punishment, I would say that one of the people who did not have a dear affection I didn't go there, I didn't go there myself, I didn't go there until I met Jesus Christ. I was born in our town when I was 10 years old because my mother was put in the gulland of 200 years old. That was the only thing I knew. I was born in a year when I was 10 years old. I was 100 years old, I was 100 years old, I was all crazy. I went to the basement and they told me, God, God, I didn't know anything about it. What I thought was that if I stayed like this forever, with the anguish that was already changing and knowing that I wasn't and taking the right reality would have been tremendous. From there I went to the hospital, I spent many months there, taking drugs and doing double interviews. There people in the Río Sublisto have taught me how to do it, so help me. The place was full of russians, I mean, well, the Río Sublisto was there, they had had programs with drugs, with the presidium, with the constitution and many other things. So I said, well, those people, if the noise doesn't sound right, and I said to myself, God, if you insist on showing me that you are alive, help me. And at the beginning I said, well, it is a case of God's mercy, that we begin to do more than the same thing, that we do more than the broken ones, and we begin to do things right, and in the end with the blessing of God, we are doing things in life. And well, I give the truth to God that he has given me. Until that time my life had no sense. It was as if I had tried to have something with my hands open and I had not felt anything until I was 21 years old. Today I give you my thanks to God for this and for my life. Who is it? There is only one person. You are creating everything that loves me, for the glory of God. Thank you very much, I will make families, I will go to the church, it will be worth it, if you have seen it, it will be worth loving, it will be worth fighting for the less of the faithful. Amen!"

Yo creo que deberemos de ser muy claros. Nosotros hemos estado denunciando a estos tipos que no son de son perredistas. Es un grupo apoyado, auspiciado, mandado, protegido, además de las propias autoridades. Concretamente de Mario Marín y de Javier López Sabada. Él es el que les paga, él es el que les ordene y es el que le dice que tiene que hacer. No nos hagamos tontos. Sabemos perfectamente bien que nosotros hemos presentado toda una serie de denuncias y de quejas ante las instancias y las autoridades correspondientes y no han hecho absolutamente nada en relación a esta campaña.

A mí, Marín, desde hace seis años, cuando él iba a ser candidato, me dijo, nada de alianzas, nada de alianzas. En aquel entonces, no hubo alianzas, no se dieron simplemente nada más con algún otro partido como Convergencia. Pero ahora, cuando las cosas ya son diferentes, cuando estamos en una coalición donde participa el pan, pues claro que ya ven peligro de irse y ven volando sus privilegios de los cuales han estado gozando durante mucho tiempo. no es raro que bueno lo hemos denunciado ahí están que dijeron los medios absolutamente nada de lo que nosotros dijimos el lunes sobre los 208 mil millones de pesos que ha ejercido este gobierno del estado pues eso es lo que les duele ya no poder ejercer ya no tener el poder ya no tener el control y ocupan a este tipo de tipos sí que los otros los conocemos que ni siquiera perredistas son oye pregúntales pregúntales nada más a dos a tres de ellos sí a qué facultad van que es que nosotros hemos llevado a cabo una política de altura, una política de propuestas, en donde nosotros las vamos a llevar a cabo. Es una política más que nada de un compromiso con la propia ciudadanía y nosotros no vamos a caer en este tipo de provocaciones. analizar los videos de toda esta trifulca. que no nos dejen solos el próximo 4 de julio. es una mezquindad de parte de él, me parece que no debería estar utilizando a la gente como carne de cañón. Nervios, focos rojos encendidos en el PRI, es evidente que él, así como los supuestos militantes que han estado renunciando al PAN, él es un infiltrado del gobierno estatal en el PRD y por eso este tipo de acciones para desestabilizar la coalición. Sí, sin duda, sí, sin duda, los mismos perredistas te pueden dar fe de que es un infiltrado de gobernación en las filas del PRD.","For her part, the State Department of National Action Administration Director, Juan Carlos Mondragon and the Aspiranta Regidor of the community, Arturo Loyola, are the leaders of the State Government. They said that Armando Mendes is a government-based government official, a member of the State, and he is being infiltrated by the PRD by orders of Mario Marin Torres. This type of campaign, I don't think they get it out of anonymous alcohol or the quotas that ask for recovery. We know perfectly well who he is, we know who he is and the serious thing is that he is exposed by all the authorities. He has been a situation that hurts him. From the beginning when we think about it, the possibility of going to a coalition with other political parties from that moment on. I'm going to say it to you in an exclusive way. I've been a candidate for Marine since I was 6 years old. He said, nothing about alliances. Nothing about alliances. At that time there were no alliances. They just gave us nothing more.

The one who doesn't want to, the one who doesn't want to, doesn't realize it, or doesn't want to realize it, or as our candidate Rafael Moreno says, there is time for us to open our eyes. We are not going to act, because we are going to be We have carried out a policy of height, a policy of proposals where we are going to carry them out. It is a policy of a commitment with the citizenship itself and we are not going to take these kinds of provocations. Juan Carlos Mondragon assured that this will be analyzed to determine if a criminal complaint is presented against who is responsible, since it will be to analyze the videos of all this trifleca. We ask people to be very analytical and to not leave us alone until July 4th. I don't know the elements to say that my colleagues will analyze it in a while. But what we do know is that Armando uses the people of the annex that have the high level of rehabilitation of anonymous alcohol to do these provocations. I think that he should not be using people as a cannon fodder. Red-fired nerves on the PRI is evident that he, just like the supposed militants who have been renouncing the PAN, he is a infiltrator of the state government in the PRD and that is why this type of action is to destabilize the coalition. Yes, without a doubt, the same PRDs can give you faith that it is a government infiltration in the PRD lines."

Me dirijo nuevamente a ustedes para continuar siguiendo las indicaciones de nuestro secretario general, quien me ha instruido que les informe respecto a las distintas temáticas que dentro del área de seguridad social tenemos. Una de ellas se refiere a las licencias de gravidés. Como ustedes saben, las licencias de gravidés son concedidas por tres meses, por 90 días continuos o por un mes antes y dos después del parto. Hemos encontrado últimamente que en muchas de nuestras compañeras el parto se les adelanta y al tener, al darles la primera alciencia en 30 días se les corta e inmediatamente después del parto les dan los 60 días y esto da lugar a que no gocen realmente de los 90 días a los que tienen derecho por medio. Bueno pues en esta ocasión quiero comentarles que al en el que se encuentra ahí disponible para ustedes y para todos los trabajadores y trabajadoras la circular número 33 de la Secretaría de Educación de fecha 18 de octubre del 2001. En ella se detalla perfectamente las formas como la trabajadora puede gozar de los 90 días y basta el que la trabajadora lleve la fe de que su hijo nació y está vivo junto con esta circular 33 al ADER se que le corresponda a efecto de que sin más goce de su licencia por donar el permiso. Esperamos que esta información les iba, les pido por favor que la divulguen, la den a conocer porque es muy importante que las trabajadoras y los trabajadores estemos informados de todo lo que es nuestro derecho para poder aplicarlo en el momento que corresponde. Muchas gracias.","Good day, my fellow comrades! I would like to address you again to continue following the instructions of our General Secretary, who has instructed me to inform you regarding the different issues that we have in the area of Social Security. One of them refers to the license of gravity. As you know, the license of gravity is granted for three months, for 90 days or for a month before and two after the birth. We have recently found that in many of our partners the birth is ahead and when you have to give them the first license in 30 days they are cut off and immediately after the birth they give them 60 days and this gives the place that they do not really enjoy from the 90 days to those who have the right to mail. Well, on this occasion I want to tell you that in the The fact that our partners and their husbands, their husbands and their wives, workers, make the right to the 90 days of the full to those who are due to pregnancy, gives place and that also in the work centers, the three months of the license are covered, to those who the worker has the right to, to find out that they are on our website, please look for us as ssnsnt16 is available for all of you and all of you, the Circular Number 33 of the Education Secretariat, on the date of October 18, 2001. In it, the forms of the worker can be perfectly detailed, and the way the worker can enjoy the 90s. And it is enough that the worker has the faith that his son was born and is alive, along with this circular 33, to the adhesion that corresponds to the effect that without more use of its license, it will be more expensive. We hope that this information will be useful to you. I ask you to please, to distribute it, to the aden to know, because it is very important that the workers and our workers are informed of everything that is our right to be able to apply it at the time it corresponds. Thank you very much."

Yes, because it influences a lot I'm just looking for something, maybe imagining something, but related to what I'm seeing. I see what I see around me. A stone, a wood, a piece of its cover. I'm going to the field to look for sheep or fix the electric wire. a bowler of course, I start the rings, I give them to them, what happens if the mini ball is given, just like that, they fall on the ball, just like that one that I showed you there, and all that, we think about doing with this, we think about making canastos, you can do many things, it is not necessary that I make a plate to make a jewel, Yes, yes.

Now 600cc sports bikes are probably the most exciting bikes you can buy, especially good around the track, but they're not cheap. So what we've done is MCN have given myself and my two fellow road testers 1500 pounds to go out and find a U600 and with the change, if there is any change, we can modify them accordingly and then the challenge will be in our next video to go to Donington Park and see how close these bikes can lap to a brand new 2010 ZX6. But in the meantime, we're going to take these bikes in the studio and we're going to see what they're all about. I'm the chief road tester for motorcycle news. The bike is Honda CBR600 FW 1998 Rage. It's the last of the steel frame Honda CBRs before the aluminium frame came in with the revised engine. I've just bought this for £1,350 and I haven't got a lot of work to do to it. It's taxed, it's MOT'd and I'm still having funds for half decent tyres for what money I've got left. There's been a lot. I think this one's the winner. 600S Rad. It's a year 2000 model so it's the last of this shape before it went fuel injected for the K1 and I paid £1300 for it off the MCN website. I got it from a guy in Solly Hole. When I first picked it up it didn't start. We thought it was a dead battery, put a new battery on it, it's actually a directifier. It's all been repaired, it all runs, it's got an MOT, I'm about to tax it and in short it's going to be the winner. So these are our bikes. Now for the next few days we're going to be taking these home, I'm quite confident but I think on the Chesson there's going to be a bit of a dark horse. It's really nice condition, it works and it just might win the test and chance bike. I don't really know where to start with it. It looks like it's being dragged up from the bottom of the channel. What do you think, Drew? the circuit, it needs good tyres, a few of the bits and pieces, the problem is I might have fun with the only 250-foot load. The geosix R, that is a track theme, as simple as that. That would be the weapon of choice for me, but I know he's got some work doing. Got a sticky back brake and a couple of little false niggles. Head shot. Yeah, and there's the Adams. Young chats. Go and just clarify, these two look really nice and they're nice and shiny, but what I'm going to do is to run a set of over hours and spend a couple of days in the workshop. This is going to be like a super spot bike of yesterday. It's going to have proper suspension, proper tyres, proper brake, proper handling. It's going to walk it. Where are you going to get proper engine from? Don't you worry. It might not look beautiful. No, it's not. There's life in the old dog yet. You too might look glamorous, but this is going to be the way it is. Maybe Lincoln along in the back in the chair. Maybe we'll get to the circus.","Welcome to MCN.

Police's voice was probably breathing in the last breath. During this time, many kilometers were long and people were helpless. But there was no other way except waiting. If you get the chance, you will be able to destroy the entire kingdom. Cameraman Vikas Thakur and Atoll Bhatia Jitendra Kumar, News Express Delhi."

I'm Peter Cook in Washington. Welcome to Money in Politics and Happy Friday. More now on the ripple effects from the subprime mortgage mess. Vacant houses, vandalism, frightened neighbors. Think we're talking about inner city America? It's actually a description of a Washington DC suburb decimated by foreclosures. Loomers, Izio Leera reports on the new slums post subprime. Lush yards, good schools, room for kids to play. All the amenities of suburban living. But today's housing crisis means a different story is playing out behind some of these closed doors. Some folks they just give up. They just don't want to continue making the payment. And instead of trying to work something out with the lender, they just walk. This three bedroom house in Woodbridge, Virginia became vacant two months ago after the lender foreclosed. What can I say about this room? Fragments of family life remain as does the monthly bill for a 13.5 percent mortgage. Three years ago, this house sold for $375,000. Elliott is now trying to unload it for $189,000. He sees roughly 90 houses like it every week, a number that threatens to blight this suburb and others across the country. Everyone in the industry is doing what they can, but due to the sheer volume of foreclosures that are out there, there's only so much that they can do. Prince William County, Virginia is about 35 miles south of Washington. Just a few years ago, it could hardly build housing We clearly were the boom community in the Washington metropolitan area for residential housing construction. Now it leads the state with more than 5,000 foreclosures, roughly one in every 100 homes, according to RealtyTrack. It has a spin-off effect not only on real estate values, as demand for property is below supply, but also on things like sales tax and the kind of commercial activity that goes with that group of folks living in the community. You can see the trash in the middle of the city. This is the house that's coming from this yard and the unmowed grass. What you can't see is the smell that's coming from this house or the vandals the neighbors say have broken in. All of this brings down the value of the entire neighborhood. I don't feel like it's safe at all. I said we just have a couple people break into the house's cars. It's terrible. Kudos lived on this tidy street in Prince William's Dale City neighborhood for eight years. She just finished planting her flower beds. I think it's time for us to get up and move. They're thinking about getting up and move too and they've been here 17 years. In this market though, moving will be a challenge. Houses on this street have lost almost half their value in the past few years. Far from the suburban ideal, most of these families were seeking. That's why we moved here with just a good school area and walking distance for elementary and then the high school area.

Luci e D'Ombre hanno detto che questa sera sono attribuibili ai personaggi che si sono alternati nella politica. La legge ha registrato dei passi importanti e dei successi, ma va adeguata? Indubbiamente, diciamo, i tempi si evolvono e le leggi vanno adeguate. 23 del 99 per alcuni versi è andata bene per altri non è andata assolutamente bene. Il mio ripartimento da qualche mese già sta lavorando alla modifica di legge, per cui anche questo convenio indetto dagli architetti della provincia di potenza viene ad hoc, quindi proprio qui noi poi dimostreremo che la regione non sta ferma, apprescindere da quelle che hanno fatto o non hanno fatto altri. Io ho avvertito questa esigenza, per cui al momento opportuno convoccherò La regione basilicata è abbastanza attenta al sviluppo del territorio. e la regione continuerà ad avere il ruolo di guida? La stessa è per concludere, maggiore impegno dell'Areglino, più impiego di fondi. Non dimenticandoci che poi il territorio della pratificata non è facile? Non è facile, un territorio che va attenzionato, ovvero che noi abbiamo fatto lo stiamo facendo e stiamo completando studi importanti sui movimenti franosi di questa regione da mettere a disposizione una cartografia da mettere a disposizione dei comuni, quindi la regione si sta muovendo contatto con intelligenza e cercando di mettere a disposizione sia dei comuni ma anche degli ordini professionali tutti quegli strumenti che poi sono utili nella realizzazione di una qualsiasi cosa che si voglia fare.","The law has recorded important steps of success, but it is still appropriate. The Baselicate region is very attentive to the development of the territory. The region will have a driving role? We will try to do this, so we will ask for collaboration of professional orders that must collaborate in an active way, not to be critical but to be positive. If each of us, within our region, will do our own role, will exercise our own role, I think we will not be able to improve. We have to resolve everything with the funds, with the ideas, with the volunteers, with the hands and so on. In other experiences, we have seen that, even if we are willing to do it, the results of the project have not been achieved. a cartography to put in place of the municipalities, therefore the region is moving in contact with intelligence, trying to put in place both municipalities but also professional orders, all those instruments that are then useful in the implementation of anything that you want to do."

I was commenting on a part of the modder. I decided between Hail Rich and, you know, I put the modder, but hey, I don't know if you can hear it, but there's bad weather here. With that, I'll do the end of the world tomorrow. Let's see what I ask tomorrow. In fact, the channel will start the new year, but I'm excited. I'll start it before but as if the world ended I was going to say no I'm not a video I'm my video I'm not going to talk about the classic that I used to use because I'm going to change it until it starts to play again the model I will play when I go better because right now to your mother I will not let me play the truth I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next videos I will use the gun in the next I was a specialist, I just changed it because I wanted the challenges that give you to run, for example the extreme condition to run I don't know how many kilometers or meters and to get it out who knows how many times and that's what I wanted, that's why I changed it, I was with them with that and well almost all the matches of the mother will be of low confirmation It was the only thing I played in the Modern Warfare. I think I'll start playing it again, I'll change it, I'll put something else, and I'll go up from that thing. Of course, it's just that it's players, I don't know how it is, like the Modern, I haven't played it, it's been in Black Ops and in other games, but let's see what happens with the Modern, I don't know what happens with him. And well, now it's not good, it will be difficult, I know it's a good match with so much luck, but I hope it's a good match and I hope the weather gets better too so there's no so much luck and I can get a good match and meanwhile I think that if the weather is like this I'll be going up the ones I have saved, which is what I've been doing and now I think that's all I can comment, so I'm going to leave the match Thanks for watching the video, please subscribe, like the videos, please. I'm sorry I'm starting, but I'm a bit exaggerated. I want the first month to have 30 subscribers and everything. I'm a bit exaggerated. I want that. If you can, I want that.

Fred Lispork with Star Knight in. Mine's integrated. I've got two things integrated which is pretty cool. You can see the crown ricey headset. Pretty lucky. Okay, so MaxForks. The SCS obviously Pro. I'm using Pro. There's loads of different ones like Apex, Blazor Pro, which I... they're not the legitists. Yeah there's loads of other ones. But your bars with no slit whatsoever, you have to cut... if there is then like you can just go to your nearest dollarama or poundland to get one like to cut off the end. Your Fred Bliss headset, I'm cos my deck's integrated. I'm using the District Integrated headset. It's so good. I highly recommend the Deck headset. like all district stuff and I highly recommend these forks are amazing. Okay so step one, you want to put your forks into the head tube. Make sure your bearings are in obviously. Make sure your compression ring, that's the silver bit that goes around it. I'm moving right now. Make sure that's in there, if it isn't then the compression system will turn out a little bit which won't spin your... You don't need this but it is better This is the test to see if you need spacers. up as tall then you're not going to need space but if it rises up then just buy some spaces or get some spaces off your bike or something and then just keep on testing it until the shim doesn't move. You can either do that or before you put them in your star knight you can just cut your forks down. So now you've put your SCS on where I've extracted it. get my 5mm. whatever end your bolt is and tighten it up. Once it's moderately tight, like just about nearly tight, gonna wanna turn it up as tight as it gets. Hey, that's tight, it's all good. And like that, if everything's tight like wheels and like your bolts aren't moving, then it should be solid scooter. Don't worry about if it doesn't spin that much because it will spin much better with the bars on. Okay, so after you've kind of tightened that up, you wanna put your bars in and then make sure they're in alignment. They look into alignment to me. Once you've done that, you're always going to want to start tying it up from the bottom, but don't actually tighten it, just make sure the bolts inside the actual casing thing. Then at the top, you're always going to want to do that one up first, so it pinches the bars because over time when you're scootering, the bars slowly come out of the actual SCS. Make sure they're pinched first and then you can start from the bottom, down to the top. I use this ratchet, it's 5mm on it, it's just brilliant. It hasn't sheared any of my bolts, not circled in nothing. It's just really good. So I'm going to tighten them all up. Okay, so after they're all tight, then you should have no wobble, you should tighten it up good. And your bar should spin quite smooth, if you've got a suit head set. And you should have a solid scooter. Yeah, it's dulled.","Hi guys today, I'm gonna be doing a little YouTube video here on how to install a Pro2 SCS Yeah, let's go on to what you need Fred Lispork with Star Knight in mind inscrated I've got two things inscrated which is pretty cool. You see the crown ricey headset Yes, obviously Pro. I'm using pro there's loads of different ones like apex which I... they're not the legitists. Yeah there's loads of other ones. But your bars with no slit whatsoever, you have to cut... if there is, then like you can just go to your nearest dollarama or poundland to get one, like to cut off the end. Your Fred Bliss headset, I'm... because my deck's integrated, I'm using the District Integrated headset. It's so good. I highly recommend the Deck headset. like all district stuff and I highly recommend these forks are amazing. Okay so step one, you want to put your forks into the head tube. Make sure your bearings are in obviously. Make sure your compression ring, that's the silver bit that goes around it. I'm moving right now. Make sure that's in there, if it isn't then the compression system will turn up a little bit which won't spin your, you don't need this but it is better to have the dust cap thingy on, dust protector I think it's called. It just looks called a really. After you've done that, you're gonna wanna, as you can see like that, this is if you need spacers or not. If you need, this is the test to see if you need spacers. You put a SCS on, obviously make sure the star nut thing's inside with the shim, take the bolt out, and then clamp it down like that. If the shim doesn't ride up as tall then you're not going to need space but if it rises up then just buy some spaces or get some spaces off your bike or something and then just keep on testing it until the shim doesn't move. You can either do that or before you put them in your star knight you can just cut your forks down. So now you've put your SCS on, well I've restricted it, that's it, that's near. get my 5mm. whatever end your bolt is and tighten it up. Once it's moderately tight, like just about nearly tight, gonna wanna turn it up as tight as it gets. Okay, so that's tight, it's all good. And like that if everything's tight like wheels and like your bolts aren't moving then it should be solid scooter. Don't worry about if it doesn't spin that much because it will spin much better with the bars on. Okay, so after you've kind of tightened that up, you wanna put your bars in and then make sure they're in alignment. They look into alignment to me. Once you've done that, you're always going to want to start tying it up from the bottom, but don't actually tighten it, just make sure the bolt's inside the actual casing thing. Then at the top, you're always going to want to do that one up first, so it pinches the bars because over time when you're scootering, the bars slowly come out of the actual SCS. Make sure they're pinched first and then you can start from the bottom, down to the top. I use this ratchet, it's 5mm on it, it's just brilliant. It hasn't sheared any of my bolts, not circled in nothing. It's just really good. So I'm going to tighten them all up. Okay so after they're all tight, then you should have no wobble if you've tightened it up good. And your bar should spin quite smooth if you've got a suit head set. And you should have a solid scooter. Yeah, it's dulled."

Waarom aan de muur? Zomaar kunstvandaag de gast bij Kaja Kreintse Locker en het portret van haar boefje Henkie. Dit is een houten kunstwerk gemaakt van sloophout door Didrik Kraijveld. En dat heb ik laten maken omdat ik was een keer bij hem en ik vond... zoals hij dat maakte, dat vond ik gewoon niet alleen kunst, maar ook heel kunstig. En ik wilde graag mijn hond Henkie... Ik wilde graag een kunstwerk van. Diederik heeft dat voor mij gemaakt. Met Pinks er was er een open atelierroute in Hilversum. En toen was ik daar gaan kijken. En toen kwam ik dus ook bij Diederik in het atelier. En ik was gelijk getroffen door wat hij maakte. Want het is zo speciaal. Ik heb nog nooit zo iets gezien, dus vandaar. Hij verzamelt sloophout. En hij probeert ook... wat hij maakt ook een stukje sloophoud van iemand zelf te maken. Bijvoorbeeld in dit kunstwerk is dit stukje en ik moet even zoeken hoor. Nou kan het zich gewoon niet meer vinden. Maar in ieder geval twee stukjes zitten erin van een plank die dan wel eens waar niet helemaal van mijzelf is, maar van het oude huis van de buren wat gesloopt is. En het andere is dus allemaal sloophoud. Dit komt van een herenhuis in Hilvershuis. Het staat aan de achterkant precies waar het allemaal vandaan komt. En zo maakt hij dat allemaal. Hij schildert er niks aan. Hij zacht het allemaal van stukjes loophoud. En hoe hij het doet, ik snap het niet. Maar ik vind het fantastisch. Daar zit staan wel een vijfde ongeveer van Henkie zal zijn. Het is sprekend Henkie, want toen het onthuld werd, had ik wel heel emotioneel geweest. Want je kunt natuurlijk een plaatje van een hond zien. En dit is gewoon Henkie, het is gewoon zijn hele karakter zit erin.","What is the reason behind the wall in the Netherlands? Today, Kaja Kreintse Locker and her bouffier, Henkie, is an art work by Diederik Kraijveld. I let him do that because I was with him once. As he did, I thought it was not only art, but also very artistic. I wanted to make my dog Henkie. I wanted to do a piece of art. Didrik made it for me. At the time, there was a open studio in Hilversum. I was there to watch it. I came to Didrik's studio. I was immediately impressed by what he did. It's so special. I've never seen anything like it. He collected the wood. He also tried to... This piece is also a piece of the lock of someone's own. For example, in this piece of art, I have to search for it. I can't find it anymore. But at least two pieces are in there, from a plank that is not entirely from me, but from the old house of the neighbours. The other is the lock of the other. This comes from a gentleman's house in Hilvers. It's exactly where it all comes from. And that's how he makes it all. He doesn't draw anything. He makes... He sees it all in pieces. He keeps it up. I don't understand how he does it, but I think it's fantastic. The glasses I won with Henkie, I wouldn't know the number. But if you look in the box, you can see a whole wall. And I think of the number of glasses you have there. There's something about 5th of Henkie. It's a speaking Henkie. When I was in the entertainment industry, I was very emotional. You can see a picture of a dog. This is Henkie. It's her character."

Nós sabemos que Goiânia tem muitos questões, mas o Senhor tem o suor, Ele quer atrair o coração da Moiva de volta para Ele. E aquele primeiro amor, muitos desviados também, vai estar retornando ao amor do Senhor, através da que vai ser profetizero desta noite. Não apenas as vezes que vão estar ali, vão estar ouvindo esse chamado de volta para o Senhor, mas nos céus dessas cidades, vão estar liberando-o alto. Vai estar alcançando os próximos dias, vão ser os testemunhos de muitos e muitos desejos voltando para o Senhor e de muitos e muitos crenços, Senhor Jesus, que vão ter o coração reaquecido. Você já acabou de sair de uma gravação agora em Misi, no Júlio. Eu sei que vocês tudo fazem na direção de Deus. Você é um espetáculo de fazer gravação aqui no Enem. Ah, legal! O senhor ainda não falou sobre isso. Mas eu creio que pela graça dele ser nos 10 muitos anos ainda servindo aqui na nossa nação, nós estaríamos totalmente abrindo. o coração da tenda, não sabemos quando, o que o Senhor vai fazer, mas estamos a ver. Eu quero mais uma pergunta, muito importante, fácil, porque eu digo mais também. Que você diz sobre a invasão do meio góscola, da igreja, no meio, na mídia secular? Os vários artistas que têm se convertido com a gente, Jesus, qual é a sua visão sobre isso? Eu acredito que isso é o comprimento da palavra do Senhor É a extensão do reino do Senhor chegando em lugares aonde não chegava antes. Nós temos visto portas abertas que há alguns anos atrás pareciam impossíveis, mas o Senhor tem abertas as formas. Deus Ele quer alcançar o pobre e o rico. Ele quer alcançar o famoso e o influente. E aqui ele fica em estado o nome dele. Todos cresceram de Jesus. Então nós acreditamos que o tempo de alcançar pessoas que antes era o inatil de ídias, entrar em lugares onde antes não entrarmos como a Angéria é chegar. Nos tempos dos dias nós vimos pessoas rígidas e pessoas pobres, termos indo sempre. Nós vimos pessoas importantes, governantes, e também pessoas simples, de não revolta. Nosso tempo também nós queremos ver todo tipo de gente, todo lugar, ter nós corpos, apenas para entrar na palavra de Deus. É isso, agradeço a atenção de vocês, agradeço a Adriana também. Vocês são muito felizes aqui em Goiã. Vó, tem mais vezes em Novo Chesco. Bom, tá?","What is the feeling of being in Goéna? We are very happy, since the first time we have been in Goéna, for a very important event for us, for a day, a year, here, every time we come here, we really feel like we are alive, with the special thing he did. And the feeling we have for this night, that we are not very much aware of, is that the Lord will really be releasing a special call specifically to the Lord's presence to return to Him. We know that Goiânia has many questions, but the Lord has only one, He wants to bring the heart of the Holy Spirit back to Him. That first love, many evidences also, will be returning to the love of the Lord through the and will always be profited from this night. Not only will the days that will be there be the call of God to the Lord, but in the heavens of these cities, the Lord will be there filling the room. He will be reaching the next days, the future, many and many desires will return to the Lord and many and many faiths will come to the Lord, who will have a warm heart, a diamond, a consecration to the Lord. I feel like I'm in a position to do it. So, you just finished a recording, now in the beginning, I swear. And I know that you all do it in the direction of God. Do you have any expectations of doing the recording here in the UN? Ah, legal! But I still haven't talked about it. But I believe that thanks to him being in the land for many years, still serving here in our nation, we will be totally There are some people who already have me sent some girls, look, this girl here needs to receive a email with photos of a city close to Trindade. Today happens in a big festival, right? And the other brought this sister of the address, look, pay attention to Trindade, come back to the city, I have a question that I really like, that I think it's very easy to read, that you said about the invasion of the middle gospel, of the church, of the secular media, the various artists that have become the subject of this, what is your view on this? I have heard that this is the fulfillment of the word of the Lord, It is the extension of the kingdom of the Lord arriving in places where we did not arrive before. We have seen open doors that, in a few years ago, seemed impossible, but the Lord has opened these doors. God wants to reach the poor and the rich. He wants to reach the famous, the influential and here he is, who knows his name. Everyone knows Jesus. So we believe that the time to reach the people who, before We were in native languages, we entered places where we did not enter before, as in the Angelic language, it is to arrive. In the times of Jesus we saw people who were there and people who were always there. We saw important people who were there before, who were there seeing and also simple people who did not return. Our time also, we want to see all kinds of people, all places, having the right to enter the word of God.

One more time, it's my fault that I lack the focus to see it through. You may see me the master, but I don't believe it too. You're laughing at me child, but are you really laughing at you? It's my fault that it took me to here to risk everything that I ever built and blame everything and everyone here. But it's not too late for me, no, and it's not too late for you to cast aside your boundaries and finally see it through. What do you really want? What do you really fear that you might actually make it? Is that your final fear?"

Ah, enfim, tudo que envolva o microfone isso aqui vai ajudar bastante, tá? Então, vamos lá! Bom, primeiro você precisa clicar com o botão direito nessa caixinha de som aqui do lado do relógio, né? E você vem aqui em dispositivos de gravação. E aqui vai abrir o microfone que você estiver usando, né? Nesse caso aqui devia estar mexendo mais aqui, mas... Se está aí, então está bom. Mas, em seguida você tem que prestar uma atenção para ver se você está selecionando o microfone certo, porque dependendo do computador tem várias outras entradas de microfone, então você seleciona a certa. Eu estou usando aqui o do notebook e tem um microfone já embutido e o que eu estou usando aqui é o microfone externo. Então você presta bem atenção e vê se está na tomada certa, que aparece aqui o painel e e necessidade. tem que tomar cuidado com o headset ou microfone que você estiver usando. E isso aqui chega até 30 dB extras, pelo menos para mim. E se você colocar o 30, se você tiver um microfone bom, o audio vai ficar um pouco chiado. Então, deixa sempre procura, deixar sempre aqui no 10 ou no 20 dB que fica ótimo, fica perfeito. Então, é isso. Esse vídeo aqui foi bem curtinho mesmo, é só para mostrar aqui. para vocês que estão com problemas no microfone e também que querem aumentar para jogar algum jogo, inclusive se você quer fazer gameplays com comentários ao vivo você tem que tomar cuidado para regular aqui o microfone bem e abaixar bastante o volume do jogo para essa voz ficar clara. Certo? Então é isso aí, esse vídeo aqui também estou fazendo aí para dar uma ajudinha ao Kingsbreaker que ele quer o mais novo brother aqui então também estou ajudando ele né tá com problemas aí para regular o microfone e aí isso é muito simples você só precisa mexer nessas duas coisinhas aqui para melhorar o áudio do seu microfone e é isso aí muito obrigado não esqueça de avaliar o vídeo e de deixar o seu comentário muito obrigado valeu e tchau tchau","Welcome to another video, not gameplay. Today I will show you, there are two postings and only one of them, it never happened and I hope I can happen again. But this time it's just to compensate for the time lost on my channel, because as I explained in the game play of Max Payne, I'm really delaying things here to the channel, This is a tutorial to regulate the quality and sound of your microphone. to improve the audio of your microphone in some game. Anyway, everything that involves the microphone will help a lot. So let's go! Well, first you need to click with the right button in this box of sound here on the side of the clock, and you come here at recording devices. And here you will open the microphone that you are using, in this case it should be moving more here, but If it's there, then it's good. But if you have to pay attention to see if you're selecting the right microphone because depending on the computer there are several other microphone inputs so you select right, right? I'm using the notebook and there's a microphone already embedded and what I'm using here is the external microphone, right? So you pay attention and see if it's in the right take, right? This is the front panel, so it's right. This front panel is for me, so it's for you. First you come here in advanced, and here you choose the quality of the studio, which is as high as possible. If you have a very strong microphone, for sure it will have a higher quality, so you select for the audio to be very, very good and really changes. This is fact, right? and it will return to the microphone audio in 49 and so you always have to be connected to put in 100 to have a good regulation, right? This one is the extra audio, the extra microphone sound you don't necessarily need to use, only when you see the microphone, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, you will not have to use it, I put here in this 10 dB extra, there are more in front, to the audio to be a little higher and improve, but depending on your microphone, if it is not very good, if you increase this sensitivity, the microphone is very bad, it is too boring, I also tested it with the headset microphone, which is very weak, the audio was horrible, so you you have to be careful with the headset or microphone you're using. And this one reaches up to 30 dB extra, at least for me. And if you put 30 dB extra, if you have a good microphone, the audio will be a little boring. So, always try to leave it here at 10 or 20 dB, which is great, it's perfect. So, that's it. This video was really fun, just to show and also want to increase to play some game, even if you want to play gameplays with live comments, you have to be careful to adjust the microphone well and lower the volume of the game to be clear, right? So that's it, this video here too, I'm doing it to help the King's Breaker, who is the youngest brother I'm helping him, he has problems to adjust the microphone. And that's it, it's very simple, you just need to move these two things here to improve the audio of your microphone. And that's it, thank you very much, don't forget to evaluate the video and leave your comment. Thank you very much, thanks and bye bye."

Is it difficult to decide to return to the new Czech Republic? Yes, I was in Bulgaria for 4 years and I am more or less the same. I am the first person to leave the country, so I prefer to leave the country where I want to go. I am waiting for the next time and I know that I will be there. I was not very difficult.

En esta versión se incorporan todas las novedades surgidas desde el año 95 hasta el momento. Su principal diferencia con los primeros es que usa el sistema de archivos FAT32, lo que hace más rápido ya que armacena los datos más eficaz. Lo que crea varios cientos de megabytes de espacio en disco adicional de la unidad. Además los programas ejecutan más rápidamente y el equipo utiliza menos recursos del sistema.

The main difference with the first ones is that it uses the FAT32 file system, which makes it faster as it stores the most efficient data. which creates hundreds of megabytes of additional space in the unit's additional disk. In addition, the programs run faster and the team uses less resources from the system. The Microsoft Windows 98 operating system offers a higher quality for the computer, including better performance of the system and a simpler maintenance. Windows 98 Second Edition is a update of Windows 98 published on May 5, Windows 98 includes corrections for many minor problems. A USB support improved and the replacement of Internet Explorer 4.0 by the considerably faster Internet Explorer 5.0. Also included the shared internet connection. System requirements. Processor 486x2 to 600 MHz or higher. 16 MB of RAM is recommended 24 MB. The amount of space is enough depending on the installation method and the components you have selected. and the system's payment, being much faster than Windows 95. I hope you enjoyed the information I gave you. Thank you."

Se dire che mi è sistito vuole cambiare area perché non si trova più bene, effettivamente lo soffre. Sta tolando con la sfera di stina, certo? Sì, grazie per queste dichiarazioni, cari amici, avete sentito momenti palpitanti, in grado di sforzo, mi sembra che quasi tutti i giocatori vogliano lasciare la casaca biancazzuto, proprio adesso, quello che stai parlando in questa insolata di mercato. Adesso mandiamo un'attima nuovosita a dopo la condividenza del nostro programma.","Hi friends of Sky Sporting 24, here with us is Mr. Angelo Castarà. Mr. Castarà, thank you for being here with us. What do you think about the fact that there are voices that want it more than the Sporting Jadim? I have the right voice, I'm calm, so what I hear I don't think it's my part. I make the results speak, and the team doesn't have any part. Here we say that the master has been clear about the voices on his account, Thank you again and thank you to the Sky Sporting fans. The next year, the sports in the club will be closed due to the market's contractuality. the gardeners are willing to wear a new jacket. We do not know yet what the motivations are that trigger this phenomenon. In short, we will try to enter to have further information. Let's talk about the players who are already inside. Cirino Cali, who has said that Argeggi is a monk, and of course, as the captain of Christian Corica also says, he seems very close to leaving the Sporting and Beggiardine, he who is a great believer in society. From the whole sporting, we take the list of the unfortunate, of the long-term, of the Sporting and Beggiardine, who are the attackers of the Monaco, Giuseppe Dosto, Argeggi who had the same fortune as Kosci Alestra, a first-class host, a month of support for them, After 30 years of career without having had the opportunity, I have told you about Cuba G, at the end of the career for the attacker of the Spotinga Big Giardini, we are happy that he has sometimes been able to do some infiltrations. I say to myself that at this moment it seems to be in a crisis, I am in a domain for care, thanks to them. We are waiting for this moment that you have not said that you have been in Cuba for about three weeks. Let's see if we can find the light on this mystery. The result of the 4 divided day of the change of the team category has been achieved. While the Ciphi has three goals, he has been recovered from the Malfunction of Malvania, finished 3-3 in the final result, while the Graniuri has won an incredible amount of 2-2 points, with the second round of the Falaci attacker. In this case, the Cacifino has the sporting and aceticotomy, with a 25 points penalty in the back of the Ciphi, now at 5-1. In the end, we can now see the exclusive images that our guest Puglia has collected mysteriously, with good images. Imagine the ones that are related to the captain Cristian Corica, we have the phone connection with the sub-contractor. Good evening, I'm Mattes. Good evening. Thank you for holding our microphones. Do we want to talk about the images we saw? I think that the players want to change the air because it is not the best situation for the players. Now we go to the next video after the introduction of our program."

Esta hora vamos a saludar en homes a Sami Brahim, representante de la red de derechos humanos de Siria. Le decimos muy buenos días al señor Brahim. Gracias por estar con nosotros, nuestros televidentes de Estados Unidos de América Latina. Bienvenido. Gracias, gracias a ustedes. De acuerdo, quisieramos saber de acuerdo a su organización, quienes perpetraron esta masacre. Se habla del ejército sirio, pero ustedes particularmente a quienes acusan y en qué situaciones que se dieron este tipo de hechos. Sabemos que las familias que estuvieron involucradas en esta masacre acusan a la armada de Bajar al Azad por esta masacre. Tenemos los testimonios de por lo menos 60 familias y todos ellos nos han informado que los tanques de Bajar al Azad tomaron como objetivo sus hogares a matar a las familias y a los niños en esa zona. Bajarlasado es responsable por todos estos asesinatos cometidos por sus propias fuerzas armadas. Y habrá un gran movimiento en las Naciones Unidas en contra de bajarlasado, al menos eso es lo que esperamos. Ellos han continuado haciendo estos, estos masacres y han continuado con las matanzas y los asesinatos. Este es un pequeño, una pequeña población cerca de Hama. Y este es un pueblo bastión de la oposición a bacharlasad. Y esto se ha indicado de manera muy clara que bacharlasad ha matado a las personas y después las personas también algunas fueron torturadas y ellos han tratado de esconder estas masacres por todos los medios posibles. hemos podido documentar entre las personas, por lo menos nueve niños muertos y más mujeres. Tenemos fotografías que no podemos mostrar y vídeos. Pero es importante que tengamos estos documentos para que todo el mundo pueda ver y pueda encontrarse con esas familias. mujeres, niños en la provincia de Hama. ¿Existe algún interés en particular, de parte de como ustedes señalan de la armada de Bayar al Asad, al Asad de atacar a estas personas a los grupos más indefensos? Estamos hablando de que no es una situación que se presenta ahora, sino que ya se presentó con anterioridad. los asesinatos. están arrestando. Hay 2.261 personas detenidas desde que comenzó la misión del señor Anand. 2.261 personas que hemos documentado. Así que Bajar al Azad no le importa los derechos humanos, no le importa el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. Es simplemente un dictador quiere hacer lo que quiere y continuará matando a las personas para que termine esta revolución, como sea. en el país. contra el régimen, porque ellos continúan torturando a las personas y están matando a las mujeres y los niños. Hacen esto incluso dentro de las presiones con las mujeres, tiene más de 100 personas, 100 mujeres dentro de estas presiones a las cuales torturan como un castigo a la población. Así que nosotros esperamos una acción inmediata. Por parte de la comunidad internacional necesitamos protección para que se detenga estas matanzas y estos asesinatos. Estamos esperando una reacción porque no podemos controlar más esta situación y en realidad tenemos miedo porque hay poco movimiento en el Consejo de Seguridad. Esperamos que se le de a bacharlas a toda la responsabilidad por lo que está haciendo y que esto tenga una solución futura pronta.","NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN and they were involved in this massacre. They began to kill families and children in that area. They were to lower the rapes responsible for all these murders committed by their armed forces. And now there will be a great movement in the United Nations against lowering the rapes, or at least that's what we expect. They have continued to do these massacres and they have continued to kill and kill them. a small population near the Hamah. And this is a people, a bastion of the opposition to lower the SAAD. And this has been very clear that the SAAD has killed people. And then people were tortured, and they have tried to hide these massacres from all possible means. We have been able to document among people at least nine dead children and more women. We have photographs that we cannot show and videos. But it is important that we have these documents so that everyone can see and can meet with those families. Women, children in the province of Hama, does any particular interest exist? As you pointed out, the army of Bashar al-Assad, attacking these people, the most defenseless groups? We are talking about a situation that is now presented, but that has already been presented with priority. They want people to be afraid, to stop the revolution. They want them to end up with their struggle. They want them to execute all the people who continue. They want the regime to not change. That's what they want. That's why they kill women and children. Why would they attack homes and other Syrian cities? Why would they torture people? They are not criminals. but they will continue with the murders and we as human rights organizations will continue denouncing these events because there is no military protection, there is no military action against these criminals, to lower the chains of a monster and will continue killing thousands of people and will not stop, it does not matter to the plan of peace of cofianan and will not free the prisoners, They are arresting. There are 2,261 people detained since the mission of Mr. Anand began. 2,261 people that we have documented. So, to lower the rate, it does not matter to us human rights. It does not matter to the UN Security Council. It is simply a dictator who wants to do what he wants and will continue to kill people so that this revolution ends, whatever it is. The UN Special Envoy will deliver his report on the situation in Syria, before the Security Council. What measures do you expect real measures that will adopt the international community regarding Syria? They are torturing people. They are killing women and children. They even do this within the prison with women. They have more than 100 people, 100 women within these prisons, which they torture as a punishment to the population. So we expect an immediate action. We are waiting for a reaction because we cannot control this situation anymore. And we are actually afraid because there is little movement in the Security Council. We hope that all the responsibility is given to the Assad regime for what it is doing and that this will have a future solution soon. Thank you to Sami Ibrahim, representative of the Human Rights Network of Syria."

And again, you probably know this when you refresh your memory on how the Dairy Support Program works now. In surplus situations, theoretically what's supposed to happen is if there's too much bounty in produce or more than consumers are going to buy, we take that job and put it into, for example, 40-pound blocks of cheese. If we can't sell all the cheese, the federal government will buy it after any turn in price. and same for the nonfat dry milk. And that price that they pay for that cheese butter part is supposed to be converted to a milk price, a basic milk price at dairy farms you're supposed to get. Well what has happened, you know, we've had $10 milk for the last nine months. The only commodity that's gone to the government is nonfat dry milk. No cheese has been sold to the government. There's a lot of reasons why that has happened. As I know here, we think it's a distance, it gives a distance set up to innovation. We have a lot of people who are doing this. 50% of all the A-Solids that are produced in this country are exported. It's the one product that we can consistently compete on a low-wide basis. Now, compared to non-fat dry milk, nobody is innovating with that protein portion of milk because you can't justify an investment because if the level of that price ever gets down to where the support price is for non-fat, you sell it to the government. So people aren't innovating. And as a result of that, you cannot be a consistent export. We think that that program should be replaced. Now this is one that I think, or might get rocks on at me, but we also think that we should do a little bit of the MILC program. So you replace the existing support programs that we have in the MILC, but you replace that with a producer income insurance program. And the government is going to save some money by not having any support prices. And we think that there's going to be money available that they can fund an insurance program for dairy farmers Let's call it a catastrophic level of price support. So that your melt price essentially would never go below $10. The free market could work. Product prices could go down. The melt price could go down. In fact, your price would never go below a floor because of that insurance. We think that this could be treated kind of like puts and calls to where you've got a catastrophic level. And if you want a higher level of protection, you as a producer could pay for that. Let's just say the floor that the government is going to support is $10. If you want to buy up to $12, I would hand the opportunity to protect you for that level. Okay? And then lastly, we think that CWT should be enhanced and to provide some better opportunities for the industry to work on its own problems. We think that we can have some plans here for a partial herd retirement program. We think the export assistance program can be enhanced. We also think that we can use some dollars to buy and maybe utilize marketing agencies in common. Remember, this is a voluntary program today and only cooperatives can participate in it because otherwise it's a monopoly. But we think that cooperatives can work together a little more formally and create an agency in common for exporting cheese, for example. The problem today with the CWT program is that there's about two thirds of the bulk that's paying into the fund and supporting it. And a third of the dairy farmers, or a third of the property, around the country is not supported yet. So as it's structured today, it will not be able to continue. There's just an issue with what's referred to as free riders that will not move forward unless it's changed in the hands. So if you look at this comprehensive plan, again, don't look at this as just one more piece. You'll just fit a order reform or change in support programs. You have to look at all of this together. Here's what we think are some of the benefits. First of all, I think couples and uprisings from the CME, everybody criticism of this? It's a competitive situation for two years, it cannot do it today because you just can't be competitive because of that fluctuation in the form of a price. We think that the federal reform, when we get a better price discovery, we think that we can use some of the peaks and the valleys and the non-prices. And let me just make one point. You can never eliminate volatility. If you're thinking that we're going to get a 14 or 15 or 16 dollar price and hold that steady, that ain't going to happen. 20 years ago we had less volatility than today, but what we had that was a program where the government was buying surplus products and warehouses were full. Taxpayers were not going to let us get back. So for always when we have some volatility what we have to do is try to manage it and try to get those peats and valleys shaved off and operate in a more narrow and normal range. We think that if the federal order for reform we can get an opportunity to hire value products. If the butter and flour are good, as much money or if you're not as valuable as making cheese, you should have the incentive to make cheese. And that just doesn't happen because of our prices and mechanisms today. People are making butter powder because of the pool draws that's what I think are able to pay the same price as if you're making cheese. We think that through this program we're going to have more consistent export business. I have to say this, that we are becoming a more global economy and we're going to be part of a global business now. And when you think of that initially, you think, yeah, well that means that we're going to have the ability to export. Think about this thought. If we're in a global economy, that means that people have the ability to import. And as much as you want to talk about isolationism and managing your own business, we're always going to have to have imports coming into this country. And if our pricing gets too out of whack for us in the world, imports are going to continue to come into this country and I don't think it's avoidable. I just want to make a point here that our industry has to take some lessons from the auto industry. The auto industry made some mistakes. Two mistakes in my mind. Number one is they didn't make the cars that consumers wanted for whatever reason. Toyota and Honda and those guys did. Secondly, they let their cost structures get out of whack with the rest of the world. Labor cost, pension cost, all these things. We as an industry can't let that happen because I have an Indian auto industry. You got Toyota and Honda and Akia and all those companies waiting in the lanes to take over market share for us. And don't kid yourself that that can happen in the very industry. Look around and see where the investments have been made in the last two years in this country. Go ahead and be up there from Ireland. So Pudo and Andrew are from Canada. La La from Mexico are making massive investments in this country. And don't kid yourself that they want to invest in the country. products and drop them down if they need to from a cost-efficient standpoint. So we have to be very, very careful in positioning ourselves for the long term. And then lastly, or second lastly, we think that this will help facilitate industry growth. We don't want to curtail growth and the growth opportunities, especially here in the Midwest. We're in an opportunity now where we can gain market share back from the rest of the world and we don't want to stop. We want to give you as dairy farmers every opportunity to grow your business, be profitable for the long term. turner we don't want to squelch that in any way, shape or form.

We reserve our salmon, we are going to make our dogs in juliana, we are going to cut in half, that are thin and thin to make the garnish of our salmon. Where we say the salmon, to make it more consistent, we are going to put a little of the barbecue, which is cold, because we already have our barbecue hot, we are going to remove excess broth or water, and we are going to add a little cheese. This cheese, as we are going to put it in a tin, it will help us to press it, so it is well pressed, to assemble the pyramid. We will use this ring to assemble the pyramid. We will add a little olive oil so that it does not stick to us. The salmon is the size of the ring. The amount of the salmon is around the top. We will assemble our wild rice and we will appreciate it very well. Our salmon will fall We will put the sparrows in the decoration We will decorate it We choose a rose to put in our salmon We insert and we will take it out very carefully We will cover our salmon with a glass of wine We will add a little bit of the remaining rose and ready to enjoy a knife, a simple recipe, quick, so you can see who I'm going to see"

The business of a multiplier using reversible logic gates is done by low cost by minimizing the reversible number of reversible logic gates for this two four cross four reversible logic gates called DPC gate and PV gate. technology is originated in CMOS design we implementing this low power logic design through reversible logic technique analyzing the parameters propagation delay power analysis are the parameters which are analyzed here in reversible logic domain gate circuit does not lose information n input and n output device for one input only one output will be given for multiple inputs multiple outputs will be getting so this one-to-one mapping is not comes under reversible. It is a gap-based bit and every gate output is not used as input to other gate as a primary output is called gap-based only the unused outputs from a gate are called gap-based. We are reducing many number of gap-based outputs so that the efficiency can be improved well and for we are getting a b equal to a star as the output for b input we are getting q equal to a x as the output and the gates used are b of gate and double ps gate and b of gate reversible double x or gate input the extra reduces the use of more ic for a input t equal to a is given as input same input is given as an output and for b input q equal to a x or b a and b The input vector is IA, ABC and output is Q of PQR. In the case of the XOR operation, the ANB is performing and the operation and the C is the XOR operation. In the case of the WPSK, the WPSK is the combination of two PS, which is used to make more than three input designs. In the reversible multiplier, partial product generation and multi-operant addition is implemented. In the partial product generation, X and Y are given as input and for multi-operant addition, P is given as open. Z1, Z2, Z3, Z7 will be given by partial product multiplication. In partial product generation, it is generated in parallel using 16 PS gates. As shown in diagram 4x4 multiplier. In multi-operant addition, we can implement an n-operant addition using carry save adder. In carry save adder, four operands are used. This is the general block diagram of the multi-operate edition.

Look, this is my colleague. We saw the message that he sent us. From the photo. Both, yes. And we proposed to him to do it live. But he didn't want it anymore. He was angry. You wouldn't like to do it? So we told him that if he didn't do it, he would have destroyed the whole world. Come on, man. Come on, I'm sending the message to the whole world.

Vaughan and Edward Rizzo I give that a Eight out of ten, so that's my review. Thank you for your time Hope to see you later. Please give me a comment on my review. Let me know how I'm doing and I I appreciate that."

Она меня поразила своей простой, и в то же время, очень мне понравился результат. Тут хочу сегодня показать, какие рамочки я делаю. из именно этой техники. Значит, что для этого нужно? Она вот еще одно такое замечание, несмотря на свою простоту, она позволяет вот разгуляться фантазией и в одной той же технике сделать совершенно разные рамочки. Вот сегодня мы попробуем это сделать. Итак, что для этого нужно? Для этого мы берем для простейшей, самой простой трубочки. Я беру рамочки, беру три трубочки. Смазываю. Содединяю их, стараюсь так широкую, узкую. Соблюдаю те же принципы, чередуя сужающиеся и расширяющиеся концы наших трубочек. Промазываю плотно их, прижимаю друг к дружке и промазываю клеем. Не развожу, чтобы он был густой.

It was the beginning of my newspaper weaving. I found, honestly, I don't remember, a baguette from a newspaper. It struck me with its simplicity and at the same time I liked the result. I want to show you what frames I make. What is needed for this? It is one more such a note, despite its simplicity, it allows to walk in a fantasy and in the same technique to make completely different frames. So what is needed for this? For this we take the simplest tube. I take the frames, I take three tubes, grease them, I connect them. I try to make them as wide and narrow as possible. I follow the same principles, alternating the narrowing and expanding ends of our tubes. I press them tightly with a tweezers and I apply glue. I do not spread the glue so that it is thick. I add another tube on top. This is such a simple blank. As for the options, these tubes can be complex and bitter, And here is how it looks like. It is made of three glue sticks."

Nie ma pochodzenia. Czy kiedyś takiego przestępstwa nie było? Ono było, ale nie było aż tak uciążliwe, bo dzisiaj, kiedy każdy z nas ma telefon komórkowy przy sobie, to takie uporczywe rękanie mogły być szczególnie uciążliwe. Ja wam podam przykład z literatury. Gdyby Julia nie chciała, żeby Romeo jej śpiewał pod balkonem, to to też by był stalking. No bo on przychodził, grał na tej gitarze i jej tam po nocach śpiewał. Ale Julia tego chciała. Dlaczego o tym mówię? Znaczy, z namią tego przestępstwa jest nie tylko uporczywość tego rękania, ale to, że druga strona tego nie chce, bo ona może chcieć tego. Bo ktoś powie, że wyjątkowo sympatycznym jest, jak chłopak codziennie daje dziewczynie w szkole różę, ale jeżeli ona tego nie chce, to w tym momencie może powiedzieć, czuje się prześciwioł uporczywie rękana za przestań tych działań. Bo oczywiście bardzo ważnym elementem do oceny, czy mogło dojść do przestępstwa, czy nie, jest również to, o mówił podstawowe dziedziny prawa oraz przedstawił młodzieży zasady funkcjonowania wymiar usprawiedliwości. i na pewno młodzież dużo z tego skorzystała i na pewno weźmie pod uwagę, że pewne swoje postępowania mogą podlegać różnego rodzaju sądom i również karą. Młodzież ze spotkania z ministrem była zadowolona i wyniosła wiele informacji. Wydzieliśmy się też jakie całym konsekwencje w związku z nieprzestrzeganiem tego prawa. Dyrekcja szkoły również wyraziła swoje zadowolenie z wizyty tak ważnego gościa. Było to dla nas ogromne przeżycie. Myślę, że dla młodzieży również spotkać się z ministrem, gdyż mogli uzyskać informacje o prawie, o zadać u ministrowi różne pytania związane z prawem. I było między innymi pytanie o sądy, które działają na terenie Polski. Te sądy zaczęły działać W Lublinie i pan minister mógł bezpośrednio przekazać nam informacje od źródła. Minister Kwiatkowski spotkał się również z kreśniczanami na rynku starego miasta. Nie przekażemy do was. są to niezwykle sympatyczni mieszkańcy. Przed chwilą wspólnie z Wojtkiem Wilkiem, tutajszym kraśnickim posłem rozmawialiśmy z mieszkańcami, wchodziliśmy do sklepów i te rozmowy dla mnie były niezwykle ciekawe, niezwykle interesujące. Jest wiele spraw, które mieszkańców nurtują. Mają to szczęście, że tutaj mają swojego przedstawiciela na wiejskiej, a ja dzisiaj w ramach wizyty w kraśniku miałem zarówno spotkanie z młodzieżą w ramach programu, który od kilkulatra realizujemy edukacji prawną Oczywiście spotkałem się ze swoimi współpracownikami w sądzie. Mariana, z dedykacją nikt nie powie, że się nie spotkaliśmy. Wyjątkowo trafiliśmy. Ale wszystko dobrze, bo pogoda wszystko. Miałem szczęście z rana, widzę. I niech ono trwa dłużej. Dziękuję bardzo. Wszystkiego najlepszego. Dziękuję, powodzenia.","The plant of the electric vehicle mechanic Piotr Musz, the farmer of Podleśka-6 Street. and the right to make a statement. If Julia didn't want Romeo to sing under the balcony, it would be stalking. He would play the guitar and sing at night. But Julia wanted it. Why am I saying this? Because the most important thing is that she was singing. The biggest sign of this crime is not only the support of this hand, but also that the other side does not want it. Because she can want it. Someone will say that it is exceptionally nice when a boy gives girls a rose at school every day, but if she does not want it, then at this point she may say, I feel the support of the hand through you, stop these actions. Because of course, a very important element to assess whether it was possible to get into the crime or not is also whether The lawyer knows or does not know that what he is doing is not wanted by the lawyer. We have introduced a new category of criminal justice. He has discussed the basic law and presented the youth the rules of the justice system. I think that the elements of the law should be known to the youth and the program is carried out by the Ministry of Justice. Among other things, there are lectures and open meetings of the Ministry of Justice, We have a meeting with Krzysztof Kwiatkowski. He is a young man who has taken advantage of it and has taken into account that his actions can be of various kinds of justice and also of punishment. He also presented the achievements of the last few years which have been made in the form of justice. The greatest achievement that the Ministry can be proud of is The decision to make a court in Lublin is a court that will be very fast and will make the court easier. The youth from the meeting with the minister was pleased and brought a lot of information. The meeting with the minister was a fulfillment of our knowledge of society lessons. We are pleased that our whole team has chosen. The meeting with the minister of justice approached us legally in our country. We also learned about the consequences of the injustice of this law. The school director also expressed his satisfaction from visiting such an important guest. It was a great experience for us. I think that for the youth also, to meet with the minister, because they could get information about the law, about the task of asking the minister various questions related to the law. There were, among other things, questions about the courts that work in the Polish area. These courts began to work The minister and the mayor could directly hand over information from the source. Minister Kwiatkowski also met with the farmers in the old town. Thank you very much. We will not forgive you. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.

We ask people to confront reality. Where are they on the life cycle curve? Are they going up or going down? So we've measured companies. We've asked them where they are on the curve. They tell us which number they are. And then we've looked at them. And in the past three years, over the past three years, those companies on the left side of the curve have grown 141% in sales. That's growth over the last three years in one of the toughest of economies. Not only have they grown sales, but their profit margins have nearly doubled. They're increasing sales and making more money. These findings confirm what Georgia Tech has found in two separate studies. The companies whose self-reported strategy is innovation make more money. They make a higher profit margin than those focused on voice of the customer, quality, quick delivery or low cost. In fact, those companies that are proactive have grown employees over the past three years. And not only have they grown employees, but they've grown high-quality quality jobs. The Georgia Tech study shows that those companies focused on innovation as their primary growth strategy on average pay employees more money. If you want good jobs in your economy, innovation, innovation is the path to good quality jobs. Now those companies that have done well, it isn't some magic of where they were. Because in fact, what we find is is when we ask them where they are versus three years ago, their percentage of sales to new customers and a new product and services has grown significantly. In other words, it isn't that they were lucky, it's that they had the skills and the culture to adapt. That as the world changed, they adapt. And that gave them a resilience. These are the folks, these are the folks that we need to grow jobs and wealth in our communities. With innovation, you restart your profitability. Now, what prevents innovation? Couple things. First off, national research shows that 15% of company owners are proactive, 85% are are reactive and there's three degrees of reactive. The proactive of the people that are going to lead instead of following. These are the people we need to nurture. We need to nurture the proactive and we need to take some of those that are somewhat reactive and highly reactive and we need to find ways to accelerate them into being proactive by giving them a disciplined system. Now CEOs tell us though that there's two other problems. One is it can take a long time to see results from innovation and innovation can be very risky. So that's why innovation engineering is focused. laser focused focus focus on helping you increase innovation speed and decrease risk. We do this through innovation leadership communities, which is a three phase process. Phase one is to accelerate some proactive, get some thought leaders to drive. Phase two is to connect the community, creating a community innovation marketplace. And phase three is to restart the reactive. We can't give up on the 85%. We need to restart them, those companies and industries in our communities to get them growing again, accelerating the proactive. Generally, what we'll do is we'll take six proactive companies, meet with them every week, every month, every quarter, and we guarantee their success because we need these thought leaders to set off the chain reaction to create innovation in the community, focusing on new customers, current customers, technology, export. We meet with them individually as a company, and then on a monthly basis, we have CEO innovation forums where the CEOs from the organization get together to be able to talk about what's working, what's not working, and to get hints on how they can accelerate it. This group forms the nucleus for the transformation that will happen in your community. We do this through the classic process. Accelerate existing projects, educate them, and take them through cultural change to transform their culture. Phase two, connect the community. The goal is to connect your community to the world. Through the USA National Innovation Marketplace, which was brought to you by NIST MEP of the Department of Commerce, we have billions in innovations, over a billion dollars in buying requests. These are things we're If you can invent a solution, companies will pay you for. Companies in Ohio are now selling into Scotland. They're selling into Finland. Companies in Kansas are selling to Europe as well. It's happening as people are making connections where small companies who've got the skills and the abilities are now making connections to compete on the global stage. We also list thousands of manufacturing and experts from all of the university experts, the wonderful assets that we have so we can connect to them. to the skills of the contract manufacturers that we have in our local community so that more work gets connected in your community to grow jobs and wealth. It's a digital hub plus a human networks. And the system is designed to take the digital hub to connect your community to the nation, to the world, and then providing resources for the human networks to be able to facilitate connections to help us increase speed and decrease risk with innovation. Phase three is to restart the reactive. Restart getting established companies. I mean quite frankly folks 85% of companies are reactive and They need a jolt to get them going now Oftentimes for them. We have to go much more intense. They need much more intensive care So what we found to be very effective is to take five next generation managers for five days The owner the CEO doesn't attend till day five We focus them on ideas for new and current customers and rather than seven-day cycles of plan-de-use study act We take them through one Power cycles. Ideas are created, ideas are died. Ideas are created, ideas are died. Black belts work with them front line, forcing them to think quicker, harder, faster than they ever had before. And we've done 10 pilots, presented about 50 ideas. Because see at the end, on week day five, the CEO comes in and the employees pitch ideas for growing the organization. The CEO says either yes or no. And the pilots, 80% of ideas are getting a yes from the CEO. This system has been proven to be extremely effective to get established companies that are reactive moving again. It also can be used to accelerate startups. There's a test going on in Maine and one going on in Louisiana to take folks where it normally took nine months for a startup to get there and accelerated down to five days. Restarting reactive. Three steps. Accelerate the proactive, connect the community, restart the reactive. It's not theory, it's real. In various forms it's being done in states right now being used to help grow jobs and wealth in the community. Innovation Engineering, a management system to help your community increase innovation speed and decrease risk.","The path to good paying jobs for communities is innovation.

Through the USA National Innovation Marketplace, which was brought to you by NIST MEP of the Department of Commerce, we have billions in innovations, over a billion dollars in buying requests. These are things we're If you can invent a solution, companies will pay you for. Companies in Ohio are now selling into Scotland, they're selling into Finland. Companies in Kansas are selling to Europe as well. It's happening as people are making connections where small companies who've got the skills and the abilities are now making connections to compete on the global stage. We also list thousands of manufacturing and experts from all of the university experts, the wonderful assets that we have so we can connect to them. to the skills of the contract manufacturers that we have in our local community so that more work gets connected in your community to grow jobs and wealth. It's a digital hub plus a human networks and the system is designed to take the digital hub to connect your community to the nation to the world and then providing resources for the human networks to be able to facilitate connections to help us increase speed and decrease risk with innovation. Phase three is to restart the reactive. Restart getting established companies. I mean quite frankly folks 85% of companies are reactive and They need a jolt to get them going Now oftentimes for them we have to go much more intense. They need much more intensive care So what we found to be very effective is to take five next generation managers for five days The owner the CEO doesn't attend till day five We focus them on ideas for new and current customers and rather than seven-day cycles of plan-to-study act We take them through one Power cycles. Ideas are created, ideas are died. Ideas are created, ideas are died. Black belts work with them front line, forcing them to think quicker, harder, faster than they ever had before. And we've done 10 pilots, presented about 50 ideas. Because see at the end, on week day five, the CEO comes in and the employees pitch ideas for growing the organization. The CEO says either yes or no. And the pilots, 80% of ideas are getting a yes from the CEO. This system has been proven to be extremely effective to get established companies that are reactive moving again. It also can be used to accelerate startups. There's a test going on in Maine and one going on in Louisiana to take folks where it normally took nine months for a startup to get there and accelerated down to five days. Restarting reactive. Three steps. Accelerate the proactive, connect the community, restart the reactive. It's not theory, it's real. In various forms it's being done in states right now being used to help grow jobs and wealth in the community. Innovation Engineering, a management system to help your community increase innovation speed and decrease risk."

Beatriz Ramírez, representante de PROMSEX, interviene en la Comisión de Justicia con opinión favorable sobre los Proyectos de Patrimonio Compartido y Unión Civil.","Rosario Sasieta, Señora Ley, Patrimonio Compartido, Unión Civil Homosexual",24,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/HJrR-HW2F4g.mp3,"La Beatriz, May Lynn Ramírez, representante de Promsex. ¿Qué pasa por ejemplo con una madre como la mía que no tiene marido, que tiene una hija en edad laboral que gana un sueldo, una mamá que gana un sueldo? Ambas alquilamos una propiedad y vivimos alquilando, el sueldo de ella no da para calificar un crédito bancario exclusivamente, el sueldo mío, hay que confesarlo tampoco da para calificar a un crédito bancario, pero si hubiera algún mecanismo legal que nos permitiera consolidar un patrimonio, ambas lo haríamos y dejaríamos de alquilar, ella se que nos guiamos a las políticas que tiene el gobierno como las de Techo propio o mi vivienda. Ese vacío legal que permita a otro tipo de agrupaciones familiares, más allá de las parejas que estén en relación de matrimonio o de convivencia, que son las que entran en la sociedad gananciales tipo de patrimonio autónomo por excelencia, ese vacío legal, esa necesidad de atender a esa población es la que respalda el proyecto de patrimonio compartido. Bien decía la congresista Sassieta que su generalidad no está hecho, esto no es un proyecto y eso debe ser entendido por todas y todos aquellos interesados en la materia. No es un proyecto referido a la comunidad TLGB, transexuales, vianas, bisexuales y gays. No es, o sea pueden ser beneficeros, pero como puede ser cualquier otro ciudadano. La congresista Asasieta hacía, le menciona las estadísticas que vota el Instituto Nacional de Estadística Informática. Según la END de 2009, el 23.8% de familias en nuestro país son familias monoparentales dirigidas por mujeres. Es decir mujeres, que son familia, que merecen una protección legal, el Tribunal Constitucional tiene y ascendas sentencias sobre la necesidad de proteger otros tipos de familia más allá de la familia nuclear porque son una realidad, son una política, una existencia, pero que necesitan todavía políticas públicas y legislativas que les permitan acceder a niveles de bienestar. En esa medida, el proyecto de patrimonio compartido permitiría que dos o más personas sin que mediúna relación familiar entre ellas, sin que mediúna ningún tipo de vínculo necesariamente no reconoce una unión de pareja, no está hecho para eso, es simplemente una, un contrato patrimonial que te permite formar un patrimonio autónomo que hoy en día nadie puede formar. Es decir, hoy día, ¿quién puede ir al banco a acreditar ingresos conjuntos para pasar una evaluación crediticia conjunta? ¿Sólo los cónyuges? ¿Sólo los convivientes? Como institución, nosotros consideramos que eso es limitado. Hay otro tipo de personas que, en el marco de sus relaciones familiares, pero aún fuera de ésta, puede considerar necesario acceder al crédito. La vivienda es hoy en día una de las grandes políticas de Estado el acceso a la vivienda y lamentablemente tenemos vacíos legales que no le permiten a las personas acceder a ese nivel de bienestar. Es en esa medida que nosotros consideramos hablando netamente del proyecto de patrimonio compartido que debe recibir un dictamen favorable porque beneficia a un sector amplio de la población que está referido principalmente a familias monoparentales, principalmente dirigidas por mujeres. Pero también, obviamente, permitirá que otro grupo de colectivos de personas accedan a crédito. Entre ellas, sin duda alguna, una pareja homosexual puede acceder a crédito, pero como puede hacerlo una mamá con su hijo o una mamá con su hija, como pueden hacerlo dos hermanas, como puede hacerlo cualquier persona. Tome en cuenta que el sueldo básico en nuestro país no llega ni a los 600 soles. Y la barrera de acceso a crédito es 1.500, todo el mundo lo sabe. Necesitas por lo menos 1.500 soles para pasar un acceso a crédito y que algún banco de los conocidos acceda si quiera calificar tu expediente. Entonces si uno toma en cuenta eso, la ventaja del proyecto de patrimonio compartido es que no reduce la agrupación entre dos, sino considera un grupo que puede ser de tres personas, tres personas con el sueldo mínimo, tres hermanas que comparten una casa en Alquiler y crían a sus hijos juntas, que la verdad no es poco usual en nuestra realidad, podrían acceder y ahí seguramente de los hondidos que nosotros hemos hecho y los que conocemos propiamente de nuestras realidades cercanas, muchas mujeres interesadas, impactar por medio de este contrato este tipo de patrimonio autónomo que les permita alcanzar niveles de bienestar. En esa medida, solo sobre el tema del patrimonio compartido. Quisiera aprovechar los minutos que me restan para hablar sobre el proyecto de uniones civiles sobre el cual nosotros también tenemos una opinión favorable y voy a plazar explicar por qué. En el derecho, en general, hay dos instituciones que reconocen las uniones afectivas entre las personas. Son el matrimonio y la convivencia. En nuestro país se ha peleado mucho para que recién en 1979 se reconojiera que la convivencia es otra forma de familia de igual categoría y que merece exactamente la misma protección que merece una familia matrimonial. En esa medida, tenemos dos institutos jurídicos sobre los cuales, digamos, en nuestro país hay una definición heterosexual, tiene que ser entre un hombre y una mujer, y más bien tenemos a las parejas homosexuales que no tienen ningún tipo de reconocimiento. Tenemos el régimen del matrimonio y tenemos el régimen de la convivencia. ¿Qué es lo que hace el proyecto de ley presentado por el Congreso el proyecto de ley 4181. No busca igualar el tema al matrimonio, no, el digamos no ha querido onde dar en ese debate, sino que más bien dice bueno de estos dos institutos jurídicos matrimonio y convivencia hagamos que el reconocimiento de las personas homosexuales sea el régimen de la convivencia tal cual por eso si uno revisa el artículo 4 que para nosotros es la principal fortaleza de este proyecto de ley, el proyecto de ley define que las uniones civiles tendrán los mismos derechos y deberían de los que gozan hoy en día la unión de hecho heterosexual. Y eso a qué nos lleva, por ejemplo, todo el mundo lo sabe, hoy en día los convivientes tenemos en este país derechos patrimoniales, pero también tenemos protección frente a la violencia familiar, también tenemos acceso a seguros como pareja porque se reconoce que hay una unión efectiva, tenemos acceso a pensiones de sobrevivencia en el sistema privado, se discute ya por la sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional si tenemos derecho a pensión de biodese en el sistema público, etcétera. y la limitación constitucional. Entonces hagamos lo que decía el congresista Sousa, adaptemos el régimen de unión civil que en el derecho comparado tiene un contenido diverso y hagamos que la unión civil en el Perú de aprobarse esta norma sea una unión civil un régimen espejo del que tienen las uniones convivenciales heterosexuales, definidas heterosexuales en nuestra constitución. Podemos discutir si eso es así o no, debería ser así o no, pero es así realmente. Entonces lo que propone el proyecto de ley es una unión civil definida como un régimen espejo de lo que hoy en día tienen los convivientes. Entonces eso ganaría que sabía que transversalizar en toda la legislación toda la mención que se haga a conviviente debería ser automáticamente aplicable a las personas unidas en unión civil porque se trata de un régimen espejo y nosotros creemos que esa es la principal ventaja porque garantiza quizás no de modo absoluto pero por lo menos de modo importante la garantía de igualdad. Eso resolvería, digamos, la primera inquietud plantada. Muchas gracias.","Beatriz, Maylin, Ramírez, representative of Promsex. I will start by referring to the project of the shared marriage. The advantage of this shared marriage is that, as I said, the Congresswoman Ciceta is an opening to access to credit beyond what we know today as the society of profits, which is the autonomous marriage that can only form exclusively a person in relation to a couple, whether in the marriage plan or in the living plan. But what about other family models that the constitutional court has recognized that they deserve a promotion? What happens with a mother like mine who doesn't have a husband, who has a daughter at a working age, who earns a salary, a mother who earns a salary, we both rent a property and we rent the salary of her, it is not possible to qualify a bank loan exclusively, my salary, we have to confess it, it is not possible to qualify a bank loan either, but if there was a legal mechanism that would allow us to consolidate a marriage, we would do both and we would stop renting it, she would accept it, We are talking about the policies that the government has, as my own living roof. That legal void that allows other types of family groups, beyond the couples, that are in relation to marriage or coexistence, those who enter into the social financial system of autonomous marriage by excellence, that legal void, that need to attend to that population is the one that supports the project of shared marriage. This is not a project, and that must be understood by everyone and everyone interested in the subject matter. It is not a project referring to the transsexual, lesbian, bisexual and gay community. It is not. They can be beneficiaries, but as any other citizen can be. The Congresswoman Asiatta mentions the statistics that the National Institute of Informatic Statistics votes. According to the UN of 2009, 23.8% of families in our country are monoparent families led by women. that are families that deserve legal protection. The Constitutional Court has a sentence on the need to protect other types of families beyond the nuclear family because they are a reality, they are a political, an existence, but they still need public policies and legislation that allow them to access levels of well-being. At that level, the project of shared marriage would allow two or more people without a family relationship between them, without any kind of link necessarily for them We have to recognize that a union of couples is not made for that. It is simply one. A contract that allows you to form an autonomous heritage that no one can form today. Today, who can go to the bank to believe in joint income to pass a joint credit evaluation? Only the conjugees, only the living ones. As an institution, we consider that it is limited. There are other types of people who, in the framework of their family relationships, but even outside of this, can consider necessary to access the credit. The housing is one of the great policies of the state today, access to housing, and unfortunately we have legal vacancies that do not allow people to access that level of well-being. It is at that measure that we consider, talking about the project of shared heritage, that must receive a favorable dictation, because it benefits a wide sector of the population, which is mainly referred to monoparent families, mainly led by women, But it also allows other groups of people to access credit. Among them, there is a homosexual couple who can access credit, but as they can do it with their child or with their daughter, as they can do it with two sisters, as they can do it with anyone. Take into account that the basic salary in our country does not reach 600 soles. And the credit rate barrier is 1500, everyone knows it. You need at least 1500 soles to pass a credit rate, and that some bank of the known accesses if you want to qualify your student. So if you take into account that, the advantage of the shared heritage project is that it does not reduce the group between two, but considers a group that can be of three people, three people with minimum salary, three sisters who share a house in Alquiler and raise their children together, which is not usually our reality, they could access and there surely are the sounds that we have made and those of us who know our own realities very close, many interested women, to impact this type of autonomous marriage that allows them to reach levels of well-being. I would like to take advantage of the minutes left to talk about the Civil Union project, which we also have a favorite opinion and I will please explain why. In the right, in general, there are two institutions that recognize the affective unions between people. They are marriage and coexistence. In our country, there has been a lot of fighting, So that in 1979 the coexistence is recognized as a family, of the same category and that it deserves the same protection that a matrimonial family deserves. In that measure we have two legal institutions, on which, in our country, there is a heterosexual definition, it has to be between a man and a woman, and we have homosexual couples that have no kind of recognition. We have the matrimony regime and the coexistence regime. What does the LAI project present by the Congress The draft law 4181 does not seek to equalize the issue of marriage, it does not say where to give that debate, but rather says, well, of these two legal institutions, marriage and coexistence, let the recognition of homosexual people be the regime of coexistence, as such. If one reviews Article 4, which for us is the main strength of this draft law, the draft law defines that civil unions will have the same rights and and that leads us to the fact that everybody knows that today we have the living ones in this country, the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right There was a package of rights that were associated with the coexistence that is recognized as a family, but that in our constitution is defined in heterosexual key. As the congressman Roland Osoza said, Article 5 of our constitution says that the union of facts is the union between a man and a woman. In that measure, the planteamiento of the congressman Vargas, who we as an institution support and a broad network of organizations that the IGB supports, is to say, well, I can't call it a union of facts, So let's do what Congress says, we adapt the Civil Union Regiment, which in the Comparado right has a diverse content, and let's make the Civil Union in Peru, to approve this norm, be it a civil union, a mirror regime of which the heterosexual living unions have, defined heterosexual in our constitution. We can discuss whether or not that should be the case, but it is really like that. So what the Law Project proposes is a civil union defined as a mirror regime of which the of what today has the residents. So that would make it possible to cross the legislation, all the mention that is made to the resident should be automatically applicable to the people united in the civil union because it is a mirror regime and we believe that is the main advantage because it guarantees perhaps not absolute fashion but at least importantly the guarantee of equality. That would solve the first thing you thought. Thank you very much."

I've got it's actually right I think just tell them what it is flock exists to deliver solutions to the 1 billion people who are mobile workers in this world We're living in such incredible times right now because technology is giving us the freedom to work where we want and how we want So gone are the days where we're stuck to our office desk having to work nine to five Yeah, I mean it is absolutely amazing But there's been a couple of snacks associated with mobile working and that's what flock is gonna sweep We've created a sophisticated digital solution that can be used in any city that you find yourself in to help you find the best coffee shop or workplace to go based on your specific needs. We're also going to help you arrange meetings in a matter of minutes and give you discounts to products and services that you can use to help you find the best coffee shop or workplace to go based on your specific needs. Also, we're going to create a community of flockers that are open to collaboration and helping each other out. So in a basic nutshell, ThinkFourSquare meets GroupBond meets co-working spaces, but better. Where do we even come up with it for? Well, Clara, you and I were working for Richard Brinton's corporate foundation and then I think we were out for a drink one night and we talked about our previous careers. You were telling me about how you set up a fashion company and I was telling you how I set up a built environment and consultancy and it was probably only about two weeks late. I came to Clara and I said I'm dying to start another business and the entrepreneur that Clara is. I was like, yeah, yeah, me too. So like any sensible entrepreneur, we went straight to the office stationery counter, grab as much eight, three papers and markers. Whatever we could do. Headed straight to the cafe to do some brainstorming. So then we kind of like spewed up all the ideas that are floating around in our brains or living on the note section of our iPhones and you know bit of to and fro and then we hit upon this concept the wish list Yeah, it was an idea that for how to make joint purchase decisions easier for people and we mapped it all out We have a visual business model. Yeah, and it was it was actually pretty fun It was cool, but it was it was a little bit solutions or yeah something about it just it didn't feel right to us and we understood that given that we've run and built businesses before that It's very important to be motivated by much bigger vision. Yeah so we started thinking okay what is our bigger vision or at least what's the stuff that we're really really passionate about and we realized what we know you're passionate about is efficiencies. It's a bit nerdy but and about like how we can liberate people to really add values to the world so we took all the post-it notes off the wall and we said okay let's figure this out let's start thinking about the solutions for mobile workers. We are so excited about this Vera with the solutions that we have in mind including what we've described and additional ones about combining the business models of something like Airbnb in Zipcar, there's so many amazing solutions to help us deliver this much bigger vision. And in 2015, there's going to be 1.3 billion mobile workers who are going to need unique solutions. So, Telefonica, you have the technology to power the mobile worker revolution, but working together, we can really lead the flock.","Hey, we're so this incredibly sick production is so we can talk to you about flock which by the way We think is pretty flocking cool flock right it is. I've got it's actually All right, just tell them what it is flock exists to deliver solutions to the 1 billion people who are mobile workers in this world We're living in such incredible times right now because technology is giving us the freedom to work where we want and how we want So gone are the days where we're stuck to our office desk having to work nine to five Yeah, I mean it is absolutely amazing But there's been a couple of snacks associated with mobile working and that's what flock is gonna sweep We've created a sophisticated digital solution that can be used in any city that you find yourself in to help you find the best coffee shop or workplace to go based on your specific needs. We're also going to help you arrange meetings in a matter of minutes and give you discounts to products and services that you can use to help you find the best coffee shop or workplace to go based on your specific needs.

We're also going to help you arrange meetings in a Also, we're going to create a community of flockers that are open to collaboration and helping each other out. So in a basic nutshell, ThinkFourSquare meets GroupBond meets co-working spaces, but better. Much better. I mean like, flock triangulates. Basically, technology is moving really quickly and it's creating a disconnect with our city. Some people are trying to deal with this but they're not coming at it from the right angle because they're trying to solve it with technology. This isn't just a technological fix. It's about people, it's about behaviour and it's about cities. Oh my god, I completely love this project. I completely love this idea. Where do we even come up with it from? Well, Clara, you and I were working for Richard Brinton's corporate foundation and then I think we were out for a drink one night and we talked about our previous careers. You were telling me about how you set up a fashion company and I was telling you how I set up a built environment and consultancy and it was probably only about two weeks late. I came to Clara and I said I'm dying to start another business and the entrepreneur that Clara is. I was like, yeah, yeah, me too. So like any sensible entrepreneur, we went straight to the office stationery counter, grab as much eight, three papers and markers. Whatever we could do. Headed straight to the cafe to do some brainstorming. So then we kind of like spewed up all the ideas that are floating around in our brains or living on the note section of our iPhones and you know bit of to and fro and then we hit upon this concept the wish list Yeah, it was an idea that for how to make joint purchase decisions easier for people and we mapped it all out We have a visual business model. Yeah, and it was it was actually pretty fun It was cool, but it was it was a little bit solutions or yeah something about it just it didn't feel right to us and we understood that given that we've run and built businesses before that It's very important to be motivated by much bigger vision. Yeah so we started thinking okay what is our bigger vision or at least what's the stuff that we're really really passionate about and we realized what we know you're passionate about is efficiencies. It's a bit nerdy but and about like how we can liberate people to really add values to the world so we took all the post-it notes off the wall and we said okay let's figure this out let's start thinking about the solutions for mobile workers.

And in 2015, there's going to be 1.3 billion mobile workers who are going to need unique solutions. So, Telefonica, you have the technology to power this mobile, the mobile worker revolution, but working together, we can really lead the flock."

Namelijk Schra en Jeroen. Ik begin bij Schra. Schra, genoten? Geweldig. Ik zei zojuist dat ik een van de juren leden... volgens mij is het één van de meest geslaagde edities die er geweest zijn. Alles liep perfect tot... Nou, tevreden gezichten, prachtig muziek gemaakt, heel afwisselend. Ja, precies de doelstelling van het eurofest wel. Ik word naar de Oort Innovatief Fijn. Waar zie je nog meer mogelijkheden? Waar kan dit naartoe gaan? en meer iets meer cultureel meekrijgen uit het Limburgse of uit het Nederlandse. En op die manier, ja, en daar moeten we eigenlijk nog een beetje harder behoeven nadenken van hoe we dat in kunnen kleden en wat voor mogelijkheden hebben. Dus we zullen met verschillende organisaties moeten overleggen en praten of andere organisaties daar interesse in hebben. En misschien dat we dat op kunnen pikken. Innovativiteit, een belangrijk begrip op dit moment. Ik ga heel even switchen naar de zoon, want die heeft daar ook een heel belang. Wat heb je er allemaal voor elkaar gekregen? We hebben tien medewerkers die volduurend bezig zijn met de belichting, het geluid en de video met het internet gebeuren zelf. Daar zit ontzettend veel werk en mankracht achter. Er is zeker geen invoudige opgave, maar ik denk dat we dat toch heel mooi klaar gespeeld hebben. Ook daar zie je nog mogelijkheden. Ik heb het nu op het culturele gebied, daar heb ik het gehoord. We gaan misschien wat meer internationaliseren. Maar ook technisch. Volgens mij zet er nog heel veel in je hoofd. Ja, absoluut. En dat ga ik absoluut nog niet verklappen, maar we hebben wel weer hele leuke ideeën voor de komende jaren. En ja, ik word dus net de dirigent remoor Lodder zal zeggen van ik heb vrienden in Corea en in Sydney zitten die meelijk kijken nu op dit moment. Nou, dat geeft gewoon aan. Dat is exact waarom dat we jaren geleden eigenlijk zijn begonnen met radiouitzendingen toen tot tijd op het internet. En dat is exact de reden waarom dat we dit eigenlijk doen. Er zijn gewoon mensen die niet kunnen komen eigenlijk. Dus we zijn eigenlijk ook helemaal niet zo bang dat mensen naar internet gaan kijken en niet naar Ik zie een lach in die roende, dus ik ga ervan uit dat dit antwoord klopt. Volgende keer.","Ladies and gentlemen, we have two very important people in this organisation. The Hermans family. Sra and Jeroen. I'm starting with Sra. Sra, are you enjoying it? Great. I just said that one of the judges, I think, is one of the most successful editions that have been there. Everything went perfectly. To a happy face, beautiful music made, very exciting. Exactly the setting of the Eurofest. We need to think about how we can put that in and what possibilities we have. We will have to discuss and talk with different organisations. Maybe we can pick that up. Innovativity, an important concept at the moment. I'm going to switch to the son, because he has an important role. Jeroen, can you tell us how you got it all together? I also wonder that, because it has been a huge plus in the past weeks to put the points on the I. We switched from equipment technology in the beginning of this week, because we thought it wasn't stable enough. And how we got it ready, just a lot of equipment. We have more than 25,000 watts of equipment here. We have ten employees who are constantly working on the lighting, the sound, the video, the internet. There is a lot of work and manpower behind it. It is certainly not a difficult task, but I think we have played it very well. You can still see octasis there. I have heard it in the cultural area now. We will maybe internationalize it a little more. But also technically, according to me, there are still a lot of your heads. Absolutely, and I'm not going to lie, but we have very nice ideas for the coming years. I heard the director, Mor Lodder, say that his friends in Korea and in Sydney are watching the media. That's exactly why we started radio broadcasts years ago on the internet. That's exactly why we do this. People can't come. We're not afraid that people will watch the internet. I see a smile in the face, so I assume this is the right answer. Ladies and gentlemen, you have seen two enthusiastic, popular people who are very important pillars for this organization. Also from here, from Maasbrach, maybe looking at it in Korea or Sydney, thank you for the follow-up of this beautiful festival. See you next time."

The band has been openly granted as the FIRST EVER Grindcore band from Finland. Originally named as Repulse, the band recorded their first demo ""On a Cartrip to Sweden"" in 1987. The Band was later named Xysma and under their new name, they released their legendary second demo ""Swarming of the Maggots"" in 1989. In 1990 they got signed to Comeback record company and they released their first EP ""Above the Mind of Morbidity"" in the same year. By then, Xysma had had more Death Metal influences to their music and the grindcore blasts decreased and the speed slowed down. Later that year they released a 7-inch ""Fata Morgana"" through American Seraphic Decay label. 1991 ,Xysma recorded their first full-length ""Yeah"", which was released by the old ComeBack label and recorded in the famous Swedish Sunlight Studios in Stockholm. This album introduced a original mix of Heavy/Death metal/psychedelic rock riffs in the vein of Black Sabbath and occasional Grindcore blasting. Therefore, Xysma can be considered the ACTUAL PIONEER OF DEATH 'N' ROLL, a style , which was later familiarized by Entombed in their 1993 ""Wolverine Blues"" album. Their second album ""The First and Magical""'93 continued loosely the same musical paths as their former album, but now with less Grindcore and Death Metal influences. The name of their second album was sort of a sign of their major changes to be come. the third full-length, 1994's ""Deluxe"",showed the last signs of Grindcore blasts and Death 'n' Roll. ""Lotto"" of 1996 presented Xysma's whole new style, Retro-rock. The old days had been left behind for good. After their last album ""Girl on the Beach"" of 1998 the band split-up.   When the ex-guitarist Toni Stranius ( who also played in Disgrace before his carreer in Xysma ) died in 2006, Xysma did a final reunion gig for the memory of their late guitarist.    R.I.P Toni Stranius    This is the opening track of their second full-length ""The First and Magical"" of 1993","Grindcore, Death, Convulse, Disgrace, Xysma, Amorphis, Sabbath, Entombed, Black, Finland, Sentenced, Metal, Finnish, Roll",31191,179,15,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/I8Gt-ibBmsQ.mp3,Channel check.

I thought that I would do a real quick and concise little tutorial on how to do onion skin dye Easter AIDS. I saw Takamon Asuri's video response about Easter traditions and when I was growing up we didn't do the onion skin dye although my mother's mother did. So I brought it back last year after having seen some photographs on Flickr of a contact of mine who's Lithuania and the way they did them which I thought had a real interesting twist to them. So what you will need is obviously a pot. We'll need some white eggs because brown eggs won't do you much good with tea-toned Easter eggs. And then you'll need onion skin. I I actually picked this out of the bin at my produce market last week about two onions in a bag full of onionskin. And that's why I'm not going through the process right now of showing you because I have to save my onionskin. Hopefully I'll get some more before next weekend. So you'll need as much onionskin as you can get for your pot, your eggs. Now this is where the interesting part comes in. You can just do with that. You can layer your eggs with the onionskin. some onion skin on the bottom of your pot, put some eggs, put some onion skins on top, and then cover the whole thing with water so it just comes up over to the top. Put a few tablespoons of vinegar in there and I saw one place online that said to you also use salt but the eggs are in the shell, maybe the salt helps with the setting of the color, I don't know. And I will show you at the end of this video, I'll have a few stills of my eggs from last year because I'm not going to do them yet because I have to save my onion skin. But what the difference with the way these eggs are done is that you can actually take botanical material. Last year I used mugwort and I used birch leaves. But this year I'm also thinking I may use some fennel, I have some, I think this is fever-few, it's either fever-few or just medicinal prasandum. I have that and I also have these sweet little, it's a ground cover we have on the side of our house. But what you do with that, I will show you. So basically what you do is that you take a piece of cheesecloth, like so and then You'll have your egg, but let's say I'm going to use the chrysanthemum flowers and leaves so you can kind of take them and stick them down how you might want to wrap them around your egg and then you'll take your egg and You're going to just But anyway, I'll punch it up here so just so you can see you'll wrap it around the egg Like so so that you have this this cute little package I'm doing this kind of sloppily just because I don't want to make the video too long but So you wrap that up tight and you can get more obviously I don't have enough in here I would put more in so you wrap it up like that and then you can just take some twine and just tie it on the edges You want to get it as tight as you can because obviously the tighter you get the material to be against the egg the more of an imprint that you'll have. Then you would just have your pot obviously. It's just with the onion skins in there and then you just set your eggs and then you boil them all together. And that's it. Now you'll need the eggs to boil a little bit longer than you would normally do hard boiled eggs because you need the color to come. I don't remember. I was checking out websites. I may have bookmarked one. I didn't look. But this website said to boil them for 10 to 15 minutes which sounds about right. I don't believe. I don't remember whether I boiled the onion skins a little bit first to get the color to come. I don't think I did. I think you just boiled them all together. The color is really an amazing red. It's really, really beautiful and deep and rich. When you get the imprints of the botanical material as well, it's just really beautiful. I saw another one another site that actually had you wrap the leaves, the onion skin, I'm sorry, the onion skin right around it plus extra onion skin and those made really quite a beautiful kind of marble patterns as well. There is an instruction to just put a light coating of oil over them afterwards to make them kind of shiny. But I tried that last year and it was kind of new. I can't see it really. Well maybe it might help a little bit. You can try it and see. I mean my MO when working with any kind of creative project is just to experiment. You're not going to, you know, there's no mess ups. There's just learning experiences. But give it a try. It's a lot of fun and I'm going to put some still pictures below so you can see how my eggs turned out from last year and we'll see you soon.","Hi everyone, I thought that I would do a real quick and concise little tutorial on how to do onion skin dye Easter AIDS.

So basically what you do is that you take a piece of cheesecloth and you put it on the top of the like so and then You'll have your egg, but let's say I'm going to use the chrysanthemum flowers and leaves so you can kind of take them and stick them down how you might want to wrap them around your egg so just Go in here and there and then you'll take your egg and You're going to just it's probably a little longer But anyway, I'll punch it up here so just so you can see you'll wrap it around the egg Like so so that you have this this cute little package I'm doing this kind of sloppily just because I don't want to make the video too long But so you wrap that up tight and you can get more obviously I don't have enough in here I would put more in so you wrap it up like that and then you can just take some twine and Just tie it on the edges You want to get it as tight as you can because obviously the tighter you get the material to be against the egg the more of an imprint that you'll have. Then you would just have your pot obviously. It's just with the onion skins in there and then you just set your eggs and then you boil them all together. And that's it. Now you'll need the eggs to boil a little bit longer than you would normally do hard boiled eggs because you need the color to come. I don't remember, I was checking out websites, I didn't, I may have bookmarked one, I didn't look. But this website said to boil them for 10 to 15 minutes, which sounds about right. I don't believe, I can't believe I don't remember whether I boiled the onion skins a little bit first to get the color to come. I don't think I did. I think you just boiled them all together. The color is really an amazing red. It's really, really beautiful and deep and rich. When you get the imprints of the botanical material as well, it's just really beautiful. another site that actually had you wrap the leaves, the onion skin, I'm sorry, the onion skin right around it, plus extra onion skin and those made really quite a beautiful kind of marble patterns as well. There is an instruction to just put a light coating of oil over them afterwards to make them kind of shiny. But I tried that last year and it was kind of new. I from last year and we'll see you soon."

Hoy vamos a hablar de la kashrut, la dieta de los judíos. Pasando por Barcelona con mi pinta inconfundible de judío, con barba larga, cabeza cubierta y con los flecos del citiz que cuelgan de mi ropa, si me acercan dos jóvenes con una pregunta en hebreo. ¿Dónde hay un restaurante kosher? Bueno, yo debo explicar que si bien yo tenía pinta de judía a presumo de ella, aquellos dos jóvenes no la tenían. Pero de todos modos se molestaron mucho al saber que no hay ningún restaurante kosher en Barcelona, ¿cómo es posible? Como si fuera lo más normal del mundo que hubiera comida kosher en cualquier rincón del globo. Y la verdad es que para los judíos israelíes, lo más normal del mundo es consumir comida kosher. ¿Claro? Lo cual significa que la vida judiana en el estado de Israel, después de casi dos mil años de terrible paréntesis, está volviendo a su normalidad. Uno de los símbolos más claros de esta dieta de comida kosher es la prohidracía de comer la carne del cerdo. Ya se sabe, los judíos no comen carne de cerdo. Hasta el punto que la mayor ofensa que puede hacerse a un judío es obligarlo a comer la carne de este animal. Y esto lo han sabido los antisemitas durante más de dos mil años. Y les han puesto a los judíos apodos peyorativos relacionados con el cerdo, como podría ser el nombre de Marranos, a los judíos conversos de España, o la mala intención con que apodos cuando dice la mila en Mallorca hace unos 35 años el cura del cuartel que era uno de los pocos que se ve que es el judío me preguntó en presencia de otros soldados si se vea que los judíos no comen carne de cerdo yo le dije ay por qué me dijo por qué así está escrito en la biblia entonces yo le dije ah no comen cerdo por qué así está escrito en la biblia pues me parece muy bien los soldados presentes son y me dieron la razón. La verdad es que la lista de las comidas prohibidas es muy larga e incluye manjares que en otros pueblos son considerados como delicados y suculentos, como pueden ser los crustáceos, los calamares, las anguilas. Únicamente los animales marítimos que tengan escamas y aletas están permitidos. Un detalle muy importante por cierto es el de los insectos. Tanto los voladores como los terrestres y los acuáticos, todos están prohibidos de comerlos. Por pequeños que sean, Mientras el ojo humano en buena salud sea capaz de verlos, está prohibido comerlos. Los que ya son tan pequeños que no pueden verse están fuera de la prohibición de la tora, ya que la tora no fue entregada únicamente a aquellos que tienen microscopio, sino a personas, normales y serias. Hay muchas verduras que están plagadas de insecto y es necesario limpiar conciencia de las verduras antes de comerlas para estar seguro que no queda ningún insecto. En la tora hay una lista de aves prohibidas. La mayoría de ellas son aves de presa que de todos modos no suelen estar incluidas en nuestro menú. Pero tanto los pollos, los pavos, incluso los patos, codornices y los tordos, todos estos están perfectamente permitíbulos. Y de los animales terrestres, los que sean rumiantes y tengan la pezuña partida, que son 10 especies según la Torah, pero como que muchas veces podemos ver en cada especie que hay razas diferentes, como puede verse entre los perros que nada se parece un perro San Bernardo a Onchihuahua, pues lo mismo puede ocurrir en los mamíferos estos de pezuña partida, que siendo de una misma especie puede darse el caso en que se parezca un poco. Pero es fácil reconocerlos, nos basta con estas dos señales, que son rumiantes y que tienen la pezuña partida para decidir si pueden consumirse o no, pero no basta con saber qué animal está permitido, sino que es necesario de gollar lo correctamente y luego desangrarlo con un tratamiento de sal de una hora más o menos. Este es un verdadero problema ya que en realidad la sangre está prohibida tanto a los judíos como a los de otros pueblos. Pero poca gente hay que se cuide de desangrar adecuadamente la carne antes de consumirla. La verdad es que la sangre es uno de los ingredientes más saludables del animal, hasta el punto que la tora misma dice que la sangre es la vida. O sea que la vida del animal depende de la circulación de la sangre, que tiene por misión repartir a los miembros del cuerpo, todas las proteínas, las vitaminas, las alas, etc. Hay pueblos primitivos que tienen ritos especiales de beber la sangre de los animales, aún sin matarlos, y aquelos proporcionan una gran energía. Y precisamente a causa de todas estas cualidades, la sangre era la principal ofrenda de los sacrificios en nuestro templo de Jerusalén. Y por eso mismo, nos está prohibido para ello hay dos posibilidades, o salar la sangre, la carne perdón con sal gruesa hasta que quede completamente desangrada o asarla al fuego dejando que el fuego absorba la sangre no es necesario quemar la sangre sino quemasta con asarla normalmente y es suficiente pero no puede consumirse en el estado en que los chefs de franceses llaman sañón o sea sangrante de y otro para leche, adecuadamente señalados para que no se confundan. Pero no basta con todo esto, durante una semana al año está prohibido comer levadura y todos sus derivados, durante la celebración de Pesach, la Pascoajudía. La casa debe estar completamente libre de levadura y de cualquier tipo de pasta que la contenga, y es necesario usar una batería de cocina que esté estirilizada de levadura. normal después de pasar un duro tratamiento, como si es una batería especial para pesaj. Los judíos asquianazitas y algunas comunidades sefarditas añaden a esta prohibición de la levadura, también la abstención de comer legumbres. Junto con la obligación de comer pan ácimo la matzá, convierte la dieta judía en una empresa verdaderamente espectacular. Ah, casi me había olvidado. Hay otro tipo de prohibiciones de comida que se basan en la diferenciación entre las comunidades judías y las que no lo son. Quiero decir que la torano se obliga a guardar una distancia determinada de otras culturas para evitar hacer migas con ellas y que al final nos harán sufrir influencias negativas. Esta diferenciación está presente en tres o cuatro elementos que fueron decretados a 100 milenios como prohibidos en caso de procesar de los no judíos. que estén hechos fabricados de una forma completamente casero. Pero si provienen de ellos, está prohibido. Se tranta del vino, la leche, el queso y a lo más condiciones también el pan. Todo esto nos obliga a buscar productos que estén supervisados por personas competentes para poder cumplir correctamente con esta dura dieta judía. La humanidad se rinde a la realidad de que el cuerpo es el que nos dicta sus caprichos y nos vemos obligados a cumplir los arraja tabla. Pero los judíos no nos rendimos tan fácilmente. Tenemos una dieta que nos permite regular el consumo de nuestros alimentos, según un sistema de ideales y de principios. Las normas dietéticas del judaísmo nos abren el camino a un dominio de nuestro cuerpo. El espíritu es el que da las órdenes, y el cuerpo es el que debe cumplirlas, para no convertirse en un ente egoísta y desenfrenado. Shalom.","Shalom! Today we are going to talk about the kashrut, the diet of the Jews. to know that there is no restaurant kosher in Barcelona? How is it possible? As if it were the most normal thing in the world that there was kosher food in any corner of the globe. And the truth is that for Jewish Israelis the most normal thing in the world is to consume kosher food. Of course. Which means that Jewish life in the state of Israel after almost 2,000 years of terrible parenthesis is becoming its normality. One of the most clear symbols of this diet of kosher food is probably the prohibition of eating the meat of the pig. It is already known that Jews do not eat pig meat. To this point, the biggest offense that a Jew can do is force him to eat the meat of this animal. And this has been known to the antisemites for more than 2,000 years. And they have put the Jewish people in more active positions related to the pig, as it could be the name of the Marranos, to the Jewish converts of Spain, or the bad intention They put the conversation in the greater K with the Shoepoth. When Amil in the greater K says about 35 years ago, the priest of the quarter, who was one of the few who knew that I am Jewish, asked me in the presence of other soldiers if he knew that the Jews do not eat pork meat. I said, oh, why? He said, because it is written in the Bible. Then I said, ah, do not eat pork because it is written in the Bible? Well, I think it's very good. they did not give me the reason. The truth is that the list of forbidden foods is very long and includes manjaros that in other towns are considered as delicate and succulent, such as crustaceans, squid, anguillas. Only the sea animals that have skin and fins are allowed. A very important detail, by the way, is the insects. Both the flyers and the land and the aquatic, they are all forbidden to eat them. As small as they are, While the human eye in good health is able to see them, it is forbidden to eat them. Those who are already so small that they cannot see themselves are out of the prohibition of the Torah, and since the Torah was not delivered only to those who have a microscope, but to people, normal and serious. There are many vegetables that are plagued by insects and it is necessary to clean the vegetables before eating them, to be sure that there are no insects left. of forbidden birds. Most of them are prey birds that, in any case, are not included in our menu. But both the chickens, the birds, even the ducks, the cubs and the turtles, all of these are perfectly permittive. And of the terrestrial animals, those who are Romanian and have the belly of a game, which are 10 species according to the Torah, but as many times we can see in each species that there are different races, as can be seen between the dogs that don't seem to be a San Bernardo Chihuahua, it can happen in the mamifers of the Pesuña Partida, which being of the same species, can be the case in which they look a little. But it's easy to recognize them. It's not enough with these two signs, which are Romanian and which have the Pesuña Partida, to decide if they can be consumed or not. But it's not enough to know what animal is allowed. It's not necessary to swallow and then bleed it with a salt treatment of about an hour. This is a real problem, since in reality the blood is forbidden both to Jews and other peoples. But few people care about bleeding the flesh before consuming it. The truth is that the blood is one of the most healthy ingredients of the animal, to the point that the doctor himself says that the blood is life. That is, that the life of an animal depends on the blood of the animal. depends on the circulation of blood, which has permission to distribute the body, all the protein, vitamins, salts, etc. There are primitive peoples who have special rites to drink the blood of animals, even without killing them, and that provides them with great energy. And precisely because of all these qualities, the blood was the main offering of the sacrifices in our temple of Jerusalem. And for that very reason, There are two possibilities for this. Salting the blood with coarse salt until it is completely blooded or burning it to the fire, letting the fire absorb the blood. It is not necessary to burn the blood, but burn it normally and it is enough. But it cannot be consumed in the state in which French chefs call it saignant, that is, sangrante. Some of them are seasoned with chorizo, which have blood as the main ingredient, can not enter our diet. After eating the meat allowed, the Jew will still have to wait several hours, three or six, according to the usual differences, before being able to consume dairy foods, to avoid eating meat with milk. For this, normally we have different kitchen batteries and food storage services, and other for milk, adequately marked so that they do not get confused. But this is not enough. During a week a year, it is forbidden to eat yeast and all its derivatives during the celebration of Pesach, the Easter day. The house must be completely free of yeast and any type of paste that contains it. And it is necessary to use a kitchen battery that is sterilized with yeast. after having a hard treatment, as if it were a special battery for weight. The Jewish Kenazites and some Sephardic communities add to this prohibition of raising the abstention of eating lebumbris. Along with the obligation to eat Pan-Azim or Lama-Tsa, the Jewish diet becomes a truly spectacular company. Ah, I almost forgot. There are other types of prohibitions, of food that are based on the differentiation between the Jewish communities and those who are not. I mean that the Toran forces to keep a certain distance from other cultures to avoid making megas with them, and that in the end they will not suffer negative influences. This differentiation is present in three or four elements that were decreed to be millennia as prohibited in the case of the process of the non-Jews, are made in a completely casual way. But if they come from them, it is forbidden. They are made of wine, milk, cheese and in the same conditions also bread. All this forces us to look for products that are supervised by competent professors to be able to perform correctly with this hard Jewish diet. Humanity is given to the reality that the body is the one who dictates its capriciousness and we are forced to perform the Rajatabla. But the Jews do not give up so easily. We have a diet that allows us to regulate the consumption of our food according to a system of ideals and principles. The diet norms of Judaism open us the way to a domain of our body. The spirit is the one that gives orders, and the body is the one that must fulfill them, so as not to become an egoistic and unbridled entity. Shalom."

You also want to choose one side and remove all the hardware like D-rings or maybe the waist belt buckle so that you can use that webbing to weave. I like to keep the hardware complete on one side so then I can copy how to put those D-rings back on. And if you're selective about where to put it, just put a little chalk mark. Now the first thing we're going to do is the 32 pound pockets go on vertically. So go ahead and remove your waist belt webbing from your hip pad, turn your pocket over and weave that waist belt webbing through the first slot on the back of the pocket. So that's how our pocket will lay. Now we also have a side plate. And I went ahead and removed mine. This is the shoulder strap side plate. It makes it easier to work with. Go ahead and take the side plate With the angle facing forward, you want to go up through the first slot and then down through the second one. And that's actually going to lock that side plate in between the two pieces of webbing on the back of the pocket. Go ahead and slide your waist belt webbing back through the second piece of webbing on the back of the pocket. Your side plate's secure and now your pocket is secure. Reattach your shoulder. Put any hardware back on and you're good to go.","Hi, today I'm going to show you how to attach the 32 pound QB weight pockets to a Transpak harness.

As meninas, de 8 e 6 anos, presenciavam o pai se masturbando, mantendo relações com a irmã e ainda eram acariciadas por ele. Mesmo com todas as provas, o homem nega que tenha cometido os abusos.

Ela, supostamente, ter comentado, eu não sei dizer senhora.

Even with all the evidence, the man denies that he had committed the abuses. And why did your daughter have comments at school with one of the teachers or with a director that she would be passing through some kind of sexual abuse inside the house? She supposedly commented, I don't know how to say it, but if I say it like this, the majority of the things she said in her document, she was led by someone else, because things my daughter said, I thought more about saying something, she said very intelligent things, and things that I'm absurd about, that I never thought about saying, So, most of the things she said were told, was told to say. My only mistake was to have bathed her. I don't know why, but I didn't give a bath. She taught her to do her personal hygiene. That was my mistake."

And the next one I want to show you is Hugh Jackman, a very good singer. Russell Crowe, again, a very solid singer. Anna Halfway does a very good fontina. They did a really good job picking people for these songs. Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe really do a fantastic job since they're the two main characters carrying the bulk of this movie. Sasha Barat-Cohen and Helena Bottom Carter do an excellent job as the endkeeper. So one jacket is the plot of this movie. When it begins, John Valjean is finally somewhat released from prison, but he will be on indefinite parole, and his papers most have him written down as a dangerous individual, so he really can't find work anywhere.

But Javert, who essentially is, you can see how In the beginning he's just overseeing the slaves and the prisoners and then every time you see him later and later in the movie He's got a more and more octagon uniform.

So you've always got that interplay between Jean Baljean and Javert, which is really strong. So you've got two really strong main characters, as well as everything else going on with, you know, the end of the French Revolution going back into a uptake on the French Revolution, it does have a really nice, epic feel to it. So if you haven't enjoyed the musical, this is pretty much the exact same thing, just done with a slightly grander scope, because it ends up being easier to do these things on a large screen than to try and do them in a theater setting.","The 2012 version of Les Mis on the big screen.

Aus dem Auto und Will Salon in Gämpf. Wir sind in der fettesten, dicksten, dürsten und geilsten Kerne auf der Spur. Jetzt kommen wir zu den absoluten, ohne bezwungenen Top 3. Darüber liegt der schnittige Schlitten Made in Britain. Der Aston Martin, DBS, Volante für ungerechnet 271.420 Franken. Die Pirsche nach den Top 3 der edelsten Gefährten geht weiter und auf das Siegertreppchen hat es erneut ein Engländer geschafft. Ladies and Gentlemen, der Rolls-Royce auf Platz 3. Nicht nur die Queen weiß die traditionelle Exquisität zu schätzen. Der Phantom Drophead-Coupé mit einer Länge von 5,60 m ist eine Faszination auf Rädern. Das ist nur ein V12-Zylindermotor, der fährt 250 km, aber wenn Sie einmal drin sitzen, ich glaube nicht, dass Sie es wirklich ausreizen wollen. Wenn in einem Rolls-Royce geht es natürlich darum, das Fahren zu genießen, die Ruhe zu genießen und auch die Zeit zu genießen, die man sich nimmt, um mit einem solchen Auto dann unterwegs zu sein. Alles Handarbeit inklusive Feinster-Leder und Hölzer. Und das hat natürlich seinen Preis. Für stolze 600.000 Franken vorsteuigende Die Highlights von unserem Stamm sind erstens ein bisschen blödsam. Das ist das Jubiläumsauto zu der 100 Jahre Bugatti, wo man das aufhört. Das Auto, das ich drinsitze, ist der Bugatti Grand Sport. Das ist der Roadster, wo man jetzt im März anfangen produzieren, in einer Strucksaal von 150 Einheiten. die nun in diesen schicken, aber kostspieligen Sportboliden verliebt hat, muss tief in die Tasche greifen. Der normale Veyron, der Zweiteuerung, Audio-Office-Tage ist 1,2 Mio. Euro. Vor Steuern kommt 1,4 Mio. Folgende Besonderheiten bietet der Supersportwagen. Der Veyron hat einen 16-Zündig-Motor mit 1000 HP. Es hat die Schwitzgeschwindigkeit von knapp über 400 km. Wir beschleunigen von 0 auf 100 km, mit 2,5 Sekunden. Interessant ist, dass man von 100 auf 0 zu 2,3 bremsen kann. Man bremsen in einer kürzeren Zeit, damit man beschleunigt. Luxuslimousinen oder schnelle Sportflitzer. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hier nicht auf Pferdestärke, sondern Umweltverträglichkeit. Der Wagenmaid in Espanya macht es vor. Neben den PS-Krachen von Bugatti, von Aston Martin, zu Lamborghini, würde ich mich trotz allem mit meinem bescheiden Budget für ein Seat entscheiden, das ein super Fahrzeug hat mit 98 Gramm CO2-Ausstoß, das der ökonomischste ist, der Seat ihre ganze Entwicklung im Motorschbereich optimal umsetzt und den Motor herrscht. jetzt war ich die Zähnsfunk zu überbüten. Dieser Wagen schafft es bei uns auf den Thron der Beliebtheitsskala. Denn mit einem Preis von 21.450 Franken schont man nicht nur seinen Geldbortel, sondern auch die Umwelt. Go Green!","Now for a street-fagg-like second part out of the car because Salon in Game we are the fat, thick, expensive and the coolest guy on the track now we come to the absolutely unobtrusive top 3 The average average skid is made in Britain. The Aston Martin, the DBS, the Volante, for 271,420 francs. The Porsche, after the top three, the most dangerous, continues and on the victory track it has again made an Englander. Ladies and gentlemen, the Rolls-Royce on third place. Not only the Queen, but the traditional exquisite to appreciate. The Phantom Drophead Coupe, with a length of 5.6 meters, is a fascinating car. The V12 engine is 250 km long, but if you want to get in, you can't really pull it out. If you're in a Rolls Royce, it's about enjoying the ride, enjoying the peace and the time you take to be on the road with a car like this. All handwork including the finest leather and wood. And of course that has its price. For proud 600,000 francs, In the Halla 1 we meet Josh Keller, Head of External Affairs at Bugatti. The normal Veyron, the second-class Audi Opus 8, is €1.2 million. The front wheel drive is €1.4 million. The supercar offers special features. The Veyron has a 16-cylinder engine with 1100 hp and has a top speed of almost 400 km. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km per second in 2.5 seconds. And interestingly, you brake from 100 to 0 to 2.3, so you brake in a shorter time than you accelerate. For a calculated 2.1 million francs, the fast dream of wheels can soon be heard. Thus, the Bugatti Veyron Blu Sainte-Neyer on rank 2. By the way, Bugatti celebrates its 100th year this year. Congratulations! But our number 1 of the 79th International Auto Salon is in Hall 3. Luxury limousine or fast sports blitzers. The point of view is not on horse power but on environmental protection. The Wagenmaid in Spain is doing it. and now I was able to offer you the efficiency. This car is capable of the throne of popularity. Because with a price of 21,450 francs, you don't only save your money, but also the environment. Go Green!"

Anyway, yeah I know there's like a lot of covers of this on YouTube but you know, whatever. Okay so the product I'm going to be using today is the 88 matte palette but that's only because I don't have the shimmer palette but I would recommend using the shimmer palette if you have it because that's pretty much like the look is really shimmery. But the main colors are orange, yellow, and black. I'm going to see how the black works. I might just stick with the, I don't know, I'll wing it. I'm totally winging all this I haven't practiced it for. But I'm also going to use the Covergirl Eye Enhancers, the Quad in Dazzle Metallics. I don't know. It's really like shimmery. But I'm probably going to use those two main colors for the eyeshadow because it's shimmery and the matte palette. So I don't really know what I'm going to do with a matte palette. Anyway. Okay, so I'm going to prepare my eyes with L'Oreal Decrease as I always do. I'm gonna play it because I actually don't want to hear it. It just reminds me of someone I don't want to think about. Someone who is just killing me. Um, okay, so what I'm gonna do is use the yellow all over my eye. I'm gonna use my finger. I'm such a finger applicator. Oh my god, I'm like, so use that all over the lid. You really need to use an eyeshadow base with this. And also, I'm using them wet. I have like a wet washcloth that I'm just dipping my finger I'm going to take a brush and use it on the orange color. on or whatever. I'm really loading on my brush because the color's gotta be intense. And I hate that this mirror is like touch. I don't know how I touched the wrong way. I just... yeah, just... shit. So I'm gonna apply that on the outer and then just kind of just work it right in. Work it out! You're probably gonna get a ton of fallout so make sure you have like a fan brush. I'm just gonna use this powder brush right here. So I don't know if you can really see that, but anyway that orange is like supposed to be really vibrant and dark as well as the yellow But so that's what I did with that and now I'm gonna use the L'Oreal hip Color truth cream eyeliner in black, which is number 905 Which I was wondered like why do they have those numbers like and as well as the color like who's gonna be like oh, yeah, I use the 905 And you know, I'm gonna be like oh, he's the place the plum So I'm gonna line my lower, my lower, that intensifies that little step. But I'm pretty sure she has winged liner in this, so I'm gonna be able to show you how I do it, even though I'm really not good at it. And I just messed up my hair. Okay, hold on, I'm gonna reach my camera. Close and personal with K-Trip like a swizzle. That's what I felt like, this is like really close. Okay, so I'm gonna be using just an angled brush, and I'm gonna just lightly dip it in the color truth. Kind of just wave it around a little bit, make it settle a little bit. And that's my mirror on zoom, which is good. So I'm just gonna lightly pull at my eye, like the slightest bit. Okay? Start in the middle and work out. And now for the wing, you're not gonna pull on your eye because it's gonna screw up where it goes up. And this, because it is like that intense look, it doesn't matter if it's like really I kind of make a V and then I fill it in after. Now I am gonna make my straight. I contributed myself. Do you see? Now I am gonna because I'm trying to make the top line straight I contributed myself a lot. Do you see that? I'm gonna do my other eye. Hold on. Hey, so you see in that? You see in that? I think it just looks really cool because it's like fiery. Awesome. I've worn this to work before and gotten like tons of compliments on it. I'm pretty like crazy with my makeup. like most people would be like, ah, work makeup? oh my god it has to be like neutral and like brown! but no, I have one like bright pink before. everyone likes it so like, yeah it's not like I get... weird looks or anything. okay so I actually I guess I am gonna use the 88 palette mainly just because I don't have a highlighter on so I'm just gonna use like that whitest one just for the brow bone like really highly. again, the finger. there's that. I'm gonna just draw on some mascara and then I'll just... back. There we go. That's pretty much the finished product. Actually in the video, it's hard to tell because I was watching it on YouTube, but like, she's got a lot of black, like, it's kinda like smoked out up to her tell. So I guess if you are like going for something or you could try that, but I wouldn't even know it. But maybe there's some other tutorials that would show you how to do that. But I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you try it, because it's awesome. Now we're just coming and like, you can wear like, more flirty, I don't know, type stuff. So you should go flirty with your makeup.

And that's my mirror on zoom, which is good. So I'm just gonna lightly pull at my eye, like the slightest bit. Okay? Start in the middle and work out. And now for the wing, you're not gonna pull on your eye because it's gonna screw up where it goes up. And this, because it is like that intense look, it doesn't matter if it's like really I kind of make a V and then I fill it in after. Now I am gonna make a straight. I contributed myself. Do you see? Now I am gonna because I'm trying to make the top line straight I contributed myself a lot. Do you see that? I'm gonna do my other eye. Hold on. Hey, so you see in that? You see in that? I think it just looks really cool because it's like fiery. Awesome. I've worn this to work before and gotten like tons of compliments on it. I'm pretty like crazy with my makeup. like most people would be like, ah, work makeup, oh my god it has to be like neutral and like brown. But no, I have one like bright pink before. Everyone likes it so like, yeah it's not like I get weird looks or anything. Okay so, I actually, I guess I am gonna use the 88 palette mainly just because I don't have a highlighter on so I'm just gonna use like that whitest one just for the brow bone like really highly. Again, the finger, there's that. I'm gonna just draw on some mascara and then I'll just... back. There we go. That's pretty much the finished product. Actually in the video, it's hard to tell because I was watching it on YouTube, but like, she's got a lot of black, like, it's kinda like smoked out up to her tell. So I guess if you are like going for something or you could try that, but I wouldn't even know it. But maybe there's some other tutorials that would show you how to do that. But I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you try it, because it's awesome. Now we're just coming and like, you can wear like, more flirty, I don't know, type stuff. So you should go flirty with your makeup. Flirty! Um, yeah, so I think that's about it."

Just one word. Yes sir. Are you listening? Yes sir. You. Plastics. Career advice. That's the theme for this week's the Weekly Strategy Memo. I'm Rich Taffel, president of RLT Strategies, and each week I answer a question from a world-changing leader. And this week's question comes to us from New York City. What sharpen me in this job search? Well, that is a very timely question with the unemployment rate skyrocketing and if you aren't unemployed You're thinking about what it might be if you're unemployed. So this is a question I think that is universal for everybody right now to think about and I do have some strategies To help out this moment and I think they'll be sort of unconventional strategies things you wouldn't hear from anybody else and the first let me just start with a warning the more proactive you are in your unemployment about creating this plan that we'll be talking about today and The better the longer you wait and the longer you procrastinate you'll get to the point where you won't have the ability to create strategies You will have to take whatever you can get so being proactive now creating this plan can make a big difference this question is really Such a complicated answer that I'm going to break into two strategy memos this week I'm going to focus on how you can prepare yourself next week how you can prepare your resume and your job punt itself so this week's about yourself and I'm going to talk about three major points that you could focus on in preparing yourself. And the first question I have for you is, what are you passionate about? Now I know this is really unconventional. How can you be talking about what you love and you're passionate about in an economy when people are fighting for jobs? Trust me. Go and figure out, write it out. What do you love? What are you passionate about? What do you really care about? Why should we be discussing this in a bad economy? Because answering that question will change how you interview. It'll change how you respond. It'll change your energy and should you land this job, it's going to be what gets you up on Monday mornings when it's cold out. So passion, what you love, what you care about, your values is an important first step to get clear on. Take the time and do it. Second step in this process is the second P I call power. It's your expertise. What are you uniquely good at? Ask yourself this question. What do I do that no one else in my town or city does? What do I do that no one in my country does? First response everybody gives me when I do that with my clients is, there's nothing really unique about me. I mean, there's nothing I could do that somebody else couldn't do better. I disagree. There's something that you do uniquely well. And finding your strengths is often very difficult. The reason is because it comes so naturally to you. I remember once when someone told me, you are really good at strategy and strategic thinking. I thought they were kidding because I thought everybody thought like that. But until someone else sometimes highlights it for us, we're not aware of our own strengths. Getting in touch with what you do well is going to be extremely important in this very competitive market. Two quick exercises you could do. One, email your friends the question, what do you think that I do uniquely well? You might be surprised, I think you will be surprised, the responses you get from people because it comes so easy to you. Another is a book that I recommend. that you get, Strength Finder. And the fun thing about this book is it has an exercise in the book that you can type in and it'll put you on the internet and it'll give you a test. And you'll be finished with five of your key strengths that you have. And I'd be glad to discuss those with you after you do the test. I've done it with all my clients and I've recorded all of their strengths and you could compare it to other people as well. But finding what you do uniquely well is the second important thing to do. Okay, the third thing is purpose, add up what you're passionate about to what you're uniquely good at. The second step, almost like a math equation and you'll get purpose. These two things, what you love and what you're uniquely good at will give you a unique market edge in the field. I call it your purpose. Write a purpose statement. Now again, people will be cynical. How could you be talking about purpose statements or mission statements in this economy? I'm going to resist this trend that you should be Like in the video we saw plastic malleable something that fits in for everybody I'm gonna argue that you need to be unique in the market you need to stand out in this market and that dollars flow from this unique market edge that you have for yourself Preparing yourself this way will make you stand out from the crowd as you prepare for your job search next week the strategies of actually going out and doing that search Let me know how it goes this week. I love your feedback, you can email me or ask me any questions. And that's this week's The Weekly Strategy Memo. Thanks for watching.","I just want to say one word to you. Just one word. Yes sir.

La verdad ser cierta en algunas empresas en general se ha hecho la vista gorda ante las débiles ganancias y recortes de expectativas. Algo que no debería sorprender si se tiene en cuenta sobre todo que las apuestas actuales miran más allá de la primera mitad del año. No obstante, según FACSET, el 75% de las empresas del Standard & Pulse ha reportado balances trimestrales y el 64% ha superado las expectativas en contraste al 41% en los dos trimestres anteriores. En este mismo sector, el miércoles se publicará el inicio de construcción de vivienda, una de las mejores referencias para medir la salud del mercado de bienes raíces, y que en enero podría sufrir un resbalón del 3,7% a 918.000 unidades.

Si en diciembre la caída fue un 1% en enero la demanda de casas usadas se contraerá un 1,8% a 480, 850 mil millones de unidades, según la previsión del consenso del mercado. Asimismo, los precios al productor y al consumidor concentrarán parte de la atención. Pese a que la La acción no fue un problema para la economía estadounidense en los últimos años. La importancia de seguir estos datos radica en que permite a la Reserva Federal centrar sus esfuerzos en reducir el empleo. A este respecto se espera una aceleración de precios al productor del 0,4% y del 0,1% en los precios al consumidor. Otras piezas claves del entramado económico son las actas de la última reunión de la Reserva Federal y el índice de manufacturas de la FED de Filadelfia que de cumplir con el estimado del consenso de menos un punto sumará dos meses consecutivos en negativo arrojando de nuevo dudas sobre la fortaleza del sector fabriil. Las piezas destacadas del bastidor empresarial en los próximos días son los fabricantes de hardware, Hewlett Packard y Dell con las ganancias del cuarto trimestre anticipadas en 71 y 39 centavos, respectivamente, así como la mayor cadena de distribución de artículos de descuento del mundo Walmart y la cadena hotelera Marriott.

However, according to FACSET, 75% of the Standard & Pulse companies have reported trimestral balances and 64% have exceeded expectations in contrast to 41% in the previous two previous trimestries. In January, the market will be able to offer a 3.7% increase to 918,000 units. of the existing houses, possibly lower by the second consecutive month, since many United States are still avoiding placing their houses in the market because they owe more for their mortgage than the properties. If in December the fall was 1% in January, the demand for houses used will be 1.8% to 480.850 million units, according to the market's consensus. In the same way, the prices to the producer and consumer will concentrate on the attention. The United States economy has been a problem for the last few years. The importance of following these radical data allows the Federal Reserve to focus its efforts on reducing employment. With this respect, a acceleration of prices to the producer of 0.4% and 0.1% in consumer prices is expected. Other key pieces of the economic entrammage are the actions of the last meeting of the Federal Reserve and the manufacturing index of the Fed of Philadelphia, which will be the estimate of the consensus of minus one point will be added two consecutive months in a negative way, again doubting the strength of the Fabril sector. The outstanding pieces of the company's stock market in the coming days are the hardware-hue-le-packer and Dell manufacturers with the profits of the quarter-term anticipated in 71 and 39 cents respectively, as well as the largest distribution chain of discounted items in the world, Walmart and the hotel chain, Marriott.

Eu pensei que nunca lo iba a escuchar de nadie. Nunca. Esto de que Maradona é o maior corrupto e coimero que hai en el fútbol argentino. É un mochato que se va de boca.

Usted cree que como va Diego Armando Maradona va terminar mal? Non sabria de 7. Pero lo ve mal? Usted que lo conoce tanto, que ha visto, las 24 horas del día. Eu creo que se tiene que tratar de rodear de gente que lo quiera. O tema que ele non sabe ver se cuenta a gente que lo quiere e a gente que lo usa. Hay gente que lo usa? Lo usa, muchísimos. Pero no... Hay momento que pensas que ele lo sabe e... pero le sirve. Pero ao final del camino te das cuentas que no. Que no sabía.","You spoke badly of Jorge, you spoke badly of Jorge before going to Dubai. Mr. Biller spoke badly of Coppola, he finished his hug, his kisses and taking photos and crying in the trial. He spoke badly of Daniel Volonnikov, he spoke badly of Christian Traverso, who was the other person who we did together in Dubai. He ended up fighting. not recognizing commissions, not recognizing anything. So this, from the coimas, gave me the desire to come and say what I had many years ago saved. It is very impressive because you told me the phrase more ... I thought I would never hear it from anyone. Never. This is that Maradona is the greatest corrupt and coimero there is in Argentine football. Look. He's a boy who leaves his mouth. If he had been a mute, he would have been a world star. He could have been at the time, but not now because his mouth is covering everything he did inside the stage. Who is now with Diva? He's the troupe, Enrique, the teacher, Javier and his girlfriend. That's the girl's table. I don't care about the environment, the intimate environment. I don't care about the bad things in life. I don't care about yesterday. I don't care about yesterday's loss. I'm happy because everything was cut off. I did too much and I think that all this deserves other people. I recognize you, you work well, that in 13 years I didn't have a stain, you will never tell me, you had to bring 10 pesos and you brought 9, and I have many, and well, let's see how this goes. Do you think that as I say, Armando Maradona, it will end badly? I would say so. But you see it badly, you know it so much, you have seen it 24 hours a day. I think it has to be about surrounding people who love him. The issue is that he doesn't know how to tell people who love him and the people who use him. There are people who use him. They use him, a lot. But there are times when you think he knows it but it serves him. But at the end of the road you realize that he didn't know. We talk a lot."

Wir sind Kaiser. Einer der Gäste, Dominik Heinzel. Moment, ich bin hier bestellt, dass es nicht so, dass ich um meine Audienz gebeten habe. Wie wurde die Audienz gefolgt? Bitte, Dominik Heinzel ist mein Name. Haben Sie auch Begleitpersonen mit? Nein, ich bin immer ganz allein. Ich hole die Kollegen runter, sie wollen mir zeigen. Gut, da geht es schon lustig zu. Am heutigen Abend sind zwei Aufzeichnungen geplant. Vorerst ist noch die erste Sendung mit den Gästen August Schmelzer, Prinz Mario Max zu Schaumburg-Lippe und HC Strache im Gange. Der hat seine Audienz noch vor sich. Sie können schon hinaufgehen, die sind am Barton. Schon Stunden zuvor stellen sich die Gäste für die Kaiserspiele an. Der Saal im Haus der Industrie hat aber wirklich geschichtlichen Hintergrund. Immerhin eröffnete Kaiser Franz Josef im Jahre 1911 in diesem Saal höchstpersönlich das Gebäude. Im Gästezimmer herrscht und zu dessen imperiale Ruhe. Ich glaube, das wird gefühlt sein. Ich glaube, wir werden uns das vorgenommen. Jetzt ist das rote Kreuz bereit. Eine behördliche Auflage. Ohne Notarzt dürfte die öffentliche Aufzeichnung nicht stattfinden. Schließlich könnten die Zuschauer von Lachen unmächtig werden. Erste Hilfe hätte Heinz-Christian Strache dringend nötig. Der Kaiser bringt den mächtig ins Wanken. Ein Auftritt bei Hofe ist keine Wahlveranstaltung am Brunnenmarkt. Ich habe auf Blätter gesehen, wo man sich intensiv in alle Richtungen vorbereitet hat. Was hat der Staat gehört, dass du vorbereitet hast? Ich habe mich vorbereitet, auswendig gelernt. Ich glaube, ich habe da auch ein paar Zetteln gesehen, wo man weiter gelesen hat. Das kann schon sein. Na wie jetzt? Ist das spontan oder? Das weiß ich ja nicht, was auf seinem Zettel war und was er jetzt gesagt hat, ob das jetzt vom Zettel kommt, kann man ja nicht nachvollziehen. Aber er hat auf jeden Fall sicher sich gut vorbereitet, ist ja ein bekannter berühmter Politiker und wie spontan die dann wirklich sind, weiß ich nicht. Wenig später beendet seine Eminenz die Audience. Und der Politiker ärgert sich grün und blau. Vor allem blau. Ich hätte gerne einen Kaiserrap voran bereitet, weil die Sendung abgesetzt werden soll. Das Plakat hat die Inhalte, die Kaiserdraht, statt OF-Pensionen, wie für Robert Heinrich, das bleiben kann. Die Sendung fortgesetzt wird. Da haben wir einen kleinen Rap auch getext. Mach mal den für ATV. Ich mach für euch exklusiv den Kaiserrap, den ich heute nicht vortragen konnte. Quotenkaiser ist. Das verbindet uns ja auch, weil ich bin auch Quotenkaiser. Wenn es darum geht, in den Sommergesprächen aufzutreten, dann haben wir etwas gemeinsam. Dann würde ich mir wünschen, dass er bleibt. Auch wenn wir heute leider wenig Möglichkeit gehabt haben, etwas zu sagen. Der mag dich halt nicht. Das kommt vor im Leben. Wenn sich die Tür schon öffnet, stehe ich neben Ihnen. Wir nicken einander kurz zu. Anschließend weise ich Ihnen den Weg zum Thron, bitte. Sie gehen über diese Stiege bis vor, zu seiner Meistät. Nein, hier. Hier. Vor seiner Meistät die Herren tiefe Verbeugung, Übergabe des Geschenkes. Seiner Meistät weist Ihnen dann den Platz zu. Wir reden nur, wenn wir gefragt haben. Wir werden Ihnen anschließend die Türe öffnen und Sie können rückliegen. Abwand darf man sich umdrehen. Ich würde sagen, sobald Sie den roten Bereich verlassen haben. Das Geschenk? Sie müssen sich allerdings auch von seiner Reaktion überraschen lassen. Selbstverständlich, nehmen kauf. Aber ich will nur nicht sein. Bitte? Gut, aber ihr könnt mir vorstellen, dass ihr doch nach einem Glas Wasser kriegt. Wenn sie eine Mesdid trinkt, mehr die Liter Champagner täglich. Da können sie versichert sein. dem ersten von Gottes Gnaden Kaiser von Österreich. Das ist US Dominic Heinz.","The house of the industry at the Schwarzenbergplatz is today's showroom for the TV show of the coming season. We are Kaiser. One of the guests, Dominik Heinzel. At the moment there are two drawings planned. First is the first broadcast with the guests August Schmelzer, Prince Mario Max to Schaumburg Lippe and HC Strache in the hallway. He has his audience still in front of him. You can go up there and wait for them. The guests are already in the process of presenting the emperor's play. The hall in the house of the industry has a really historical background. The emperor Franz Josef in 1911 opened this hall in this way, especially the building. In the guest room, there is a real peace. You have to be very quiet, do you hear everything? Do you want to go out to the bathroom? You have a strategy? Of course it's not a strategy. But I think... Some kids go in and try to adapt to their weight. I think that's a mistake. I think that would be the most difficult. I think we will take it out. The first aid would have now been necessary for Heinz Christian Strache. The emperor brings the power into the bank. An entrance to the court is not a choice for the event at the Brunnenmarkt. I saw some letters where you were intensively prepared in all directions. What did you prepare? I learned to prepare myself. I think I saw some papers where you continued reading. That could be. How now? Is it spontaneous? I don't know what was on the paper and what he said. If it comes from the paper, you can't understand it. But he certainly prepared himself well. He is a famous politician and how spontaneous they really are. I don't know. A little later his Eminence ends the audience and the politician gets angry green and blue, especially blue. I would like to send a Kaiser-Rap to you, because the broadcast will be broadcast. The poster contains the Kaiser-Drom, instead of the UF-Mension, as for Robert Heinrich, which can stay. The broadcast will be broadcast and there is a small rapper next to you. We do that for ATV. We do that for ATV. I do it exclusively for you, the Kaiser-Rap, which I unfortunately couldn't present today. The ORF is in the crisis because of its management of the mine. Only to serve the old man is the forced birth of us. The sea is changing in other sectors, the highest time to change something, for the security of our coins it needs to be knitted on the public. As a TV Emperor it has to stay. Guarantee the quota, because without its audience the number of the sea is still decreasing. The audience for the second appointment with Dominik is is a very important. We will open the doors and you can turn around. You have to be surprised by his reaction. Of course, take it. But I don't want to be. Please. Okay. But I can imagine that after a class, you won't get anything to drink. If your amnesty drinks more than a liter of champagne a day, then they can be secured. the first of the goddess Gnaden, the emperor of Austria. Dominic Heinz!"

Continuing with this, it is good to use objects that are chains and above all that use objects and the ... oh what are they ... and the pure-toy bombs. Well, a virus can also be broken, just like the last one that came out, it can be broken by defense, it is left to be protected and it can be removed much more. I would also be good here as a minimum would be a fighter and a ... and a jury as a minimum but you can do with any other character too so it would not be so much trouble. A lot of express I want to do it again.

So it basically allows us to represent huge volumes of data in, you know, like a visual manner, like a chart or a pie chart or a graph or, you know, that kind of stuff. With that you also see there is an option called as map. So it allows us to represent geographical data in the form of a map. We will take this in a separate tutorial where we discuss what are SRE files and you know how to create layers in a map, how to embed data in a particular map and so on and so forth. In this tutorial what we are going to look at is how to you know get some data set and then represent the data in the form of a graph or a chart or something like that. like that. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new report and the same new item and I'll call this as graphs. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I am going to create the same data set which I created for my metrics report. So we have some data to work with. All right. So we'll go to graphs. First of all, create a connection string. Okay. And then I am going to create a new data set. Make sure I remove the backclaws because I don't need any parameters over here. Alright, so I have some data to work with. So, so far we have seen that we have dragged and dropped the table control, matrix control and you know so on and so forth. But what we are going to do over here is we are going to drag and drop a chart control. So as soon as we do that, you see that you get a pop up which I'll see you that which shape do you need. And then you see there are a lot of graphs for us where there are column charts line charts, shapes, bars, area and so on and so forth. So, you know, I would really encourage you to explore more on this one, maybe try out different shapes. For this tutorial, let's take something very simple, like maybe maybe the first one. So as soon as you click on OK, you see that there is kind of like a structure of the graph represented over here. And this is what we need to configure. Now, just to give you a heads up, Everything over here is totally configurable like you could really change the title to have something like my first graph. You could actually write an expression for this one. You can totally control the legends, totally control the colors. You can make the colors dynamic and so on and so forth. So what we will do is let's go back to our report data and let's, okay. So we are going to use the country region code in our X and Y axis and let's have the year. Let's see what makes sense over here in the series. Let's have the year and in the totals let's have total due. Let's see how this looks like. Okay, we have some interesting graph which basically shows you the country region code and for 2002 that is basically a legend created for you. the sales was around 25 million or more than 25 million and so on and so forth. Let's just make this a little bit bigger so that we can see more clearly. Let's hit preview. Okay, this looks somewhat nice. But again, now you would need this to be represented in a different format. So now you could really have a currency representation of this one and then kind of let's see, let's actually hit preview. So Okay, so yeah, so this is totally dynamic and then you know you could really write expressions, change colors or you know what do whatever you want. I would recommend you should be exploring the other tools also, the pie charts and stuff like that but essentially the concept remains the same that you need to define three things. One is x-axis, y-axis and what goes inside the graph. And REST SSR takes care of the remaining things. So that's all about visualization and how to embed graphs and stuff into your reports.

Während bei den Benzinern die beiden 1,4 Liter Saugmotoren mit 87 bzw. 100 PS mit 5,5 Litern je 100 Kilometer am Genügsamsten sind, benötigen die vier Diesel-Aggregate mit Leistungen von 95 bis 160 PS zwischen 4,2 und 4,9 Liter auf 100 Kilometer und stoßen somit nicht mehr als 129 Gramm pro Kilometer CO2 aus. Mit dem neuen Astra überträgt Opel zahlreiche Komfort- und Sicherheitselemente des Insignia in die Kompaktklasse. Ferner bietet der Astra Technologien wie das neue mechatronische Flex-Ride-Fahrwerk, das fortschrittliche, adaptive Fahrlicht, die Frontkamera mit Verkehrszeichenerkennung und Spurassistent sowie den Ergonomie-Sitz mit AGR Güte Siegel.

Zu den Motoren macht sie ja noch keine Angaben. Der neue Peugeot 5008. Der Compact Van 5008, was hier technisch auf der erfolgreichen 308-Bau-Reihe und bietet fünf bzw. sieben Sitzplätze. Die drei Sitze in der zweiten Reihe können einzeln zusammengeklappt und im Fahrzeugboden versenkt werden. Auf diese Weise entsteht ausgehend von der Kofferraumladekarte eine vollkommen ebene Ladefläche. Dazu, dass sich die Lene des Beifahrersitzes auf die Sitzfläche geklappt werden kann, reicht der Laderaum bei Bedarf bis zum Amaturanträger. Die nutzbare Länge beträgt in diesem Fall 2,76 Meter, was das Verstauen von langen und sperrigen Gegenständen erlaubt. Für den Peugeot 508 stehen zwei Benziner mit einem Leistungsspektrum von 120 und 156 PS sowie 3 HDi-Motoren mit serien mäßigen Rußpartikel-Filtersystem und einem Leistungsspektrum von 112 bis 163 PS zur Verfügung.

The rest is just a desperate to get rid of a place for another. To the search for something that no place can give to the soul in the heart of Pantani. Serenity. The slave of cocaine, poisoned by how successful and unable to react. Marco Pantani chooses solitude. He goes away from everything and from everyone. to the last escape, to the residence of Rimini. One of the incredible things about when I went to find him in the office was to see a serene face. It was five years that I didn't see his serenity. It was the only way to find serenity.

One są separowane, żeby nie zainteresować drugą i zbytą dystorsją. Możesz włączić mikrofon i włączić włożne włożenie, które oznacza, że dla solo performerów, zbyt mała banda, że możesz w ogóle zrobić gizę, nawet bez mikrofonu. więc jest wstępnie, również w tym, jak jest wody w kawałku. Wygłady na połowę i to ma naprawdę dobre, silne monitor. Co o tym, jak jest wstępnie? Amplify w połowie są bardzo lewe, więc w tym momencie jest ok. 15 kg. Nie jest w klas D, ma wciąż cink. Ale jak widać, też masz błogosław, więc można się odpocząć. Woliom kontrolu na górę wody lub mikrofonu. Powiedz, co to dla grupy targów? I to tylko przychodzi w tym miejscu? Tak, są dwa modeli w tym miejscu, 15, który jest w tym miejscu i w górę, a też jest sub, który jest w 18-iniecznym bądźmieniu. Wszystko jest wytworzone, więc to ma to bardzo zbyt komveniej na sklepach.","We are at Turbo Sound, where the representative of this company will tell us something about their line systems. and it's a typical turbo sound or sound product where we have a paper, vocal driver or compression driver that runs from 600 to 6 kHz which is what completely separates turbo sound from the rest of the industry and that driver is the vocal driver and gives a natural sound. This marks the return of turbo sound to large format concert touring. As you can see the box is capable of 147 dB peak which is a measured number and so It's a high impact, high output system. The first one is the TSMW 112 The model is a very similar design to the Tmw 115. The new model has a Tfm 560, which is a double 12 and a 2-inch. This is the big large format touring wedge. This wedge has a very interesting horn design, which is shaped the further you get from the wedge. The narrower the dispersion of the box. This is a very large axe and we've had some big touring names such as Left Field out with this recently. What can you tell me about this new Milan Miu? family of powered speakers that TurboSound has. It's the smallest one, we call it MEO. It's a two-way, it's a 10-inch low frequency and a one-inch high frequency. Inside the back there is a power amplifier, in fact two power amplifiers. They are separated so that one will not influence the other and create distortion. You can connect a microphone and you can connect a line input which means that for a solo performer, a duo, a very small band, you can actually do your gig even without a mixer. It's self-contained, as well as being in front of a house box. You put it on its side and it makes a really good powerful monitor. What about the weight, since it's inactive? The amplifiers inside are actually very light, so we're in looking at about 15 kilos or so. It isn't class D, it does have heat sinks. But as you can see, also you have bass and treble, so you can shape your sound as well. A volume control for the line input or the microphone. What is the target group? Do you only come in that size? Yes, there are two other models in the range, the 15, which is obviously a 15 and a top end and there's a sub as well, which is an 18 inch band pass sub. Everything is powered, so it makes it very convenient for a quick set up and tear down."

The reason for that is various reasons. into it my voice is a little hoarse right now because I have been sick that's part of the reason part of the other reasons were Skyrim and Skyrim that's pretty much it but I made a video for tribes ahead I made a video for tribes ascend because I got a beta key it's crazy I got a beta key because I got connections and shit I just I know people Anyways, this game is pretty fucking, it's pretty damn fun. I mean I'm running around right here, and I don't know how to play I'm not very good at it like in fact I'm pretty much total shit at it, but I played a lot.

It's a great game I mean it's just like so much tactics that go into it and you really got to work with your team and all the weapons are like right here like tactics I'm kind of I'm kind of just hanging out here behind this pillar hiding waiting for the flag to return to base and as soon as it does I can just run in and pick it up and run back to base and it's got this thing called a scheme which is really awesome you see these maps are gigantic they're just humongous massive maps so what you got to do to get across them real fast use the thing called scheme as the guys are gonna kill me right here I'm just not gonna get any kills and Most most people will call you anew for using the pistol. There's also an assault rifle with with the other class that I have, there's a ton of classes, but I only have two unlocked right now, because I suck at the game. And when you unlock more classes, by getting tokens, you get tokens, by getting kills, and getting the flag and other things, but I can't do that because I suck at this game. Anyways, really good game. I get killed a lot by this Lantus guy, don't worry about that. Boom, new map. Alright, so I figured you guys didn't want to just watch me, you know, suck at this fucking game. game and talk about how much it suck at the game so I decided to show you a part where I was doing really good see like I just picked up the flag right there I'm just gonna fucking juked out all these guys just fly on back to base using my skiing abilities that I learned but uh anyways so I wanted to show you some more of my battle techniques right here like that guy I thought he was gonna get away from me fucking Exorcrete Exocede I don't even know what his fucking name is killing with my spin fuser I got the flag again this time I'm not gonna fucking die to that tank guy up there so I decided to go this way fly around the side get behind this building they can't even see me man they can't even see me I'm going so fast going like hundred fucking 50 miles per hour my heart's beating so fast and I just I can't I can't stop I can't stop this game just gets me so worked up whatever fuck never never mind fucking ecstasy guy again fucking kill him again he doesn't know he's messing with man I've been playing this game for days whatever forget it And it was just fucking extra creep guy guy killed him again. Oh my god fucking dead I killed him again doesn't even know me he doesn't know me I just killed him like three times in a row God fucking hate that guy. It's like the worst player at this game ever I mean, I mean what's this guy doing here? You like got the flag. He's keeps throwing it on the ground like what do you want me to take it? Okay, I'll take it You know I'm way better at this game than you obviously, so I'll take it just flying out of here. It's like five guys chasing me No problem. I'll just ski out with my I'm fucking pro skills that I learned from you know total biscuit and everybody else to done coverage of this game way before me but didn't don't think about that anyways so there's like three guys chasing me I got the flag I'm almost there I'm like right next to my base I'm I think I'm gonna make it right looks looks pretty good for me right here I got like what okay my health's pretty low don't worry about and I get back here the fucking flag's not there I can't return the flag so of course it's gonna hold it out there You know, just try to kill like the four people that are following me.

So if you've ever used any kind of web-based file management interface that allows you to navigate between folders and upload files, this will seem familiar to you straight away.

Well first of all I decided to upload this trailer even though there are hundreds already because their quality stinks.    SO I felt that I should make a tribute to this awesome game by uploading the best quality I am able to.    Right so what is this game? It's called Zone of the Enders 2 and it was made by Konami for the Playstation 2. Way back in 2003 I believe I saw the trailer for this on a PS2 Demo and it just entranced me. So I got into it more and bought the first game which made me even more excited for the arrival of this one. So year after year it was delayed and stupid me got angry because I was eager to play it. At this present time I can understand now as someone who is aiming to get into the Games Industry (As of 2011, I got my first job in the games industry!) I can truly respect the amount of work that must have gone into making this game!    Anyway the game can be a bit repetitive in the gameplay aspect but the story and the effects make it really good. Also the team made sure each part in the game was unique and boy did it have its moments...I remember taking down a whole fleet of ships in a matter of minutes or fighting 1000 orbital frames...Amazing cinematic style gameplay...Plus the high speed really pulled me in.    Anyway perhaps by watching this it might make more people buy it...You see we're eager to get a third game made for the PS3 but due to sales on ZOE2 it might not happen. Hope has arisen as a PS3 magazine stated it was in the making but never continued on about it...Might have been lies to gather more readers...    Anyway enough of my story. Enjoy the video and check my profile for Half life 2 videos aka Episode 1 and the soon to come EP2.    Oh and I wrote this about 2 hours ago before uploading...Why? Because the first time I uploaded it I forgot about the 100 MB limit so I've spent 2 hours trying to get the best quality but keep it at that file size limit...Hope this is good enough for your enjoyment...Ha ha I just spent another hour looking for the MP4 codec and it turns out MP4 and MPEG 4 are the same XD","two, Zone, habboi, definition, high, Enders",113977,394,251,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/O5jZ-920YmA.mp3,"Since the dawn of history, human beings have realized various forms of energy.

Several people, several Mexican architects, and a very large number of people were involved. The head of the area of ​​pantyons of Morelia Mauricio de Aservantes has been in charge of bringing together the history of this place and it points out that even family members of José María Morelos and the grave where the The rest of Ignacio Chavez, director of the University of Michoacana, San Nicolás Didalgo, are still present. Yes, we have here the only noble who is here in the municipal pantheon, it is a marquis. It is the Alessandro Anguisola Racini, he is the principal of San Mauricio of Italy. I was told that in specific his family are sculptors, painters. Yes, they are artists almost all, they are sculptors, painters, painters too, I found one in the painting on the page. We don't have records of what Morelia did, but I do participate in the design of a monument to Morelos. We don't know if it's the one in San Diego or the one that was here next to the cathedral. Morelia's municipal pantheon is distinguished by the funerary art, mainly characterized by angels. In the place there are five figures, the fugitive angel stands out. as well as the culture of the trees in Marmor, evidence of the style in the treatment of the characteristic form of the Mexican italo. The remains of Don Ramón is all marble, it should have been made by some Italian, because it was very fashionable that the Italians were here since Don Porfirio brought all the Italian and Belgian French, because there were many engineers, architects and artists, so we have a lot of influence on them. Death, magic, mysticism, it is what we can find in the municipal pantheon of Morelia, however, as every year we are left with a choice. The so thin thread falls between life and death."

Aquí en esta área estamos en niveles competitivos de la región pero aquí necesitamos que esto así sea también en la campo de productores. eso con la tecnología que se ha transferido y con variedades tanto de la asociación como de nosotros como de lintas. Perfectamente, perfectamente. Estos campos como campos de algunos productores de avanzada que vienen ese manejo de la tecnología y producen 9 toneladas. Bueno, ahorita en esta cosecha de invierno sacamos 124 quintales por medio de una finca por masano en la cosecha de invierno que tenemos poca luminosidad que variedad, a nard 2006 la cosa en verano ustedes saben que es otra situación tenemos mayor irrayación solar y alcanzamos mejores rendimientos en el invierno cosecha ¿Qué pasa? Alcanzamos 161 quintal con mayor irradiación ¿verdad? Que esos son los factores determinantes para obtener los mejores rendimientos. Adjunto pues a otras condiciones de fertilización, época de siembra, manejo control de maleza, etcétera. Esas son las cosas que hemos manejado y hemos llegado a la conclusión que toda la variedad de los costos de producción verdad, creo que ahora con la baja del combustible, del crudo, las cosas tienen que ir se acomodando un poco allá, ustedes saben que no se va a hacer un solo porque nadie está para perder y entonces tienen que ir se acomodando de acuerdo a los inventarios. Pero espero que los costos tienen que ir en descendencia y de acuerdo","and produces also the dry manual until 100 quintals per mason. The production levels here in comparison to other countries, how are we? We are in the region producing 5-6 tons, we are in the region producing 4 tons with cost and the drought 2.5. We need to increase that by the technology, at least 4 tons and by the ergonomic way, we can pass 5-6 tons. What is the message? Here in this area we are at competitive levels in the region, but here we need this to be in the producers' fields. We can get 140 kiltales per year. We are at the average of any country with high production. But that's what we handle when there is technology. The areas that manage producers advanced from the Ruseiro National Association produce 10 tons. 9 tons. Here is a man who is a producer and has that level of production. 9 tons in all of his fields. With the technology that has been transferred and with varieties both from the association and us, as from the INTA. This field can serve. Also for the production of seeds to show that in the country there is potential to produce. Perfectly, perfectly. These fields as fields of some advanced producers that come in that, let's say, that management of the technology and produce 9 tons. Well, right now in this winter harvest We take out 124 quintals of average on the farm. In the harvest of winter, we have little electricity. We have more solar radiation and we achieve better performance. We reached 161 quintals with greater radiation, right? That these are the decisive factors to obtain the best performance. Together with other conditions of fertilization, in the time of siem, handling, control of the malleus, etc. These are the things that we have handled and we have reached the conclusion that all the variety of What we have to do is to manage it properly to achieve the benefits of irrigation, especially those that do not have any cost and that helps us greatly to obtain what we wanted. The production costs, yes, well right now we are going for 1,500 and a peak of dollars, yes, I think that now with the low fuel consumption, the crude oil, things have to be accommodated a little. You know that it will not be done alone because no one is to lose and then it has to be accommodated according to the inventories. But I hope that the costs have to go in decency according"

Today we're going to show you how to make our gravy biscuit breakfast. This is delicious. What you're going to need is some country sausage, some butter, some heavy whipping cream, some flour, some milk, your biscuits, and some salt and pepper. For all the exact amounts for each ingredient, be sure to check out grillingandchillingrecipes.com. Here we go. Alright, let's start out with the biscuits. These are just the good old kind. You come in a can, pop it open, and we like to put a little tinfoil on the cookie sheet. clean up easy. We've sprayed that down even though it doesn't say that on the can. I still like to put a little cooking spray on there just to make sure they don't stick. Here we go into the oven we're going to put that in just follow the instructions on the can for that. Now we've got a little pad of butter in this iron skillet. We're going to melt it down. Next thing we're going to do is get that sausage in there and we're just going to put the whole thing right in the skillet. All right we've got the sausage in now it's just a matter of starting getting it to to break up a little bit and we've got this on medium low heat. I always like to slow cook the sausage. Getting it broken down here. We're going to just start letting it simmer a little while. Now we're starting to look good here. Starting to smell real good at this point. In with the flour. Spread it around nice and even. Try to get it all over the sausage if you can. Get that stirred in a little bit, incorporate it down into the meat, into the juices. Now here we go with the milk and you'll notice we're going to add this real slow. Reason is you don't want to go in there and change the temperature or reduce the temperature and skill it by too much by pouring a bunch of it in at once. So we're going to try to keep it hot. Just add it nice and slow and keep stirring it in as you go. A little bit of a slow process here, but we're making headway. And believe me, it'll be worth it when you taste this gravy. It is good stuff. All right, now we're gonna go through the same process with the heavy cream. Again, add that nice and slow. Gonna stir it in as we go. And this is basically the same process we just did. We wanna get all this in, bring everything back up to kind of a rolling simmer. Get it all incorporated in real good. Just stir as you go here. Keep it going. Don't want anything sticking to the bottom of the pan. Now we're gonna come back, add a little bit of salt. Just do this to taste. There we go. Get that stirred in. All right, now we got these biscuits ready to come out of the oven looking good. I'm ready to take a bite of those right now. Yes, sir. All right, we're gonna add a little pepper. Now we got it simmering just like we want it. Get everything stirred in nicely. You can see it's starting to thicken up good here. And while we're simmering that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn the heat off, because that's an iron skillet that stays hot for a good while. And we're getting ready to get these biscuits sliced open plate some up folks you got to try this it is delicious let me tell you it's looking good yeah this may not be the most healthy thing in the world for you but man let me tell you get ready to splurge one weekend this is some good stuff that's right every now and then won't hurt you it's good stuff and that might go real good with our cheesy eggs and our grits which you can also find on grilling and chilling recipes dot com along with many other great recipes and videos so thanks for stopping by and we'll see you next time absolutely Check us out.

Getting it broken down here, we're going to just start letting it simmer a little while. Now we're starting to look good here. Starting to smell real good at this point. In with the flour, spread it around nice and even. Try to get it all over the sausage if you can. Get that stirred in a little bit, incorporate it down into the meat, into the juices. Now here we go with the milk and you'll notice we're going to add this real slow. Reason is you don't want to go in there and change the temperature or reduce the temperature and skill it by too much by pouring a bunch of it in at once. So we're going to try to keep it hot. Just add it nice and slow and keep stirring it in as you go. A little bit of a slow process here, but we're making headway. And believe me, it'll be worth it when you taste this gravy. It is good stuff. All right, now we're gonna go through the same process with the heavy cream. Again, add that nice and slow. Gonna stir it in as we go. And this is basically the same process we just did. We wanna get all this in, bring everything back up to kind of a rolling simmer. Get it all incorporated in real good. Just stir as you go here. Keep it going. Don't want anything sticking to the bottom of the pan. Now we're gonna come back, add a little bit of salt. Just do this to taste. There we go. Get that stirred in. All right, now we got these biscuits ready to come out of the oven looking good. I'm ready to take a bite of those right now. Yes, sir. All right, we're gonna add a little pepper. Now we got it simmering just like we want it. Get everything stirred in nicely. You can see it's starting to thicken up good here. And while we're simmering that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn the heat off, cause that's an iron skillet that stays hot for a good while. And we're getting ready to get these biscuits sliced, stoping, plate some up. Folks you got to try this. It is delicious. Let me tell you it's looking good. Yeah, this may not be the most healthy thing in the world for you, but man, let me tell you, you get ready to splurge one weekend. This is some good stuff. That's right. Every now and then won't hurt you. It's good stuff and that might go real good with our cheesy eggs and our grits, which you can also find on grillingandchillingrecipes.com along with many other great recipes and videos. So thanks for stopping by and we'll see you next time. Absolutely. Check us out. Thanks."

Je suis Blaise Fiedler, photographe et vous êtes ici dans mon studio à Moujain. Dans ce mini-cours, je vais vous parler d'un filtre essentiel dans la besace d'un photographe. C'est le filtre polarisant. On peut faire beaucoup de choses avec Photoshop. Mais ce filtre-là permet de faire des choses qu'il est impossible de faire ensuite en post-production. Il sert vraiment à deux choses, le filtre polarisant. c'est pour s'atturer plus les ciels et ça je vous l'accorde c'est pas sorcier à faire en post-production sous photoshop mais c'est quand même beaucoup plus rigolo à faire quand on le fait dans la prise de vue et la deuxième chose permet le filtre polarisant permet d'éliminer les réflexions pas les réflexions des obligantes les réflexions sur les surfaces lumineuses ici je suis devant un joli paysage et je vais donc donc me concentrer sur la qualité du ciel. Je vais déjà vous montrer le filtre polarisant. Je l'ai déjà monté sur mon appareil photo. Donc un filtre polarisant, c'est très simple, se vise exactement comme un filtre UV que vous avez. Mais la différence, c'est qu'il vient en deux parties, une partie qui tourne sur l'autre. Donc allons-y, moi je trouve que c'est plus commode pour le visser, d'enlever la On remet la bonnet si vous avez une bonnet qui n'est pas trop profonde. Contrairement à beaucoup d'autres filtres, ce filtre polarisant est un filtre qui se règle en le tournant. Vous réglez la puissance de ce filtre polarisant en le tournant. Je vais vous montrer des exemples du filtre polarisant à basse puissance et à sa puissance maximale. Je vais laisser pas mal de ciel dans cette photo pour vous montrer vraiment l'effet. Donc vous voyez, quand je... tout en faisant avec mon oeil dans le viseur, je tourne. Et donc là je vois vraiment de visu que je suis dans un mode polarisant très faible puissance, donc à l'enzy. Donc faible puissance, ça veut dire tout simplement que l'effet sur la photo est assez faible. Et maintenant je vais donc le tourner vraiment d'un quart de tour et ça va changer radicalement le ciel. C'est une photo, on voit qu'à un filtre polarisant, même si vous l'avez monté, vous pouvez presque éliminer son effet en le réglant au plus faible de sa puissance. Au plus fort de sa puissance, par contre, on voit un effet effectivement qui est très fort sur le ciel. Vous voyez comme il est noir ce filtre polarisant, comme il est sombre, et il va vous enlever deux diaphragmes de lumière. Vous voyez là je suis à 100 ISO et ma dernière photo a été prise à un 80e de seconde. Je m'étais mis sur f8 pour une certaine profondeur de champs. Malgré ce grand soleil, il ne faut certainement pas garder un filtre polarisant permanence sur votre objectif. Si vous travaillez en intérieur avec un ciel gris, le filtre polarisant n'aura aucun effet et au contraire, ça va vous obliger soit à monter vos isos, soit la conséquence va être des photos très froides. Alors une petite astuce, c'est vraiment l'objet premier de ce cours, c'est que, comme on a vu, bon, il y a un effet plus ou moins fort quand je tourne la bague du filtre polarisant. Par contre, le filtre polarisant ne va pas marcher avec tous les angles. Ce filtre polarise la lumière vraiment quand je suis perpendiculaire au soleil. Je vais apprendre une astuce, c'est l'astuce du pistolet. Si vous mettez votre pouce vers le soleil, pointé vers le soleil, Après, vous pouvez tourner votre main et quelle que soit la direction où est ma main, c'est là où je vais avoir la lumière polarisante la plus importante. Donc si je photographie avec le soleil comme ça, si je photographie dans cette direction là, vous voyez comme on pousse, on pousse et directement maintenant on va ligner au soleil. Je peux photographier dans cette direction là, je peux photographier vers le haut, je peux photographier vers le bas. Je vais avoir une lumière très polarisée. Si par contre, on peut photographier dans cette distance, dans cette direction là, Si vous me photographiez avec le soleil, tout à moi, je vais avoir une lumière, je vais avoir très peu d'impact avec mon filtre polarisant. Donc rappelez-vous, cette petite astuce vous permet de maximiser l'effet de votre filtre polarisant. Un filtre polarisant a une deuxième utilité, c'est pour liminer les réflexions. Et ça, si vous voulez photographier un lac par exemple, ou un pare-brise, Avec beaucoup de soleil sur votre lac, vous n'allez voir que la réflexion du soleil. Vous allez voir un lac tout blanc. En vous mettant à environ à 35°C par rapport à la source que vous êtes en照ographie, par rapport au lac ou au pare-brise, et en réglant votre filtre, vous allez pouvoir quasiment éliminer toutes ces réflexions et voir bien mieux la profondeur du lac, la beauté d'une mer bleue ou l'intérieur. d'une voiture. Voilà c'est la fin de ce petit topo sur les filtres volarisants. Je suis Blaise Villeur, photographe et je vous dis à très bientôt !","Hello and welcome! I'm Blaise Fidler, photographer and you are here in my studio in Mougin. In this mini-court, I will talk to you about an essential filter in the need of a photographer. It's the polarizing filter. We can do a lot of things with Photoshop, but this filter allows us to do things that are impossible to do in post-production. It really works with two things, the polarizing filter. It's to saturate the sky more. I agree with you that it's not necessary to do post-production under Photoshop, but it's much more fun to do when you do it in the viewfinder. The second thing that makes the polarizing filter allow you to eliminate reflections. Not the reflection of the objects, but the reflections on the luminous surfaces. Here, I'm in front of a nice landscape, so I focus on the quality of the sky I already showed you the polarizing filter I already mounted it on my camera so a polarizing filter is very simple it looks exactly like a UV filter but the difference is that it comes in two parts one part that turns on the other so at the end I find it more convenient to screw it If you have a very deep magnet, you can put it back on the magnet. Because unlike many other filters, this polarizing filter is a filter that is regulated by the turning. So you adjust the power of this polarizing filter by turning it. I will show you examples of polarizing filters with low power and with maximum power. Let's go! I let a lot of sky in this photo to show you the effect. So you see, while I'm doing it with my eye in the viewfinder, I turn and I see really clearly that I'm in a very weak polarizing mode, so in terms of power. So weak power means that the effect on the photo is quite weak. And now I'm going to turn it really a quarter of a turn and it will radically change the sky. This is a photo, you can see that with a polarizing filter, even if you have mounted it, you can almost eliminate its effect by adjusting it to the weakest of its power. To the strongest of its power, on the other hand, we see an effect that is indeed very strong on the sky. You see how it is black, this polarizing filter, as it is dark. And it will remove two diaphragm from the light. You see, I am at 100 ISO and my last photo The ISO was taken at 1.80 seconds, I put it on F8 for a certain depth of field. Despite this great sun, you must certainly not keep a permanent polarizing filter on your lens. If you work inside with a grey sky, the polarizing filter will have no effect and on the contrary it will force you to either mount your ISO or the result will be very slow photos. A little tip, it's the first thing to do, is that as we saw, there is a stronger effect when I turn the polarizing filter bag. On the other hand, the polarizing filter does not work with all angles. This polarizes the light really when I am perpendicular to the sun. I want to learn a tip, it's the pistol tip. If you put your thumb towards the sun, pointed towards the sun, then you can turn your hand and whatever direction you want to go, it's where you'll see the most important polarizing light so if I take a picture with the sun in this direction, as you can see, it's directly aligned to the sun I can take a picture in this direction, I can take a picture up, I can take a picture down I'll have a very polarized light if, on the other hand, I take a picture in this direction I will take a photo with the sun all the time I will have a light I will have very little impact with my polarizing filter so remember this little tip allows you to maximize the effect of your polarizing filter polarizing filter is a second utility is to eliminate reflections and that if you want to photograph a lake for example or a barbed wire With a lot of sun on your lake, you will only see the reflection of the sun. You will have a white lake. By putting you at about 35 degrees, compared to the source that you are in the stratosphere, so compared to the lake or the barbryze, and by setting your filter, you will be able to almost eliminate all these reflections and see much better the depth of the lake, the beauty of a blue sea or the interior. I'm a photographer and I'll see you soon !"

The Secretary of State pointed out that it was a bonus of 40,000 pesos per family and of 7,500 pesos of additional per son, which will be delivered once every June next. All families that receive a single family subsidy, family registration or social registration and that have a smaller score of 11,734 points on the social protection file, they will be able to access this benefit. In total, 1,677,000 families in all of Chile will be benefited from the food solidarity bonus, reaching 6,300,000 people. Thus, the bonus will benefit 36% of the total of the families and 44% of the families with social protection. This is how Maria Soledad de Reyano, Social Security Secretary, gave us all the information for our media. This bonus must be met with two requirements to access the bonus. First, it must be the 40% more vulnerable and also receive the family subsidy, the family signature or the social signature. To get this grant, there is nothing to do. All you have to do is get close to the IPS. We are going to inform you about a payment calendar of the day or the week in which you have to get close, probably in the month of July, and you have to go to withdraw the check. Between May 2012 and March 2011, the IPS rose by 3.8%. In both the IPS of food increased by 10.4%. as a consequence of this, it is estimated that in families of 20 percent poorer the increase in spending as a consequence of the greater price of food could have reached 8,000 monthly pesos in March of this year"

Well, the point where theta is equal to pi over 2 is right there, and we could plug in pi over 2 into that expression. Remember that cosine of pi over 2 is equal to 0, so 2 times 0 is 0, and we would get 1 for r in that case. when theta is pi over 2. So what we're looking for then is the slope of the tangent line at that point, or actually the equation of the tangent line at that point. So let's assume the equation, the tangent line looks something like that. It may be not quite, my line may be not as steep as it should be, but it's going to look something like that. Well we need two things for a tangent line. We need its slope and we need the point there. So the point we do know it to be x equals 0 and y equals 1. But we still need to find out what the slope is. Well the slope of a polar curve is going to be dy over dx and that happens to just be dy d theta over dx d theta. And since we know those already, we can plug those in. So our formula for the slope of the curve at any point is going to be dy dx x is equal to cosine theta minus 2 cosine 2 theta over negative sine theta plus 2 sine 2 theta. And all we have to do is plug into that theta is equal to pi over 2. Well, cosine of pi over 2 is 0, but 2 times pi over 2 is pi, and cosine of pi is negative 1, and negative 2 times negative 1 is going to give me positive 2. So my numerator winds up being positive 2. In the denominator, sine of pi over 2 is over 2 is 1 and I want that to be negative. 2 times pi over 2 is pi and sine of pi is 0, 2 times 0 is 0 so I'm going to end up with a 0 for the second term in the denominator. And so my slope is just negative 2. And so my tangent line is going to look something like y minus 1 is equal to negative 2 times the quantity x minus 0. Simplifying, we just get y is equal to negative 2 x plus one. That does make sense because the y intercept is one. My slope was a little bit not steep enough. It actually has a slope of negative two instead of mine indicates it's around negative one. But regardless that's all we have to do for that particular problem and this one is done.","In part C of this problem, we're asked to write an equation in terms of x and y for the tangent to the curve, to the graph of the polar curve at the point where theta is equal to pi over 2.

I wanted to make a couple videos about my experience with mania and psychosis. I already did a video about depression. And I know that me personally, I'm always curious about what other people's experiences with mania are that are not, you know, the textbook explanation, like things that they actually do and say and stuff like that, because everyone's experience is a little bit different. So I'm hoping that this is maybe, you know, will be kind of enlightening to other people and maybe satisfy some curiosity about it. For me, I've had two manic episodes, full-blown manic episodes, and they've both been in the last year. And they both have had psychotic elements with them. So it's kind of like they're kind of intertwined, but I kind of see them separately just because of the way that I exhibit these things. It's usually more manic stuff or more psychotic stuff like it's it's not so much everything at once So that's kind of why I'm putting this up into two videos more manic stuff in this video and psychotic stuff in another video I have some little notes too for myself here. If you see me looking like there's a lot of little things that I wanted to talk about I don't want to forget but first of all it usually starts out with like hypomania and To me hypomania is always good It's never bad because it's not to an extreme level where I'm like overdoing everything. It's just more like, you know, heightened creativity and more energy and stuff like that, but it's good. But then when I become manic, it starts being too much, you know. I become overly excited and overly happy, I guess you could say. And I get, you know, the racing thoughts. which is typical of mania and on the one hand it's kind of bad because you get like you can't stop them from coming and it literally feels like my brain's burning like it's on fire because there's so many thoughts that just won't stop it's like a constant voice in my head words just going going going but on the other hand it can be kind of good because it's kind of like burying me on to do things and something I like to do is writing so I usually write a lot is very frantically like stories and poetry and stuff like that when I'm manic. And it tends to be better than what I usually write, I think. So it's kind of like an interesting thing about it. Going along with that, you know, you have so many thoughts and so much energy and all this stuff that you're staying awake and you're not sleeping and you want to go out all the time. And I tend to drink a lot when I'm manic, which is bad. And I get these cravings to do things like mainly drugs like hardcore drugs, which is weird because I've never done hardcore drugs. So why I would have a craving for something that I've never even experienced is beyond me. But that's how I feel like in my brain. It makes me like literally start salivating when I think about it when I'm manic. And it's not good. It's hard to hold myself back from going out and getting those things and doing those things that are dangerous. to me, which I guess is the impulsive side of mania. Also, I tend to get really flirty with people and really talkative with strangers. The last time I got manic I was just, I went out and I talked to everyone that crossed my path. I was having like full-blown conversations with people in the grocery store. I went to a park with my kids and there's this lady sitting there and I I just went over to her and started talking to her about how she was doing that day and then she brought up that she was getting divorced so I started just asking her all about her divorce and her personal life and you know, having this like deep personal conversation with this person I never met and that's definitely not my style to do that. And you know, some of the people that I interact with I'd be you know, kind of coy and kind of he-he-he-giggly, which I'm giggly Anyway, so you can imagine when I'm manic it's like over the top ridiculous, but it's kind of strange in a way because I think that draws people to you more because they see you like oh, this is a nice person This one is having fun. This someone I want to talk to or be around and so it's it's really strange in that sense. It's not really you You know acting that way it is you but it's not your normal self But other people don't know that if they don't know you well I'm from being happy and excited to being really agitated and edgy and nervous. And it's like my whole feeling, mood, sensation of everything around me changes. It becomes like, unbearable. My thoughts become like torture to me. They're not like happy, good things that are pushing me to accomplish stuff. It's more like, oh my god, there's something in my head that I can't get out and I need to make it stop. So, it really does come cross over to like a totally different dimension. It sounds like science fiction but you know, I think you know what I'm saying. So that's kind of some of my experiences with mania, some little things here and there that I've done. Nothing too like horrible really. I did back my car into a telephone pole one time because I was so distracted by my thoughts. And so like, oh, that yeah, dented it all off and jacked it all up and I had just bought it like a month ago. That was not good. You know, it's just little things like that though. Nothing like nothing too strange and just the manic section of it. But in my next video I'll talk more about the weird sorts of things that I've done when I've been psychotic.","Hey everybody! I wanted to make a couple videos about my experience with mania and psychosis. I already did a video about depression. And I know that me personally, I'm always curious about what other people's experiences with mania are that are not, you know, the textbook explanation, like things that they actually do and say and stuff like that because everyone's experience is a little bit different. So I'm hoping that this is maybe, you know, will be kind of enlightening to other people and maybe satisfy some curiosity about it. For me, I've had two manic episodes, full-blown manic episodes, and they've both been in the last year. And they both have had psychotic elements with them. So it's kind of like they're kind of intertwined, but I kind of see them separately just because of the way that I exhibit these things. signs is usually more manic stuff or more psychotic stuff like it's it's not so much everything at once so that's kind of why I'm putting this up into two videos more manic stuff in this video and psychotic stuff in another video I have some little notes too for myself here if you see me looking away because there's a lot of little things that I wanted to talk about so I don't want to forget but first of all it usually starts out with like hypomania and to me hypomania is always good It's never bad because it's not to an extreme level where I'm like overdoing everything. It's just more like, you know, heightened creativity and more energy and stuff like that, but it's good. But then when I become manic, it starts being too much, you know. I become overly excited and overly happy, I guess you could say. And I get, you know, the racing side. which is typical of mania and on the one hand it's kind of bad because you get like you can't stop them from coming and it literally feels like my brain's burning like it's on fire because there's so many thoughts that just won't stop it's like a constant voice in my head words just going going going but on the other hand it can be kind of good because it's kind of like burying me on to do things and something I like to do is writing so I usually write a lot is very frantically like stories and poetry and stuff like that when I'm manic. And it tends to be better than what I usually write, I think. So it's kind of like an interesting thing about it. Going along with that, you know, you have so many thoughts and so much energy and all this stuff that you're staying awake and you're not sleeping and you want to go out all the time. And I tend to drink a lot when I'm manic, which is bad. And I get these cravings to do things like mainly drugs like Hardcore drugs, which is weird because I've never done hardcore drugs So why I would have a craving for something that I've never even experienced is beyond me But that's how I feel like in my brain it makes me like literally start salivating when I think about it when I'm manic And it's not good. It's hard to hold myself back from going out and getting those things and doing those things that are dangerous to me, which I guess is the impulsive side of mania. Also, I tend to get really flirty with people and really talkative with strangers. The last time I got manic, I went out and I talked to everyone that crossed my path. I was having full-blown conversations with people in the grocery store. I went to a park with my kids and there's this lady sitting there and I I just went over to her and started talking to her about how she was doing that day and then she brought up that she was getting divorced. So I started just asking her all about her divorce and her personal life and having this deep personal conversation with this person I never met. That's definitely not my style to do that.

We have now experienced the problem, that the different sports teams are helping each other, and the result is that their own self-sufficiency can be reduced by a little.

What is this flag of the Judo club? It's a cross-country. I'm a local and I thought I'd improve here. The other side of the river, because the water doesn't come with it, we have to get it here. So you have to bring a motorbike, a bike, a judo, a boxer, a lot of sportsmen, or a horse? Well, this is a small bull, we came here to ride a little, to ride this. So the sport has such a good power? Well, this is also played in the middle, for sure. Do you always have to go to the army? Well, no, no. We will go to the army, too. We will find something more interesting.

Something like that. Which one is easy to get into or to drive? Well, to drive. It's easy. But there are people who are quite difficult. We have met with some of the ones who are real professionals. Because they are athletes, they are working hard. The animals are usually fed by the animals, of course not in this form. This is a good way to feed the animals, we also grow our little animals. Then I bring the other children to the feeding area to feed them. What is the difference between feeding and feeding here? Do you think it is similar? No, it is not similar, but we pack the cows in the feed. Do you feed them in a better box? Of course in the box. Of course not only the athletes work on the farm, The people of Szabócs were also there in March. Szabócs, did you have any news? Of course. I saw it on Facebook, they told me that I could come.

Que trigulada! Que gruda pro Gui! Que juta de primeira aí! O vidro é muito antigo. Ele existia bem antes do aparecimento do homem na terra. Quando o raio de sol atinge a área da praia ou calor de um bucão esquenta as rochas, a própria natureza se encarrega de fabricar pequenos pedacinhos de vidro. O homem ficou tão fascinado com a descoberta do vidro que foi inventando novas receitas para fabricar. E hoje o homem não pode viver sem o vidro. Ele está nos carros, casas, lâmpadas, televisores, prédios, pó, Embalar comidas, bebidas e remédios é uma especialidade do vidro, pois ele não passa gosto para os alimentos. A receita para fabricar vidro é simples. Primeiro, a mistura dos ingredientes. A leia, soda e cal. Essa mistura é levada ao forno super quente. A temperatura é de 1500ºC. A massa que sai do forno vai ganhar forma e ser moldada. A moldagem pode ser manual para fazer vários tipos de objetos. O outro jeito bem legal de dar forma ao vidro é o sopro. O vibreiro sopra massa através de um cano até formar uma bolha. A bolha é modelada com instrumentos para fabricar peças artísticas, lâmpadas ou garrafas. Mas a modelagem das garrafas do refrigerante que vocês bevem é feita com máquinas super modernas. Dá só uma olhada. Um porcento reciclado. Quer dizer que qualquer vidro pode ser reaproveitado para ser usado de novo em uma nova fabricação. Temperado? Se quebra sem sair do lugar. Assim eles não estilhaçam e não machucam ninguém. Prontinho, Dona Agumarsinda. Aí está seu vidro novo. Obrigada, Goto. Você foi muito legal. Pode deixar que eu pago a conta. Mas nada de bola, hein? Fique tranquila, Dona Agumarsinda. Este vidro é temperado. Uau! Que legal! Um vidro feito de fogo, areia, soda e cal. Que foi aquecido a mim. 1500 graus e foi esquentado, resfriado, moldado, temperado e transportado e vai deixar linda a janela da dona gomercinda e dar segurança para o adulto e para a criança. Nossa kika, de onde veio essa sabedoria tão sólida e transparente? Se eu contar você não vai acreditar. Um tchauzinho cristalino e até o programa que vem com mais um dia onde revés.","Kika, Kika, head to Kika, get a drink, and take care of Guto, get some water first. Hey, girl, but it's good to have a new glass, I can't take a cold drink. Hey, where's the glass? I saw it behind the balls. Good answer. But she didn't understand my question, Guto. But I understood, Kika. Who is it? My name is Kako. The glass is... I'll tell you where I came from. The glass is very old. It existed before the appearance of man on the earth. When the sun ray hits the beach area or the heat of a volcano, the natural prompt is carried out to make small pieces of glass. The man was so fascinated with the glass discovery that he invented new recipes to make it. And today, man can't live without glass. He is in cars, houses, lamps, TV, buildings, To pack food, drinks and remedies, it's a specialty of the food, because it doesn't go to taste for the food. The recipe to make glass is simple. First, the mixture of the ingredients. Almond, soda and cow. This mixture is taken to the super-heated oven. The temperature is 1500 degrees. The dough that comes out of the oven will gain shape and be molded. The molding can be manual to make various types of objects. Another very cool way to shape the glass is the glass. The glass is made of glass, through a pipe, to form a ball. The ball is modeled with tools to make artistic pieces, lamps or glasses. But the modeling of the glasses of the refrigerator that you drink is made with super-model machines. Just take a look. A recycled percent means that any glass can be reused to be used again in a new This is my future, Kika. I will still be recycled. My dream is to be a tempered glass. Tempered glass? A tempered glass is a very safe glass. It enters this hole and is heated to 600 degrees. Then it receives cold air jets. This temperature shock makes the glass much more difficult to break. The cables are made of laminated glass. If they suffer any impact, they will be broken. They break without leaving the place. So they don't get hurt and they don't hurt anyone. Ready, Mr. Nago-Mercinda. There's your new glass. Thank you, Goto. You were very cool. You can let me pay the bill. But nothing more than a ball, huh? Don't worry, Mr. Nago-Mercinda. This glass is awesome. Wow! How cool! A glass made of fire, sand, soda and lime. 1500 degrees and it was heated, cooled, molded, tempered and transported and will leave the window of Dona Gumercinda beautiful and gives security to the adult and the child. Wow Kika! Where did this wisdom come from so solid and transparent? If I tell you, you will not believe it. A crystal clear tea and even the program that comes with another day of revenge."

Finalmente esse dia chegou e daqui a pouquinho mais o sol já se põe a hora de comemorar do sábado. Hoje, no blog do Código Aberto, eu queria fazer assim um tipo de colagem de palavras. Aliás, o nome certo é compilação. Mas colagem de palavras é mais apropriado, porque o que eu vou fazer é juntar a beleza de uns textos garimpados aqui e ali nessas minhas palavras. O que eu vou ler, a partir de agora, são recortes de livros como esse aqui, ó. A história da redenção da escritora Ellen White. As declarações sem tanta cor e tanta beleza que eu não podia deixar de partilhar com vocês. Então, o primeiro pedacinho de texto que eu vou ler é esse. presença do grande criador e os incessantes raios da glória que cercavam o eterno Deus repousavam sobre ele. Todavia Cristo, o amado filho de Deus, tinha preeminência sobre todo o exército celestial. Ele era um compai antes do que os anjos fossem criados e Lúcifer envejou a Cristo, gradualmente pretendeu o comando que pétencia unicamente ao nosso Senhor. Lúcifer estava envejoso e insilmado de Jesus Cristo. Ele pensou em si mesmo como favorito entre os anjos do Ele declarou que os anjos não precisavam de lei, mas deviam ser livres para seguir a sua própria vontade, a qual os guiaria para sempre retamente. compreendendo caráter do Senhor, conhecendo-lhe a bondade, preferiu Satanás seguir a própria vontade independente e egoísta.

Today on the blog of the Code of Goabert I wanted to do this kind of collage of words, in fact the right name is compilation, but collage of words is more appropriate because what I'm going to do is to add the beauty of some garimpados texts here and there in these my words, what I'm going to read from now are records of books like this one here, the history of the redemption of the writer Ellen White, the declarations without so much color and so much beauty that I could not and I will let you share it with me. So the first piece of text I will read is this. Lucifer was jealous and envious of Jesus Christ. He thought himself as a favorite among the angels of the Church. God had been exalted, but it did not awaken him, he was praised and grateful to his Creator. He aspired to the height of God himself. But if God had exercised his power to put this tremendous rebel of the angels who began to think with Lucifer, they would never have been revealed. Therefore, God took another direction because he wanted to manifest distinctly to the entire celestial army his justice and judgment. Rebellize against God himself, rebelize against the government of God, it was a great crime. Satan was a real war. He declared that the angels did not need to read, but they should be free to follow their own will, which they would guide forever. He said that the law was a restriction to his freedom and that the abolition of the law was one of the great objectives of the position he took. They sinned in heaven and do the divine glory. He, as no other being created, revealed himself to the love of God. understanding the character of the Lord, knowing the goodness of it, preferred Satan to follow his own will, independent and selfish. This choice was decisive. There was nothing more that God could do to save him. Soon it will be Saturday. The Taj Mahal of God built in honor of you in the space of time. Take advantage and honor your Creator. Have this day closer to Him and this Saturday to be a happy day for you. Kisses and see you next time."

Sve pravo skrajno točko, naša parabola izgleda kole, to je skrajno točko, morate zračunati koordinati p i nq.","In front of us is a square line and our purpose is to use discriminants to find the parables of the stress-intensive force. First, d is b squared minus 4ac, our discriminant. These are our members a, b and c, as coefficients, The same as we can see in the previous video. So, we are counting here. First, 20 times 12. 20 times 24, 24 times 24. And we have 4 times 4. We can't forget. 4 times 4 is 8. 16 times 4 is 4. 1 is 25, 2 times 4 is 8 plus 20, so we have 1050 and when we have minus, that is minus 1050 and 2 minus is the data plus, so we can only put these two chains together, so we can put these two together and we have nothing, so 10, 9, 50, that is 5, So we will calculate x1 and x2. So we will calculate x1 minus b minus discriminant minus 2a. That's the formula. For x2, the formula is different in the same subject. So we have minus b plus discriminant minus 2a. So, we have minus 832 minus 7 data plus 830 minus discriminant to 2500. So, we give this under the root is 50. Let's try 50 times 50, we make 1520, nothing, 1520. So, 5 times 5, 1520, nothing, 5, 7, 2. I know myself as a Kralegard of the Moto, but that's all I know. It's nothing. And it's... eh. 2500. 50 is the correct answer. First we have minus, minus 50, then 2 times a. So 2 times 12 is minus 4 and 20. And for the first example, we have minus 12, minus 420 and this is one half. Here we have 830 plus 50, broken minus 420, the result will be negative. We have 830 plus 50, that is 8, 880, broken 420. If we divide this by 8, we get 1, if we divide this by 8, we get 3. We got two of our two nits. And because this is a square method, we easily draw it in the graph. So let's look at our graph. We have minus 12x squared minus 8 and 30x plus 2 and 20. It's easy to know that our parabola will be turned upside down, because the water coefficient is negative, that is, less than nits. I'll show you a little closer. We see that our So, 1.5 minus 1.3 is the first one, not the first one, not the whole one, so 1.5. The second one is minus 4, 1.3, 9.3 is 3, yes, minus 4. So, this is our parabola. and you can easily see the values of the subject. The end point, our parabola looks like this, this is the end point, you have to calculate the coordinates p and q."

Ya comienza, campo de precisión. Estos son los contenidos para nuestro programa de hoy. Nos encontramos con los amigos de Fairtech en la exposición rural de Palermo. En admite 2010 conversamos con la gente de clas que estuvo presente con su maqueta. Continuamos con la cobertura del curso de Agricultura de Precision visitando a los amigos de Planteo. Continuamos con nuestra cobertura de la exposición rural en donde visitamos a las empresas vinculadas a la agricultura de precisión que estuvieron presentes en la muestra de Palermo. Allí nos encontramos con los amigos de Fertec con quienes conversamos sobre los equipos que la empresa ofrece para la aplicación de precisión de fertilizantes y enmiendas calcarias. Luis Miguel Meineri, es mi nombre responsable sonar de la firma Ferti Tecnologías, SRL de Marcos Juárez. Nuestra empresa está ubicada al sureste de la provincia de Córdoba. Nuestros equipos fertilizadores marca Fertec, son para aplicación de fertilizantes sólidos, granulados y enmiendas calcarias. Equipos que van en capacidad de 3, 6 y 9 metros cúbicos. Estamos en Arrural, poniendo nuestros equipos, acompañando al productor con estos equipos de alta tecnología para aplicación de fertilizantes y bueno estamos muy contentos de estar un nuevo año en esta exposición que nos da gusto porque el productor nos respalda cada año que venimos acá. Bueno hoy en rural estamos presentando nuestro equipo Fertil 6000, un equipo que tiene mayor salida en el mercado dentro de nuestra empresa, equipo de 6 metros cúbicos de capacidad de tolva con la posibilidad de cargar hasta 8 toneladas de fertilizantes. Nuestros equipos están equipados con sistema de ossificación a cinta transportadora, cinta que recorre todo el fondo de la tolva y permite una eficiente dosificación en kilos por hectárea, con rangos que van de los 30 a 700 kilos en enmiendas granuladas y en lo que son polvos hasta 3500 kilos de aplicación por hectárea. Estos equipos tienen además un sistema de doble regulación en lo que es distribución para poder lograr una uniformidad en todo el ancho de trabajo que ronda en entre los 24 a 36 metros, dependiendo del tipo de fertilizante y las condiciones climáticas. Lo importante es que estos equipos, además, tienen una composición estructural índegamente abulonada, que permite otogar mayor flexibilidad en el tiempo y, además de tener tratamiento anticorrosivo, epoxy por dentro y por fuera, las partes del equipo pueden ser reemplazadas en el tiempo, en el caso de calle a corrosión, pueden ser reemplazadas por partes nuevas, pueden ser sacadas, pintadas y puestas nuevamente, incluso reemplazadas por hacer inoxidable. Además, nuestros equipos cuentan con la posibilidad de incorporar balanza electrónica que permite un control hectárea de la aplicación de fertilizantes para permitir en el transcurso del día y con la variación de la hidroscopicidad del fertilizante controlarlo en tiempo real. Por otra parte, también para otorgar un mayor beneficio al productor, los equipos posibilitan colocar computadora para hacer aplicación variable de fertilizante, equipos de alta tecnología que permiten también hacer variaciones en rangos muy altos y en tiempos muy breves. Al colocar una computadora de aplicación variable, solamente se modifica en una de sus partes, se quita la rueda de mando colocando un motor hidráulico que reemplace la misma lo que acciona la velocidad de la cinta transportadora para variar los kilos por hectárea. Nuestra firma también cuenta con un equipo exclusivamente para la aplicación de fertilizantes orgánicos, en el caso de cama de pollo, residuo de fildot, que a diferencia del sistema de La Cinta transportadora con la que cuentan los demás líneas de equipo cuenta con un sistema de cadena con dosificación proporcional al avance que permite aplicar altas dosis que van desde los 1000 a 14000 kilos por hectárea. También estos equipos están íntéramente agulonados. Por otra parte también la firma cuenta con equipos autopropulsados en una línea de 10.000 litros, 6.500 y 4.500 litros con diferente capacidad de motor en cada uno de estos equipos. Equipos de alta tecnología ya con la posibilidad de aplicación de fertilizantes y control en kilos por hectárea que permiten aumentar la autonomía y la capacidad de trabajo del productor agropecuario, inclusive contratistas. Por otra parte, en los equipos de línea de arrastre, equipos 6.000 y 9.000 litros, posibilitan la colocación de una barra exclusiva para encalado. Es una barra encaladora con un ancho de trabajo de 6 metros 15, que permite aplicar altas dosis de fertilizantes en polvo secos, inclusive húmedos con hasta un 20% de humedad, permitiéndole al productor aumentar la capacidad de trabajo en este tipo de enmiendas y efectivizar la aplicación y la disponibilidad del mismo sin pérdidas volátiles aplicando con una altura de 60 centímetros al suelo lo que permite al productor hacer una tarea eficiente. En el caso del sistema de barra para aplicación de polvos húmedos es un equipo que aumenta la salida en forma continua y día a día es el único equipo en el mercado con la posibilidad de aplicar polvo húmedo que permite al productor evitar las pérdidas volátiles del producto. De esta manera, nosotros estamos colocando equipos para lo que es aplicación y encalado en pasturas, recuperación de bajos salinos, inclusive para trabajos de presiembra en altas dosis de kilos por hectáreas. Inclusive la barra encaladora trabaja con el mismo sistema de dosificación que todos nuestros equipos, con la cinta transportadora que trabaja proporcionalmente al avance, independientemente de la velocidad, dosifica los kilos por hectárea. Al depositar el material en la barra, la barra trabaja con sin fines que depositan el material en todo el ancho y con regulación en orificio permite la caída uniforme en todo el ancho de trabajo. Esto le permite al productor, obviamente, como dije anteriormente, hacer un trabajo eficiente en toda la aplicación del producto. automático de secciones, banderillero y piloto automático. Ese box es de Plantium. En solo unos instantes nos volvemos a encontrar para continuar compartiendo campo de precisión.","Welcome! We invite you to share a program dedicated to disseminate the technologies and tools that allow us to improve the management and efficiency of our field. The field of precision begins. These are the contents for our program today. We meet with the friends of FerTech in the Rural Exposition of Palermo. In the mid-2010s we talked to the class agent who was present with his model. We continue with the coverage of the precision agriculture course visiting the plants friends. We continue with our coverage of the rural exhibition where we visit the companies linked to precision agriculture that were present in the Palermo sample. There we meet with the Fertec friends with whom we talk about the equipment that the company offers for the application of precision of fertilizers and calcareous mines. Luis Miguel Meineri, my name, the owner of the company Ferti Tecnologías, SRL of Marcos Juarez. Our company is located in the south-east of the province of Córdoba. Our Fertilizadores team is the Fertec brand, they are for solid fertilizers, granules and calcareous mines. Equipments that are capable of 3, 6 and 9 cubic meters. We are in Arrural, we are putting our teams, accompanying the producer with these teams of high technology for the application of fertilizers and well we are very happy to be a new year in this exhibition that we like because the producer brings us back every year that we come here. Well today in rural we are presenting our Fertil 6000 team, a team that has the largest output in the market within our company, a team of 6 cubic meters of torva capacity with the possibility of charging up to 8 tons of fertilizers. Our teams are equipped with a belt carrier system, belt that runs all the way through the bottom of the pole and allows a efficient dosage in kilo per hectare, with ranges ranging from 30 to 700 kilos in granulated mines and in what are dusts up to 3,500 kilos of application per hectare. These teams have also a double regulation system in what is distribution to be able to achieve uniformity throughout the entire work span, between 24 and 36 meters depending on the type of fertilizer and the climatic conditions. The important thing is that these teams also have a structurally integrated structure that allows you to give more flexibility in the time and in addition to having anti-corrosive treatment, epoxy inside and outside, the parts of the team can be replaced in the time, in the case of the corrosion layer, can be replaced by new parts, can be removed, painted and placed again, even replaced by stainless steel. In addition, our teams have the possibility of incorporating electronic balance, which allows for an hectare-hectare control of the fertilizing application to allow the variation of the fertilizing hydroscope in the day to be controlled in real time. On the other hand, to give a greater benefit to the producer, the teams can place computers to make a variable fertilizing application, high-tech teams that allow and also make variations in very high ranges and in very short times. When setting a variable application computer, it only changes in one of its parts, the wheel of command is removed, setting a hydraulic engine that replaces what acts as the speed of the transporter belt for varying the kilo per hectare. Our firm also has an exclusively for the application of organic fertilizers, in the case of chicken bed, fielder residue, which, unlike the system of The other lines of equipment have a chain system with a proportional dosage to the advance, which allows to apply high doses ranging from 1,000 to 14,000 kilos per hectare. These equipment are also entirely agulonated. On the other hand, the company also has self-propelled equipment in a line of 10,000 liters, 6,500 and 4,500 liters, with different engine capacity in each of these equipment. High-tech equipment, with the possibility of application of the equipment, of fertilizers and control in kilo-porectary, which allow to increase autonomy and the capacity of work of the agricultural producer, including contractors. On the other hand, in the line-of-draught teams, teams of 6,000 and 9,000 liters, they allow the placement of an exclusive bar for the bait, a bait bar with a 6.15 meter wide work, which allows to apply high doses of fertilizers in dry powder, even wet ones with up to 20% humidity, allowing the manufacturer to increase the work capacity in this type of miens and make the application and availability the same. Without volatile losses, applying at a height of 60 cm on the ground, which allows the manufacturer to do an efficient task. In the case of the system for the application of wet dust, it is a team that increases the output in continuous form day to day. It is the only team in the market with the possibility of applying wet dust which allows the manufacturer to avoid the volatile losses of the product. In this way we are setting equipment for what is the application and encased in pastures, recovery of saline bass, including for pre-siempre work in high dose and kilo-per-hectare. The encased bar even works with the same dosification system that all our equipment, with the transporter belt, which works proportionally at the advance, regardless of the speed, dosifies the kilo-per-hectare. When depositing the material in the bar, the bar works with no ends that deposit the material throughout the width and with regulation in the hole allows the uniform fall throughout the width of work. This allows the manufacturer, as I said before, to do an efficient work in the entire product application. automatic sections, vanderizer and automatic pilot. That box is from Plantium. In just a few moments we meet again to continue sharing precision field."

Hemos cambiado también el eje trasero. Los nuevos ejes traseros CAT en estas máquinas se caracterizan por tener un planetario exterior que facilita el servicio. Aquí tenemos otro par de cambios y estos son optativos en las máquinas de la serie E. Uno es el paquete de extensión del guardabarros que ayuda a mantener las ventanas limpias y el otro es un guardabarros delantero optativo para el tractor de la serie E. Este es un diseño de soporte simple que puede pedirse con la compra de la máquina o pedirse de fábrica. Ahora veamos algunos de los cambios que hemos hecho en el área del cargador de estas máquinas. Esta unidad es un porta-erramientas integral con el mismo diseño del porta-erramientas que teníamos en la serie D. Cada porta-erramientas viene con un acoplador rápido hidráulico para facilitar su cambio sin necesidad de herramientas especiales. Tanto en los porta-erramientas como en las máquinas simples, hemos hecho cambios en el área de la torreta del cargador para que sea un área plana, lo que proporciona mayor vida útil en las aplicaciones más exigentes. También tenemos un nuevo diseño de contrapeso en las máquinas de la serie E en toda la extensión del tractor. Es un tractor con un mejor balance que antes, ya que hemos extendido la base de la rueda en cerca de 5 pulgadas. Así que en general, vamos a necesitar menos contrapeso que en las máquinas de la serie D, pero aún tenemos el diseño de contrapeso justo como lo teníamos en los tractores de la serie D. También hemos hecho mejoras a los cucharones, específicamente a los de uso múltiple. Tenemos una nueva cuchilla de reemplazo del cucharón, de modo que si usted mira de frente el cucharón, puede ver esta cuchilla de desgaste reemplazable atrás en la sección dorsal, que va con la cuchilla de desgaste reemplazable en el borde delantero del cucharón para darle mejores opciones de servicio y mayor vida útil del cucharón. ahora al lado derecho de la máquina y veamos algunas mejoras que hemos hecho allí. Continúan las ventajas que había en las retroexcavadoras anteriores como la caja de batería aquí en el lado derecho con una puerta que abre muy fácilmente, no requiere herramientas especiales y se puede ver que aún hay espacio de almacenamiento para otras cosas como esta avaliza giratoria aquí en frente de las baterías. Esta máquina tiene dos baterías instaladas y puede llevar un paquete de baterías optativas para hacer pesado y también hay espacio si usted tiene el sistema de protección disponible en las máquinas de la serie e en donde la caja de protección también se encuentra","is a great advantage in the machines of the series E. We have also changed the rear axis. The new rear axes cut in these machines are characterized by having an external planetary that facilitates the service. Here we have another pair of changes and these are optional in the series E machines. One is the package of extension of the glass guard that helps to keep the windows clean and the other is a glass guard optional for the tractor of the series E. This is a simple support design that can be asked for with the purchase of the machine or ask for a factory. Now let's see some of the changes we have made in the area of ​​the charger of these machines. This unit is an integral tool carrier with the same design of the tool carrier that we had in the series of each tool carrier comes with a fast hydraulic coupler to facilitate its change without need for special tools. Both in the tool carriers and in the simple machines we have made in the area of ​​the charger's turret so that it is a flat area, which provides more useful life in the most demanding applications. We also have a new design of weight loss in the E series machines throughout the extraction of the tractor. It is a tractor with a better balance than before, since we have extended the wheel base in about 5 inches. So in general, we are going to need less weight loss than in the D series machines, but we still have the design of just like we had in the tractors of the series D. We have also improved the knives, specifically the multiple use ones. We have a new replacement knife of the knife, so that if you look in front of the knife, you can see this replacement knife back in the dorsal section, which goes with the replacement knife on the front edge of the knife to give it better service options and more useful life of the knife. Now we go to the right side of the machine and we see some improvements that we have done there. heavy service and there is also space if you have the system of protection available in the machines of the series e where the protection box is also found"

Mr. Rogers, tell us about practice three so far this week. How you've been fitting in. I know yesterday you said you've had your ups your downs. You've won some. You've lost some. How do you see yourself on the line right now? What are the O-line coaches told you technically when they've taken you aside and give you a little advice? What have they pointed up to you? Sometimes I take out too fast. Sometimes I need to slow down. I need to react more to them. Not always just so far back. Okay. Now we talked yesterday. You mentioned this down to two schools, Maryland, South Carolina. You're ready to do it. You make your announcement at the game. But have you heard yet when during the game you'll announce? No. with you. Okay, how much suspense and excitement is building up for you right now? I'm having a great time. I'm having a great time. I'm having a great time. I'm having a great time.

I'm having a great time. I'm having D. Lyman in particular jumped out to you saying wow that guy can play. Anyone caught your eye that you've had battles with? That's what Derwin said to you. What does he do? He's so fast. He's just fast all the time. When he gets off he's off. In your game, I know you're trying to play a little lower pad level. Talk about the final points of your game right now that you're honing in on. to a linebacker in space and I might be able to keep out that much and I might be able to miss the blocker and things. So I think he's going in space and being able to deal with speed rushing, that's part of my best work. OK, now I know you're roaming with Henry and you all talked about possible Big Ten battles to come. What's he told you about Michigan and what was your initial thoughts on Maryland joining the Big Ten? I mean, I thought it was a great move. The Big Ten is a better kind of football than the ACC. But I mean, for Maryland to go that's something that they want to improve. I'm going to go into a bigger stage and that's all we're going to do. And you and Durr and Yannick all went to the NBA game the other night. What's it like hanging out with those guys after just being pulled last week and not this game? I mean it's always cool. I remember hanging out with these guys about a week and a half and I was like, man it's been fun. We go places, most of the time we go to the camps and everything. Normally the best known dares and everything. So I kind of just sort of became friends with them. It's always cool. right now when you think Maryland, what do you think? As far as what they represent, where they are right now in your mind? Oh, I mean, it's a good school. The goodness of my cousin's staff and where I see myself fit in. How about South Carolina the same? South Carolina the same. The cousin's staff and me, they're having a good time there. Okay, so far, officially you've visited Maryland and Washington, unofficially South Carolina. I know you're announcing this week that you still have a visit January 18th playing for South Carolina. So but if you announce for another school this week, will you still take that visit? Okay, what's the? Okay, do you know yet in your mind where you're gonna go to school? No, you have not made that decision. I did. When do you think you'll make that like on the sideline before and tonight when you get a bed? Okay, and your mom's brought two hats down for you or you have some yourself? Okay, and so what how do you ramp up the soul experience? How's it been the recruiting process? It's been a long run for you. It's all fun. It's all fun. It's a great experience. Don't get to go to a lot. What do you think of the future of the Maryland program? I think it's over the last one. I mean, we're getting all these big guys coming in. I always think the Codetsu, the Flies, everybody's gonna be seeing the big one. Okay, and Duren, is he working hard this week down here? I mean, not so much, not so much. It was more of the chance to be a part of the now we're just out here having fun. We've heard it all from them.

Well, that's not usually the case. written by a professional staff led by a congressional researcher or a scholar. In this case, Canaan Hamilton came across the resume quite early on of Philip Zelikow, a very well respected historian at the University of Virginia. They contact him and Zelikow agrees to come on board. And he had served on the Blue Ribbon Commission investigating the 2000 vote that got Bush selected. Exactly. And he had earned the praise of both Republicans and Democrats on that commission. It's one of the commissioners from the Electoral Reform Commission who joins the 9-11 Commission and forward Zellico's name to Canaan Hamilton. And as I say, Zellico comes on board quite early. You talk about in your book the commission that's just being released this week, just being released today. Zellico's secret relationship with Carl Rove. He's this week becoming commentator on Fox News, but much more more relevant was his top status within the White House, top adviser to President Bush. and he had assured the commission that he would do his best to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest and would cut off most of these ties with his friends in the White House and elsewhere. It becomes known on the commission staff in 2003 that despite these promises, Zelikow is having conversations with of all people Carl Rove and this creates, as you might imagine, a huge amount of alarm and suspicion on the commission staff. What is the Executive Director of the 9-11 Commission doing talking to Carl Rove. Now, Rove's people at the White House, his friends and allies there and Zellico, insist that this was completely innocent and that this involved Zellico's work at the University of Virginia. And indeed, Zellico's work at the University of Virginia centered around presidential histories. So Carl Rove is somebody he would have normally at the university had some sort of contact with, I assume. And there's an odd development thereafter, which is Zellico calls in his secretary, shuts the door, and informs her that she is no longer to keep phone logs of his contacts with the White House. The secretary is alarmed by this, worries that she's being asked to do something improper, and then contacts the chief lawyer for the commission to alert him to what's happened. As I say, this whole sequence creates a great alarm and a great suspicion about what Zellico was up to. We're talking to Philip Sheenan. His book has just come out. It's called The Commission. His relationship, Philip Zellico's relationship with Condoleezza Rice. How far back does it go and what does it mean for the ultimate report that comes out? They have a relationship that goes way back. They were both members of the National Security Council staff in the first Bush administration, Bush 41, they formed a close friendship at that point. After that presidency, Zellico goes off to Harvard and Rice returns to Stanford. Yet they stay in touch and they write a book together about German reunification. After President Bush, 43, enters the White House, he sets up a transition team for the National Security Council at Rice's recommendation. task was being run on a day-to-day basis by somebody who was undeniably a very close friend of hers.","Let's talk about Philip Zellicow, the executive director of the 9-11 Commission.

These grants are part of a larger Recovery Act initiative totaling $500 million to fund workforce development projects promoting economic growth by preparing workers for careers in the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries. The investments will help American workers succeed while laying the foundation for our country's long-term competitiveness. Our green grants will support job training training and help workers, many in underserved communities, including veterans, women, youth, African Americans and Latinos. In addition, some $28 million of today's announcement will support projects in communities impacted by the restructuring of the auto industry. 25 projects across the country will receive grants ranging from $1.4 to $5 million each. activities funded under these programs will be individually tailored. They will also be based on both the jobs and skills that are identified to be most in demand in local areas across the country. We will look to prepare workers for a range of careers including hybrid and electric auto technicians, weatherization specialists, wind and energy auditors, and solar panel installers. These grants are built on strategic partnerships requiring labor and business to work together. Bringing together the expertise of these stakeholders will allow grantees to develop programs that harness and meet the needs of workers, businesses, and communities.

So that's your finished round bead. I'm just gonna take it off gently like this. Put it in a toothpick. You would brush it with the rest of the diamond glaze.

Slow growth for the United States region that we survey, of course, the stretching from North Dakota, Minnesota, and the North, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and the South, the leading economic indicator for the month of February is much like what we've been seeing. Sluggish, slowed, and no growth in the months ahead. Of course, we asked this month about sequestration, which of course is slated to go into of the supply managers said they expected the sequestration to have a negative impact on their sales or new orders. And of course, that's going to push things down even more. So this is an economy that's limping along at best. We've got, of course, higher fuel prices. We've got the increase in social security taxes that went into effect on January 1. So all this is pulling the regional economy down. And so we're going to have to go back to the economy. down overall and that's certainly pushing the national economy down. And looking at employment, even though it's above growth neutral, it's barely above growth neutral. Absolutely. And what we're looking at is unemployment rates are coming down, but some of that, a lot of it is because workers are getting discouraged and leaving the labor force. So the unemployment rate in all the states is looking better, but that, again, not for the right reasons. We're not seeing a real big expansion in employment. from the government numbers. And if you look at our numbers, which are of course much more timely coming out further month to February now, we won't get the February numbers for the U.S. economy until well, almost again, the March. But that said, the economy's not adding jobs at any sort of pace that we'd like to see. We're now seeing at least some of the companies are reporting that healthcare reform, they're already putting some workers hiring part-time instead of full-time because part-time workers will not qualify or are not mandated to receive health care health insurance from their employers. So we're seeing some of those that manipulation I would call it of employers to make sure they're not going to get hit by health care reform the mandates which hit on January 1st of 2014. Employers are building up their inventories in some respect and that is good but it may not last. That's right. The inventory numbers were up for the month and we asked them about sustainable purchases procurement and that's up fairly dramatically over the last two years. So that's good for the economy and it's good for the environment. Now unfortunately, some of the positive impacts are going to wane in the months ahead. If we don't see some real kickers here and that where would the kicker come from, a positive kicker that is, would be from exports. that right now. In fact, we saw the opposite exports down below growth neutral. And that's very troubling. Of course, that can be explained by what's not going on in Europe, some of the risk factors, Italy, for example, that's being spilling over into the overall economy. And of course, to quote Senator Alan Simpson from Wyoming, why is the stock market going up like it is? And everybody's wondering, Well, it's the healthiest horse in the glue factory. Everything is just not very strong out there. So a lot of investors are pouring into the US stock market even though in my judgment the risk are increasing and mounting. Certainly according to our survey, it's just not where the economy is just not expanding and that's going to have some negative impacts on the stock market going forward. But right now it's very positive. And with everything we're looking at in this report, it's not surprising that confidence is struggling. probably five months now, four to five months in a row we've seen an expanding housing market. That's affecting some of the economies that some of the states that we survey, the economies in those states. And you know, Cindy, one thing that's important here is agriculture of course is very, very important for this part of the country. That's still looking very good. For example, the numbers in Iowa are very strong and that's companies tied to agriculture doing very well even as the economy struggles. Now agriculture and energy, that would be of course ethanol in this part of the country, a lot of it, except North Dakota where you're seeing some really good numbers in terms of energy and agriculture. So that's very positive, very good for the economy. But now on the flip side, those organizations that are tied to the livestock producer, livestock's not as strong, but it's more crops than those tied to crops. For example, Amin Sano, other producers that are tied to agriculture doing pretty well. In summary, it's just sluggish growth ahead. There is the ever, I won't say ever, not a certain possibility, but there is the possibility of getting negative numbers in the months ahead because GDP growth for the final quarter of the US was one-tenth of one percent. That's nothing, one-tenth of one percent, and that's annualized. We should be growing at three to four to five percent. percent right now will not and the job numbers that will be accompanying that in the month's head at least according to our survey, it's going to be slow to no growth in jobs. Certainly some sectors will be adding jobs and that would be primarily those tied to agriculture right now, those businesses tied to agriculture doing pretty well. Some export sectors, now that would be few of them, overall export numbers not good but some sectors of the export time those Tydex exports will do better.","Ernie, looking at this month's report, it decreased slightly and it looks like it's indicating slow growth in the months ahead.

I'm fortunate to be here. And it's always good to work out with Chris Paul and someone like that. Hi, Chris Wright, I love him. What do you think about going against Chris Paul in this camp, getting to learn from him, getting to play against him? I mean, Chris Paul is art to the best one garden in the world.

How are you going to replace him and be able to compete in the Big East this year? You're not worried about competing. We're trying to win the Big East. Replacing Greg is... You can't replace a player of that caliber. You know, potential, future, top 10 pick. It's tough to replace that. What we kind of do is we do it by committee. We still have me and Austin returning. and along with Jason Clark along with Julian Bond. So we still have four starters returning and we just got to do it by committee and pick up the score and myself and also pick up the score a little bit. And just play hard, play scrappy, and we'll figure out the rest.

We go to our territory and we go to the movies. How do you select these films? Or these films? Why? Well, the selection was bigger and then we went away, let's say, the films that did not fit our styles, the ones that seemed the most, that were our films. It was a beautiful process. We always discovered a new one. And this song is very beautiful. As a musician, I was looking for it. I tried to find another wonderful song. Was there a research process? It's a very interesting song, as you can hear it in the movie."

Et c'est d'autant plus efferrent que parmi les victimes, il y avait 11 garçons et 7 filles âgées de 14 à 23 ans. Lorsque j'ai fait l'étude des causes qui avait conduit à ces suicides. J'en a relevé un certain nombre, par exemple des jeunes qui venaient de foyer séparés, divorcés, d'autres qui avaient connu des traumas familiaux, d'autres qui avaient connu des difficultés scolaires. Mais le seul élément qui revenait dans les 18 cas, et je tiens à le dire, c'est que les 18 jeunes en question écoutaient en moyenne de la musique rock'n'roll, plus de 5 heures par C'est ce qui m'a mis sur la piste en demandant aux parents de victimes de me passer les albums de musique que ces jeunes écoutaient. Et lorsque j'ai fait l'analyse du contenu, je trouvais bizarre que les 18 écoutaient le même genre de musique. Et j'ai dit quand même, ça peut pas expliquer que ça pousse au suisse. Il faut qu'il y ait autre chose. C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai pris connaissance de recherche qui avait été faite par le Pasteur Greenwald. Et je me suis mis à faire l'analyse des disques et j'ai découvert qu'il y avait en renversé un message masqué. Ce message masqué qui a pour effet décité les jeunes soit au meurtre, soit à la violence, soit au suicide, soit à l'usage de la drogue, soit encore à toute forme de violence. mon père vous dit que dans la musique rock'n'roll il y a des musiques, il y a un message inversé, un message qu'on entend qui ne sont pas les paroles même de la chanson mais c'est des paroles surajoutées c'est absolument vrai. Je pense que c'est un phénomène qui a été mis en lumière et en popularité par les Beatles qui ont été les premiers à se faire servir de façon mais une fois le principe établi, on a suivi la mode en ajoutant des messages de plus en plus directs et en ajoutant aussi des messages de plus en plus longs. Alors pour nous faire comprendre un peu de quoi il s'agit, peut-être qu'on pourrait écouter ensemble trois exemples très clairs d'implantation de messages subliminaux qui sont contenus dans les disques mais en rendant Alors pendant que nous écoutons ces trois exemples, nous pouvons regarder en même temps ce fameux album de l'adiple. Maintenant que vous avez entendu la version normale, voici en renversé le message subliminal qui est très facile d'entendre. La musique est réversible, mais le temps ne l'est pas. Je dois vivre pour Satan. car c'est à partir du moment précis de la pollution de cette chanson que les messages subliminaux furent intégrés dans la production des disques Rock and Roll. À l'endroit, vous entendrez la répétition sans fin de Le message subliminal que vous entendrez en version renversée est le suivant. John Lennon se fera le porte-parole du groupe lors de la présentation publique du Devil's White album. sur ce que j'ai raison. L'histoire démontrera que j'ai eu raison. Présentement, nous sommes plus populaires que Jésus-Christ. Je me demande bien ce qui disparaîtra en premier le rock'n'roll ou le christianisme. En d'autres termes, il proclame que Jésus-Christ est mort et ontérit. Seul survit et triomphe de rock'n'roll. avec les exemples. Mais comment faites-vous pour arriver à extraire d'un disque qui joue dans un sens le message qui est inclus lorsqu'on tourne le disque dans l'autre sens? Et enfin, si c'est relativement simple sur un plan technique, sauf dans le cas des disques de Arcee Osburn parce qu'il a utilisé une technique autre que nous expliqueront tout à l'heure. Mais au départ, nous enregistrons simplement le disque à l'endroit sur une bande magnétique et ensuite nous transférons la bande magnétique que nous faisons jouer à l'envers et là les paroles sortent très clairement. Et quand on se sert un filtre equaliser, eh bien ça enlève la densité de la musique pour isoler de façon plus claire les paroles que nous entendons. Mais les paroles qui ont été particulièrement incitatives de meurtres ont été dans le disque Blondé, du groupe Blondé, où on entend très spécifiquement, mais dans le disque, et qui est très connu, il est dit, voici que je me tourne vers l'ouest et que mon esprit aspire en criant pour partir. l'ouest, c'est-à-dire du côté opposé du soleil, et bien c'est un argage isotérique. Celui qui chante cette chanson préconise que pour sortir de la misère et pour trouver son ciel, il n'y a qu'une façon logique et pratique c'est de se suicider soi-même. I've got to live for Satan. Je dois vivre pour Satan et pour pouvoir vivre avec lui, le suicide est le moyen de plus rapide.","But the real reason that pushed me to write this study on the subliminal message is that I was confronted in a few months' time by 18 suicide cases. And it's even more terrifying that among the victims there were 11 boys and 7 girls aged 14 to 23 years old. When I did the study of the causes who had led to suicide. I have raised a certain number, for example, of young people who came to see these by the divorcees, others who had known family traumas, others who had known school difficulties. But the only element that came back in the 18 cases, and I want to say it, is that the 18 young people in question were listening to the rock and roll music for average more than five hours a day. It's what put me on the track, asking victims' parents to pass me the album of music that these young people listened to. And when I did the analysis of the content, I found it strange that the 18 of them listened to the same type of music. And I said, it can't explain that it pushes the suicide. There is something else. It's at that moment that I got to know a research that was done by the Greenwald pastor. I analyzed the records and discovered that there was a masked message in reverse. This masked message could have incited young people, either to murder, violence, suicide, drug use, or any form of violence. My father tells you that in the Rock and Roll music, there is a message that we don't hear the lyrics of the song, but the lyrics are added. It's absolutely true. I think it's a phenomenon that has been put into light and popularity by the Beatles. They were the first to be able to serve in a way specific. But once the principle is applied, we have followed the fashion by adding more and more direct messages and by adding more and more long messages. So to make us understand a little bit what it is, maybe we could listen together three very clear examples of subliminal messages implanted, which are contained in the disks but in Now that you have heard the normal version, here is the subliminal message that is very easy to hear. The music is reversible, but time is not. And here is now the subliminal message in reverse version. because it is from the precise moment of the production of this song that the subliminal messages were integrated into the production of the Rock'n'Roll records. In the end, you will hear the repetition of The subliminal message that you will hear in the inverted version is the following. Translating this means, exit me sexually, or die. And the death in question is Jesus Christ. John Lennon will be the spokesperson of the group during the public presentation of the Devil's White album. I have reason. History will demonstrate that I had reason. Currently, we are more popular than Jesus Christ. I wonder what will disappear first, the Rock and Roll or Christianity. In other words, they proclaim that Jesus Christ is dead and buried. Only triumph and triumph of Rock and Roll. Father Jean-Paul, these ebony messages are contained in your little book, the Rock and Roll. with the examples. But how do you get to the end of a disc that plays in a sense, the message that is included when you turn the disc in the other direction? It is relatively simple on a technical level, except in the case of the discs of O.C. Osburn, because he used a technique other than what we explained earlier. But at the beginning, we simply record the disc and then we transfer the magnetic band we play to the other side and the words come out very clearly. And when we use an equalizer filter, it removes the density of the music to isolate the words we hear more clearly. But the words that have been particularly incitative of murder have been very clear. We find ourselves in the band's Blondet album, where we hear very specifically, Diane Dye Pretty, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. Even in the album, The Way to Heaven, which we hear and which is very well known, it is said, here I turn to the west and my spirit breathes in, crying, to leave. the west, that is to say the opposite side of the sun, well it is an esoteric language. The one who sings this song, he says that to get out of misery and to find his heaven, there is only one logical and practical way to commit suicide. I've got to live for Satan. I have to live for Satan. And to be able to live with him, suicide is the fastest way."

The Saudi state was, thank God, the one who brought the invitation to all the people of Al-Jazeera. He reached all of them, all of them from Islam. Then, in the second Saudi state, the Imam Tarky Ibn Abdullah led the second The people of Saudi Arabia called upon them and their country The people of Saudi Arabia, a call and a state. We will take the Masjid of the Prophet and the Medina of the Monawwara. And we will lead the duty, insha'Allah. And we will be a group with a human understanding of the nature of the soul. The worship of Islam is the most important thing in life. And what is after that is the joy of life, the joy of it. And she said to our Lord, in this world, it is better. And in the Hereafter, it is better. And we will be punished by the fire. Because the call to Allah and the spread of knowledge and goodness has not been achieved except through His protection, the leaders of the order have been entrusted to Allah, to meet the scholars and the supplications in many of the appropriate ways.

I explain about making NN-XT Patches from scratch, which is actually really useful.   I don't use automation because automation is a faff when all you want is a quick sweet snare roll.  If you have a tutorial request just send it my way either here or on my website http://www.boyinaband.com - I have had tons of requests lately though, so I've started doing commissioned tutorials which take priority, again, check my website for details :)  If you make anything with this patch, post it as a video response!

This is a useful quick tutorial that will show you how to use the NNXT sampler with non-pitched samples. I find this is a much easier way to accomplish the effect than with automation as many other people use this technique. Okay, so I'll just play you the beat I've made here. Let's get to work. I'll just mute the existing one. I'll make one from scratch. Right-click, Combinator, because we're going to store all the devices we're using in a Combinator. Right-click, inside the Combinator, create nnxtAdvancedSampler. This is the sample we're going to use to trigger the sample. remote editor. And here you can see the samples being used for the default patch, the ground piano, to multi-sample that. So we want to get rid of these. So right click, initialize patch, and that completely clears it out. So we want to put our own sample in here now. So in the sample column, right click and click add zone. Now it comes up with this no sample and this bar here which defines which note will trigger this sample. So we want to add a sample in now. So double click where it says no sample and find the sample you want to use which you'll be able to find on my website this 808 snare and you can actually hear this now if I move across the notes from the other effect. Should be able to hear the pitch now. There we go. And that's pretty much the effect. I've just right click, create compressor, I've just compressed it to bring up the level to a more consistent level and that's turning the threshold and the ratio to full and add a reverb effect as well just to just to make it sit in the mix a bit better but not too much so just down there really on the dry wet knob. Okay and that's that's how you make the actual unit and I'll just show you what I've done in the sequencer window for this And it's just a case of adding in different notes at different pitches. Here it comes. And that's it. That's how you make your pitched snare roll. Sweet!

In this video we delivered Oaks Parcel and caught our second team member.    I will be recording more so stay tuned!    New Pokemon That Appeared In This Episode    Rattata - A normal type, not that good for a main team, but if you wanna be unique, use it. I've used it before, it wasnt horrible but it wasn't all that good either. Only reccomended for experts.     Pidgey - A normal and flying boss. Its bulkier than Fearow, but it doesn't have as much oomph as the Spearow family. However, very good choice for beginners and vetarans alike.    Mankey - A fighting type. Great attack, fastest fighting type in the game. Honestly, its a beast. This thing can tear through teams.    Spearow - Its got a bit more kick than Pidgey, but its not as bulky. Its pretty frail but can be a good choice if used correctly.    Weedle-Caterpie - Bug types, bug types, bug types. Yes, the underated bug types. Caterpie (when fully evolved into Butterfree) is a good support Pokemon with its status moves and Weedle (as a Beedrill) is a bit better in Offensive terms, it can be very good or very bad.    Pikachu - Yes, you all know Pikachu im sure. The elecric mouse. Good attacking stats, bad defenses, and fast. This thing is a pretty good choice for an electric type, but if your patient, get Magneton, in the aspect that it is better for sweeping and what not.","Pokémon FireRed And LeafGreen, pokemon fire red, walkthrough, lets play, pokemon leaf green",394,3,1,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/W0cK-zhCyfU.mp3,"Hey guys, we're back to some more Pokemon Leaf Green version. In the last episode we started up the game and we got our starter Pokemon here Bulbasaur and I really reckon I was right about the nature. Raises speciality and lowers physical attack so that's a really good nature on Bulbasaur. But yeah in the last episode we just got our starter and took down our rival. So in this episode we are going to I'm not guessing that you guys mind that much. Catching it. It's like a legendary or something No reason to hill up. So yeah, this is what normal city in the game looks like but Pokemon centers and random houses the gym of course up there and Every town's a Pokemon mark. So we're gonna head inside and this dude says, you know, professor of right? I'm I need you to take this to him. So he gives us Oaks parcel So we have to deliver this to him. So yeah jumping on the ledges makes it a lot easier to get back, but yeah We can cut down back into round one. And yeah, and if you didn't mention this right, you can really only find Rattath and Pidgeys from level 2 to level 5. That's a 2 special here. You can catch them right after you go into the lab here. Especially if we give you some Pokeballs. Casual Pokemon will seem to be growing, not that much. Um, so yeah, we delivered the parcel and... It's custom Pokeball, it had it in order. Thank you. Great! It was like, what? I don't wanna figure out what you call me for. Oh right I have a request for you two. On my desk here's my vetching of Pokedex. Don't remind me of course that on Pokemon you've seen and or caught. It's a high-tech and thoughtful medium. DG, Kyle, take these with you. I'm gonna start doing voices for each character. Cause kinda like a purple Rodriguez. I actually think it's kinda funny. You must catch them to obtain complete data. So here are some tools for catching wild Pokemon. Here's your 5 Pokeballs. When a wild Pokemon appears, it's a fair game. Just throw a Pokemon out there and try to catch it. This won't always work, however. Healthy Pokemon can escape and have to be lucky. We can complete God and all the Pokemon in the world. That was my dream. Oh, that's why they created Pokemon guidebooks. Anyways, from the tool, I can't get the job done. So, I want you to do... To do... I want you to go fulfill my dream for me. It will be you too. This is a great undertaking in Pokemon history. I'm not the one you want. Haha. Don't bother coming to my place to rap this. That's always just how I imagine it to sound like. Just like a big jerk face like, yeah, I'm gonna get a town map. But anyways, I don't have a voice this is annoying me already. Even though I don't really ever need a town map, just because I know the game's so well already. I'll just get one just for sake of completion. So yeah, since we delivered the parcel now we got our pokeballs. If we wanted to we could catch a pokeball. Which I... um... I do. Not sure about that. and yeah she's a really good Pokemon I love to use it so yeah we caught Pidgey so there we go Pidgey, common sign of force and one that flaps its wing at ground level to kick up Blending Sand that's cool give it a nickname I can think of a nickname here um we'll call her see what should we call her we'll call her tornado I think that's a pretty cool name it kinda like makes sense for a flying type So yeah, that's it for round one. And I was gonna run in the Pokemon Center real quick. And we're back. So yeah, since we're going to go heal up, if you guys want to, you can go down here and battle your rival. The wild Pokemon over here are Manki and Sphero and Rattatapid, and all that stuff. Now if you walk up here, you can find a potion. So that's cool. I'm gonna do some training a bit later. Offscreen. So up here this guy will teach you how to catch a Pokemon. I'm just gonna cut this out because I'm sure you guys already know. So yeah. And we're back. So yeah, so stick this to Teach TV. I got the key items. And it'll teach you the basics with the Pokemon trainer. So yeah, that's kinda cool I guess. I'm gonna why he's using me to catch one Pokemon like I clearly already caught one Speaking of which, let's check out tornado here has a gentle nature Forget what that does, but okay actually maybe I can tell by stats Let's see that looks like high special attack and low physical defense. So, you know, I'll be right back. I say I want to check that out. Oh Well, I was wrong actually it raises up special D in lowers physical D. So that's actually pretty good Considering Pidgey's more weak to special attacks like as far as weaknesses go. Right here you can get a bunch of stuff like Weedle and Caterpie and you know, other basic Rattach Pidgey. I'm only really gonna name up the new Pokemon. And I will probably be listing them in the description. Yeah, it's a new thing I'm gonna be doing. I was just gonna start in this episode. I'm gonna like give them a quick description of the Pokemon that you can find here. Just so you guys can like see what I think about them. And we're not gonna go through the Verdean Forest today. I don't think we have time to get to the whole thing. So yeah, but here you can find Caterpie, Weedle, Metapod, Kuna, and Pikachu along, which is an electric tape. A lot of people like Pikachu. A lot of you guys thought I was gonna catch Pikachu, but I'm actually not. I have different plans for an electric tape. So yeah, like there's a lot of other good electric types in this game like Jolteon, Magneton, Electrode, Electabuzz. So yeah, Pikachu is just not really my style. I use it way too much. So yeah, so we're not gonna head into the Verdeen Forest today. We'll be definitely doing that in the next episode. So yeah. But yeah, I'm sorry we didn't really do too much in this episode, but at least we delivered the parcel and we caught a couple more of that stuff. So yeah, that's actually gonna be it for this episode. I know it was a pretty short episode, but hey, yeah, abrupt ending.","Hey guys, we're back to some more Pokemon Leaf Green version.

Momentan wenig Zeit dafür habe erstens Videos hochzuladen und zweitens auf eure PNs einzugehen. Dann momentan sieht das so aus, dass ich ein Praktikum habe und es auch jetzt absolut wiehre 11 Wochen lang. Das heißt 11 Wochen lang bin ich von 9 Uhr morgens bis 17.30 Uhr unterwegs, dann noch eine Stunde nach Hause fahren. Also bin ich so um 18 Uhr 30 immer zu Hause und da bleibt wenig Zeit übrig da irgendwie was zu machen. Eigentlich besteht dann die Hauptzeit daraus Essen zu jagen, draußen wie zum Beispiel Kinder die laut sind oder daraus zu schlagen. Was hab ich denn noch zu erzählen? Ich hab jetzt ein Stativ für die Kamera, das heißt ich muss meine Arme nicht mehr heben. Ich so das so nicht hin kann. Aber dann zu komm' ich später. Zuerst erzähle ich euch mal was anderes und zwar hab ich mir eine Wii gekauft. Mit meinem Bruder eigentlich. Der hinter mir liegt in einer erotischen Pose, die ihr leider nicht sehen könnt und mir leid. Außer das Stativ fällt runter. Und das sieht ziemlich wackelig aus. Auf jeden Fall haben wir jetzt eine Wii und ja, das erste Mal zocken sah ein bisschen komisch aus, weil ich etwas überfordert war mit den ganzen Steuerungen. Okay, okay, okay. Ja, auf jeden Fall macht es sehr viel Spaß da, rumzufuchteln, ist etwas Neues für mich und bis jetzt gab es auch nur zwei Schwerverletzte. So, und jetzt kommen wir mal zu der Einsache, die verursacht hat, dass ich meine Arme nicht befinden kann, außer beim Weed-Zocken. Beim Zocken kann man immer alles bewegen, auf einem Rollstuhl sitzt und total vergibst ist. Man kann immer zocken. Immer. Verdammt noch mal immer. Ich hab zwar keine Ahnung ob das eine Pilotenbrille ist und die jetzt zum Thema passt, aber auf jeden Fall war sie ein Kinderüberraschungs-Ei dabei und ich war in Botrop. Skydiving Indoor Skydiving Ich empfehle alle 50 bis 90 jährigen. Ich bin jetzt nicht so wirklich. Also wenn es wichtige PNs sind schickt es mir jetzt nochmal bitte. Ich werde ab jetzt versuchen auf die einzugehen. Und ich bedanke mich auch bei allen PNs die geschrieben haben, hey du bist toll und mach weiter so du bringst mich zum lachen. Das freut mich sehr und motiviert mich auch natürlich weiter zu machen. Vielen Dank. Bevor das Video jetzt aber endlich zu Ende geht stelle ich mich erstmal ganz cool an die Seite hier, weil das ist richtig cool. Die Brille ziehe ich jetzt nicht an, weil sonst würde alles gefrieren automatisch. funktioniert. Auf jeden Fall habe ich die letzten Tage in einigen Videos mitgespielt unter anderem beim Dietmar Schwarz Hate Man Video. Ich wusste ja nicht, was mich gefilmt haben. Die haben hier irgendwo Kameras aufgestellt und der Dietmar, ja, der Dietmar der wird mich besuchen, weil ich habe nicht mehr lange zu leben und deswegen verabschiede ich mich jetzt, falls das der letzte Vlog ist, aber die ziehen das echt durch. Das Video habe ich unten verlinkt. Genauso wie ein tolles Best of, das ich unten verlinkt habe vom, vom der Und ein Rekogamer, ähm, es hat mich zum Wein gebracht. Denn es ist ausnahmsweise mal kein Amnesia. Kein Best of to Amnesia. Ja, er hat gesehen, dass ich auch noch andere 20 Projekte habe neben Amnesia. Ja, wie zum Beispiel 4-1. Dazu hat er ein kleines Best of gemacht. Ich muss da nicht die lachen. Ich habe mich sehr gefreut darüber. Wie gesagt, ich habe geweint, aber natürlich, weil ich Zwiebeln geschnitten habe nebenbei. Und ein Sandsturm plötzlich aufgetaucht ist. Hm. Und ein Hundewelpe. Schaut euch an, ist unten verlinkt. Ähm, er lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Outtakes! Outtakes! Warum nicht? Wenn es auch nur 10 Zuschauer sind, Hauptsache 10. 1000! Und ja, wir sehen uns dann demnächst wieder. Hab noch eine schöne Woche. Tschüss. Ist das Ding an? Da laufen kleine Kinder rum. Er schießt sie. Wir haben es sofort mit dem Film. Er schießt sie sofort. Ich kann sie nicht arbeiten. Ich kann sie nicht arbeiten. Tschüss. Okay. Nein, Frau darf ich. Auf jeden Fall bekomme ich das.

I have a practicum and I am from 9 am to 3 pm. I am at home at 8 am and I have little time to do something. I will try to upload projects that are not regular. I don't have much time. I will record a lot of them. The other problem is that I don't know what to play. Now Max Payne. That's cool. It will be played if I get it. Until then, come other games. What else do I have to say? I have a tripod for the camera, so I don't have to lift my arm anymore. I can't go back like this. But then I'll come later. First I'll tell you something else, and I bought a Wii. With my brother, who is behind me in an erotic pose, which you can't see, sorry. Except that the tripod falls down. And it looks pretty ugly. In any case, we now have a Wii and yes, the first time playing was a bit weird because I was a bit overreacting with the whole control. Just one short time. I played against my cousin, my 4 year old cousin. What was that? Super Smash Bros. I got to get to know him properly. It was very funny to map him afterwards. In real life. And how it looked like? I'll show you now. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. The game had already started. Yes, it's definitely a lot of fun to tell around there. Something new for me. And so far there were only two serious injuries. So now let's go to the one thing that caused me to not be able to move my arms. Except when we play. When playing you can always move everything. Even if you sit in a wheelchair and are totally lost. You can always play. Always. Damn it again. I have no idea if it's a pilot glasses and that fits the topic now. But in any case it was a surprise in the children's room. And I was in BOT ROP. Skydiving. Indoor skydiving. For those who don't know what that is, it's like jumping on the wrong jump, but indoor. So indoor, you have to swim, so to speak. You swim around. That's like you would turn the towel around and then swim. And I tell you, that looked so sexy and professional. Do you know how? Like this. In any case, you can no longer see me, that I'm 44 years old, because the folds are gone. I recommend all 50 to 90 years old. If you have this then you get a super diploma. Here again. In the skydiving. In the board drop. Wait. Yes, there is something in there. For example, has the flight instructions ignored? Was aggressively against the instructions. Can super great fly, can make pirouettes. Yes, here is a great photo of me. I look like four years. I don't really see myself. Wait a minute. What? What do you think of this? What kind of diploma does this have? I don't know. Probably I'm an official pilot or something. If you're going to fly to the Urlaub next, it could be that I'm a pilot. That was all important topics I wanted to address. So I'm going to upload this. Unfortunately, it's not going well because I'm on the road all day. It's going to be a bit of a mess. PNs, I'm sorry I can't answer that. If it's important, send it to me again. If you send me important P1s, please send me again. I will try to get into them from now on. And I thank you for all the P1s who wrote me. Hey, you're great and keep doing it. You bring me to laugh. I'm very happy and motivated to continue. Thank you very much. Before the video ends, I'll put myself on the side first. Because that's really cool. I don't turn on the glasses now, otherwise everything would freeze automatically. I did the last few days in some videos. Among other things, when I was filming the Deedman Black Hate Man video. I didn't know that I filmed it. They put some cameras on here. And Deedman is going to visit me soon. I don't have a long life left. That's why I'm going to say goodbye now. If that's the last vlog. But they're really pulling it through. I linked the video down below. Just like a great best of. That I linked down below. I'm a Riko Gamer, it brought me to wine, because it is not Amnesia at all. He has seen that I have another 20 projects next to Amnesia. Yes, like 4-1 for example. He has made a little best of it. I have to laugh, I'm very happy about it. I cried, but of course because I cut onions next to it, a sandstorm suddenly appeared and a dog world. Check it out, it's linked below. It's funny. Another video I did with the good Lord Tord or with the Magical Relive. I don't know, the two channels because he can't get enough of himself. Really, really, the two channels. Me too, but that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. I definitely called him in three different languages and you can watch that. It's very funny. I also recommend watching the video all the way to the end. If you don't like the first part, it can be. There are great episodes. No, why not? If it's only 10 viewers, I mean 10. 1000! And, yeah. We'll see each other again next time. Have a nice week. Bye. Is that the thing? There's a little kid around. He shoots her. You shoot her with the film. He shoots her right away. I can't work like that. I can't work like that. Bye. Okay. No, I can do it. I'll definitely get... No, I've already got it last time. I'll definitely get it at the beginning of every sentence. I'll definitely let it go. Definitely. What would I say? And I'll tell you, that looks like something from Sexy and Professionnel. That's still under us. Okay, I'll start now. The turbine. For you, this... Fuck. Skydiving? Indoor skydiving. So now nothing. So now we come to the thing that caused me to... So now we come to the one thing. You can move your socks. Even my... Okay."

I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan. And when Our clear Signs are recited to them, those who do not wish to meet Us say, They will be pleased to meet, or to come to the Qur'an without it, or to replace it. Say, What is it that I should replace it with the one that I myself have, if I follow except what is revealed to me? I fear, if I am disobeyed, my Lord, the punishment of a great day. And they will not be able to recognize you with it. So I have already dressed you with a veil before it. So do you not understand? So who is more unjust than one who has created a lie against Allāh or has denied His signs? Verily, He does not succeed the criminals. And they worship other than Allāh, what does He harm them and does not benefit them, and they say, And they say, These are the intercessioners of our own with Allāh. Say, Do you tell Allāh about what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth? Glory be to Him! And come to Him above what they associate with Him. And it was not the people except a single nation, so they differed. And they say, If a sign from his Lord had not been sent down to him, then say, The unseen is only for Allah. Then wait, I am with you from the One who is waiting. They will be destroyed when they have a grudge in Our Signs. Say, Allah is the fastest grudge. Indeed, Our messengers are writing what you are hiding. There came a wind of dust and a rain of rain from the place. And they thought that they were surrounded by them. They called upon Allāh, the sincere ones, for Him is the religion. If We had saved them from this, we would surely be among the grateful. We have come to it, and made it a treasure, as if you did not touch it. Thus, the signs are explained to a people who think. And Allah is the Most Merciful, and He wills a straight path. We used to be with the blessing of the blessed, to the village of Sheikh, the author of the Siddique."

Sì, buonasera Michele. Una serata freddissima, ha piovuto a dirotto. Il Bari ha affrontato, come dicevi tu, il primo testa e ha sfidato la formazione locale, quella della Val Ridanna, in condizioni veramente, veramente a limite della praticabilità. Comunque, il Bari ha giocato bene, il Bari ha vinto 16 a 0, addirittura, all'onore di Cronaca. Si sono già visti i primi miglioramenti da parte degli uomini di Conte. di Cos'altro ci parlerà questa sera sinteticamente. Allora, una brutta notizia. Oggi si è fatto male in maniero, quindi abbiamo intervistato maniero, abbiamo chiesto al calciatore come stava insomma. E poi abbiamo sentito anche il centrocampista Rivas che ha giocato benissimo oggi. Lo vedremo nelle immagini che vi proporemo tra poco. E allora facciamo un salto. Cos'altro ci puoi aggiungere? Ricchiele, ha aperto le danze cavalli, Simone Cavalli, ma devo sottolineare la bellissima prestazione di Bianco che il salto unico calciatore a giocare tutti i novanta minuti e poi una prestazione veramente da sottolineare quella di Buon Vissuto che ha segnato sei reti ma vediamo le queste reti. Dovrebbe partire. Dovrebbe partire. Anche se non si tratta di una gara ufficiale questo di cavagli il primo gol stagionale del bari. I bianco rossi hanno sfidato la rappresentativa locale della Varridanna. Si tratta del primo testa giornale per gli uomini di Conte. Curiosità per la formazione scese in campo dal primo minuto anche se il tecnico Salentino giura di essersi affidato. la casualità. sentito vediamo subito il contributo che c'è riversato maniera un infortunio alla caviglia destra qui in allenamento come è andata sono e poi vediamo l'esito della gaviglia, come se si gonfia o meno. Prevemente, ci sono novità inserata sulle condizioni di maniero? diciamo alle visite mediche quindi non c'è nessuna novità però abbiamo parlato con al conte ha detto che la situazione non è così grave per cui buone notizie insomma. Una curiosità Michele, una curiosità chiedo scusa e si è fatto male in maniera si è fatto male anche bianco loro due sono compagni di squadra quindi in maniera ha detto non vorrei che fosse la stanza a portare male. Una piccola curiosità insomma. Vogliamo credere. Vogliamo conoscere meglio il centro campis Tarivas che ha assegnato anche questo oggi e suoi sono stati anche dei cross decisivi per cui andiamo a conoscere questo Questo centro campista davvero bravo, ascoltiamo Di solito il settimo giorno si riposa, invece il bari oggi ha dato Sì, sì, è vero, ma è normale in questa epoca dell'anio fare la preparazione fa bene, fa bene questo, fa bene io ho tanti due, tre anni che non faceva preparazione e me viene benissimo Lei è praticamente l'altere godi Sili Gardi, però non disdenierebbene anche la sinistra? Sì, sicuro io l'anno scorso ci guardo anche la sinistra La seconda punta? Il piere preferito di Rivas. Il suo connazionale d'onda? che stiamo molto contenti di essere qui in Bali per la futura e spero di tenere un buon anni. voce che sono due gli attaccanti che dovranno andar via, uno invece il difensore che dovrebbe allontanarsi davanti. Alli ovviamente ci tratta di Giovanni. Non è sicuramente, si tratta di Giovanni. Ultimamente sta circolando la voce su cavalli, non è assolutamente cavalli anche perché Conte è stato parentorio cavalli resterà qui con me. La detto proprio ieri quindi non si tratta assolutamente di cavalli. Domani domani il bari riposerà domani mattina mentre riprenderà la preparazione domani pomeriggio quindi una piccola sosta. di ventrone che massacri i calciatori che abbia questi ritmi di lavoro e insomma intanto... Michele oggi un'ora e mezza di palestra i calciatori erano praticamente sfiniati però alla fine c'è stato un piccolo terzo tempo e come se ventrone si volesse scusare per il duro lavoro nei confronti dei suoi ragazzi quindi insomma il clima è comunque sereno Michele. Va bene domani mattina","Cisè and Claudia? Yes, good evening Michele. A very cold evening. It rained directly. The Bari faced, as you said, the first test and the local training, the one of the Val Ridanna, in really, really under the practicability conditions. However, the Bari played well, the Bari won 16-0 even in the North of Cronaca. The first improvements have already been seen by the people of Conte, What else will you tell us tonight? A bad news. Today we did badly in the way we did. We interviewed Maniero and asked the player how he was. We also heard the midfielder Rivas, who played very well today. We'll see him in the images we'll show you in a bit. Let's do a jump. What else can we add? Michael, you've opened up the dance and the horses. Simone, the horses. I have to highlight the great performance of Bianco, The only player to play all 90 minutes. And then a performance that really underlines the well-dressed who scored six goals. Let's see these goals. We can see the contribution that has been made. I went to the ball and I turned my head. How are you now? I'm fine now. What did the doctor say? We wait 24 hours and then we'll see if you're fine. Are you worried? A little. There's news about the condition of the body? There's no news because tomorrow we'll have the tests and the doctors. We talked to the media and they said the situation wasn't that bad. So good news. I'm curious. You did badly in a bad way, and they're team mates. I wouldn't want the room to be bad. I'm curious. We'd like to know more about the centre-back of Rivas who signed the game today and their cross-decisive games. This central pitch is really good. Usually you rest on the seventh day, but today you're in the bar. Yes, it's normal in this season. I'm doing well, I've been training for two or three years and I'm very good. You're the top of the Cilicardi, but you wouldn't be able to go to the left. Yes, I'm sure. Last year I played in the left too. I feel very good on both sides. I'm very happy to be here in Bali, I hope to have a good year. The two attackers will have to leave, and the defender will have to move away. Of course, there are young people. It's not about young people. The voice is about horses. It's not about horses, because Conte was a horse operator. He said it yesterday, so it's not about horses. Tomorrow the bar will rest, tomorrow morning, while the preparation will be tomorrow afternoon. So a little break. What do you think of Ventrone who massacres players who have these working times? Today, 1h30, the players were almost finished but there was a third time and Ventrone wanted to apologize for the hard work in front of his boys. So the atmosphere is still serene."

It's supposed to be in the workshop area where we're showing some of the components that made up the early BBR test skis as you can see they're made of wood and Look like they've made in somebody's garden shed and that's a bit like what it is in our test centre The ski itself is revolutionary straight away the minute you look at it You see a big wide tip that you know is going to float in powder But then if you study the shape a little more You can see then that it's going to make some really nice tight turns and in fact it's got a 11 meter radius turn so We think we've got one ski for the whole mountain here. It really is the one ski quiver If we look at the wall a minute the inspiration for the ski has come from surfboards, snowboards and eventually the BBR ski. So it is a very fresh different approach to just running with a regular ski and just tweaking it. This is, if you like, a bit of a milestone, we think, on new ski design. The first turn is pretty important. Everybody that uses ski has loved it from turn 1. It fills you with confidence to attack the run, go for it. If you see some powder get into it, if you like carving turns, you can do that. It really does work. models in the range a 7.9 which goes all the way down to about a 151 or you can go up with this model the 8.6 all the way up to a 186 but with a rocker tip and a sort of comfort tail pin tail which has got a flick up at the end the contact length on that 186 is probably more like a 174 so really manageable really easy to ski. Okay whereabouts would there be in the price how much are they? The 7.9 will be £400 and then you're going to have to add a binding. It's probably going to make it about £499. The 8.9 is £500 and you're probably going to go for a slightly higher performance binding so it'll be around about £600-$625 which is pretty comparable to other skis of this level and this standard. So it's not in any way an expensive ski, it's very accessible and we just know people can have a lot of fun. a lot of fun on the mountain. So we're not pigeonholing it, it's all on its own, it's a stand-alone ski so it's really versatile. Eric that's fantastic, thanks for having so much of your time on that. So now we're going to move on, hopefully have a chat with the guy who designed the ski.

I'll give you guys kind of the idea of tomorrow what it's like and that's that so today I was playing to upload that black ops gameplay like I said but it's somewhere in the other dimension So I'm just bringing you guys this PM9 gameplay just for today and then starting tomorrow It'll be back on schedule and you guys can actually see the schedule on the right side of my channel in the little description box by me like twitter and stuff i know you guys aren't youtube noobs you can do it yeah i got faith in you but uh so let's talk about mw3 a little bit i think it's getting boring like really really boring and i don't know i just feel like i need something else to play i need something else to bring to my channel and that's kind of why i'm starting these just for that simple fact that it's just getting really really boring and i don't know but I don't even know. I just need some good games to play. Sorry about that guys. I had a phone call the one and only time that people actually call me because I'm socially awkward and it's starting to commentary. I didn't know if you guys could notice that drop down or not. That's pretty much all I have for you guys. I'm trying to think is there anything else that I really want to talk about. I'm going to be doing my next tutorial. Okay, bye. Three kills, oh yeah. Rest in peace, man, Randy Savage."

What's wrong? Between us I can not see confidence. Look, here there are five hundred more. This goes for the house. I'm sorry, but I need to go to work. It can be. No, it doesn't matter if I don't sleep either. What's there? Well, see the printing where you work with such a little stuff. Find out what kind of paper you have, the amount of silence, how is the control. Well, in short, you know how it is. Well, and all this without anyone feeling it, right? Of course. I'm not a scientist. I'm a scientist. There are the girls, right? Up, up, it's going to be a delay. And that is punished by the law. I feel like the time is up. How did you feel like that? I was. If it was Puri, it was a time that doesn't come here. And that night you recommended? It was my recommendation. He wanted to give me a chance and I took the business out. And now he's talking about fear. No, he's not talking about fear. He's crazy. Who? Puri. So he was going to the police station, he put a leg on it, or what? You're crazy. You didn't dance. If he talks, we're lost. No, you're lost. I don't. I can accuse you that... We have to get out of this right now. Where are you going? To a water. To get out of all this, because that compromises, complies, that's a change. It's going to be pure in my hand. That's not necessary, mom. Now we are going to sit down a little to talk this quiet. What does the business of German look like? Well, he is the same as me. The same as you? Yes, yes, because he did nothing to me. But he knows everything. It is that I told him what they were hiding. Go to... to what could I buy German and earn some money? He knows the same as me."

La mayoría de los templos están en asentamiento, en lugares muy pobres. Y bueno, toda esa gente ha encontrado Mujica, yo diría, el caudillo de los pobres. El pai Julio Cromber, fundador de la agrupación Atabaque, ya integró una lista dentro del espacio 609. Y ahora, acompaña su militancia con la religión para que los orillas ayuden a Mujica a llegar a la presidencia. Nosotros somos referentes para mucha gente. La gente que concurre a los templos tiene interés en... Es como cuando un político habla por televisión, le está haciendo un referente de la gente. Nosotros somos referentes religiosos, pero también en la vida, en los cotidianos. Y es el caso que nos preguntan qué hacer con la política. Nosotros damos el consejo que nos parece mejor. como el presidente, que es lo ideal, creemos así, por eso lo difundimos, como para mejorar el país. La vida Pepe Mujica, nosotros nos encontramos como bandistas, como religiosos afroindígenas. Entonces es muy natural el apoyo que le brindamos. Tenemos una afinidad casi espiritual con la causa de Mujica. Yo creo que se terminó con Mujica, la época de los políticos de traje corbata ¿Mujicas se acerca alguno de los templos de ustedes? y la que más ha estado en templos. tienen su forma de encarar la vida, de su filosofía. Nos respetamos mutuamente, pero los queremos igual que a todos los urbachos. La MAI me planteó un desafío de cuando viniera el verano de hacer una actividad de esta escena. Al aire libre, en mi casa, me pareció lindo el desafío. Nuestro trabajo es mucho social también, digo, no solo nuestro templo, todos los templos trabajan con grupos de barrios o organizaciones que tienen que ver con ciertas problemáticas que pueden ser en muchos templos de comedores o hasta... Hay lugares donde tienen remedios porque hay gente que viene al templo con remedio, a veces comida. Cada templo es un mundo aparte y generalmente está asociado a la zona. De repente depende un poco del lugar del templo, pero ya te digo, La mayoría de los templos están en lugares muy pobres y el teléfono, por ejemplo, precisan un teléfono para poder llamar una ambulancia, para algo importante y van al templo a lo que por teléfono. ¿Hacen trabajo o prendas de alguna manera por el partido? En cierta forma pedimos, digo, yo no dejo de hacer lo que creo. Digo, para mí es una realidad, digo, mucha gente podrá no creerlo, hasta burlarse, pero a mí por tampoco. Yo creo y sé que se manejan fuerzas. Y bueno, y te aseguro que a los que están en contra, a los de los otros partidos, trato de que se les frene todo y bueno, y a los nuestros los los trato de ayudar de la manera que puedo. Hay muchos que se reirán, pero yo tengo mucha fe en eso. No fui el autor, pero me han cachado que me han responsabilizado en broma, vamos a decir. de los accidentes que han tenido los de los otros partidos. Y digo, eso no lo he hecho yo, ¿no? ¿Y qué protección le va a sufrir, o no sé, si a Pepe o al partido para que salga, para que salga presidente? Sabes que es un patriarca, ¿no? Creemos que más que protegerlo nos debe proteger. Pero está en una lucha muy difícil y creo que toda ayuda es imprescindible. Así que gastaremos velas, haremos oraciones, haremos ofrendas y militaremos mucho porque también creemos que debemos hacer esfuerzos humanos porque lo que se puede lograr espiritualmente es energía para poder luchar por la vida.","I am a Mayan, I am a bandit and I support José Mujica, president of the Republic very soon, if God wants and the Ollayans. Most of the temples are in settlements, in very poor places. And all those people have found Mujica, I would say, the cage of the poor. El Pai Julio Cromber, founder of the Tabac group, has already joined a list within the 609 space. And now, join his militant with religion so that the orillas help the music to reach the presidency. We are a reference for many people. The people who compete in the temples are interested in... It's like when a politician speaks on TV, he is referring to the people. We are religious, but also in daily life. And it's the case that they ask us what to do with politics. And we give them the advice that we think is better. We have a group of 609, the president, which is the ideal, we believe in this, that's why we spread it, and how to improve the country. I support him as a mother, I support him as a woman, I support him as a militant, social and political. I deeply believe in what he predicts as a politician and as a person. In that authenticity he predicts with his We are like bandits, like religious Afro-Indians. So it's very natural the support we give to them. We have an almost spiritual affinity with the cause of music. I think it ended with music, the era of the political wearing and wearing Corbata, which decided to take a step back. They were nice lies and difficult to understand. Supporting music doesn't cost me, because I don't have to pretend what I am. And Lucia is still standing, or at least that's how she demonstrated last Saturday when she inaugurated two of these premises, Mitad Templo, Mitad Comité. They have their own way of life, of their philosophy. We respect each other, but we love each other just like all the Uruguayans. May gave me a challenge when I came to the summer to do an activity of this kind. When I was free, I thought the challenge was beautiful. Our work is a lot of social work, not just our temple. All temples work with neighborhood groups. or organizations that have to do with certain problems that can be in many temples of eaters or even there are places where they have remedies because there are people who come to the temple with remedies sometimes food each temple is a separate world and it is generally associated with the area suddenly it depends a little on the place of the temple Most temples are in very poor places. And the telephone, for example, they need a telephone to be able to call an ambulance, for something important, and they go to the temple by phone. Do you do work or do you learn in any way by the game? In a way we ask, I say, I don't stop doing what I believe. I say, for me it is a reality, I say, many people will be able to I don't believe it, or even get bored, but I don't care either. I believe and I know that they handle strength. And well, I assure you that those who are against the other games, I try to stop them all. And well, and to our players, I try to help them in the way I can. There are many who will laugh, but I have a lot of faith in that. I wasn't the author, but they have caught me, they have responsibled me in a joke, let's say. of the accidents that the other parties have had. I haven't done that. And what protection will you give to Pepe or the party so that he can be president? You know, he's a patriarch. We believe that more than protecting him, he must protect us. But it's a very difficult fight and I think that all of it helps. So we will spend time, pray, and offer up, and we will fight a lot because we also believe that we must do human efforts because what can be achieved spiritually is energy to fight for life."

Troops First is an effort that was put forth by the city of Wichita Falls specifically their Chamber of Commerce and Industry to let people know that we need to honor those men and women in uniform as well as their families.

So what you're saying is you see someone in uniform and you say, hey, come on up. You go first. They're first in our hearts, the slogan says, and first in line. By the way, it's our pastor, our lead pastor, senior pastor, Dr. Bob McCartney, that really got us going behind them.

We now have a full-time minister of our staff and have built a new building specifically for our college ministry. And then the second area was Shepherd Air Force Base. And so we began to seek God. How could we have a presence closer to the base?

And even if there is, there's this little slide on the top that you can open all the way partially or keep it locked in for more heat. can also take the top off and what the cloud lotus it just sits on top of your bowl no foil no holes needed and I like it the design is it's pretty cool it could be polished a lot better it's a little dirty when I got it like not dirty as in there's dirt on it it's just the metal wasn't that polished and it's scratchy and kind of splotchy which for 60 65 I would have expected more. It's a cleaner taste. I don't regret it, although it was a bit pricey. But throughout my sessions today I haven't had any harshness whatsoever. The coals have usually gone about an hour and 30 minutes, an hour and 45 minutes. have been quite up to that two hour mark yet. I'm more of a hit it once then quit it type of guy. So once run round of coals is done, I'm usually done. So I'm not sure how the sessions would be with more rounds of coals. That's just for you to decide. Since I don't use multiple sets of coals usually. But anyways, that's just a quick look and quick review of the cloud Lotus.

In fact, if you'll read further down on this website, you can see people who've been using my techniques and been getting a lot of free advertising for their opportunities and offers and all sorts of different things they're trying to sell. However, the challenge is that some people come to this website and they think it's a free advertising academy. And I want to let you understand right now that the training that I'm doing on free advertising is not free. It's not free. The advertising that I show you how to get is free. Okay? And in fact, let me explain that briefly because I want to clarify this. You can actually get free advertising. I know that statement sounds crazy because people know about, well, I can pay for ads, I can pay for pay per click, I can do all this stuff, but I'm going to have to write out a check or pay money to somebody to get this advertising. What I teach people is not always. Let's say for example that this is your business. So you got a business, right? And you say, okay well I need to do pay per click advertising and magazine advertising, radio and TV, whatever you're going to do to promote that business. It can be an opportunity, a small business, whatever it is. So what you're doing is you're paying money to promote that business. Now this money, known as your budget, is a finite amount of money. You probably don't have the about it is that all of this advertising that I teach people to get, it is free, free, free. And what it's going to do is it's going to bring a lot of people in through TV, radio, magazines, search engines, websites, forums, all sorts of different ways to bring people prospects, we're interested in what you're selling to your website. And now what this allows you to do is break free of your budget. You know, if your budget is small or even non-existent Now you get to break free of that. Now you get to get all sorts of free advertising that's going to drive business to your website. It's going to help you make more money and some of this money you can now use to build this budget. See, it's a great system if you know how to do it. Now unfortunately most people don't know how to do it. I've been doing it for over 20 years now. Started in my teens. And I've been using these methods to grow my own business. In fact some of these methods that I'm going to be showing you, literally have helped me generate millions of dollars in sales. I'm not saying that you're going to do that, but it has generated millions of dollars in sales, some of the stuff that I reveal in the Free Advertising Academy. So what I've decided to do is share that information with others and you can read down on this website, you know, the results that people are getting. If you're interested in getting free advertising and figuring out how you can make more money without spending more money, then read the materials below and see if Free Advertising Academy is right for you.

That purpose was to be like an emergency backup gun that I kept in the electronic wall safe in my family room. Now I had said at the time that I was trying to decide between two guns, either a Glock of a couple of different types of Glocks or Smith & Wesson 686 357 Magnum Wheel Gun. Most people know I'm a wheel gun guy, so that's where I tend to lean. You know, I appreciate the beauty I appreciate the function of wheel gun. I started thinking, when you're buying a handgun, everyone acts as though you can either have quality or you can have reliability. They act like you can't have it all. You don't have to buy a gun just because it's reliable. There are tons of guns on the market that come with it all. They're good looking and they're reliable. They're functional yet they're aesthetically pleasing. You can have a little bit of a of very functional, very powerful weapons. So you don't have to make that distinction if you don't want to. There's no reason to settle for less than what you want. So in the end, I decided you kind of have to be an idiot to choose the Glock. So I chose the Glock. Okay, as I said in the end, I went with the Glock. And I went with the Glock 23. I was trying to decide between the Glock 19, 23, 33 or 27 or 26. And I decided with the 23, mainly because of the capacity and extra snappy round of the 40 caliber which is one of my favorite calibers. Now I used to have a Glock 23. We still have one in the family but it's not mine. I used to have one a while back I went through and got rid of all my non stainless polymer guns. I didn't have a stainless slide, I got rid of it. But you know I decided I wanted this back. Like I was saying earlier how you don't have to compromise between beauty and functionality and reliability. Well I don't consider this a compromise because I'm not not compromising. This gun is serving a specific purpose. Sometimes you just want a gun that works and you don't want to pay for anything more. And that's what this is. This is a gun that works. This is a gun that's going to sit in a safe and place I ever needed in an emergency and it needs to be able to function then. That's a Glock. A revolver would have done that too. It would have done it very well just as well as a Glock would have. The difference is this was 489. The Smith and Wesson 686 is 709. So you can see there a little bit of price difference. So sometimes you decide when I'm in a situation where all I need is reliability and function that's all I'm going to pay for. I don't want to pay for any more. Now one's going to see this. It's going to be locked in a wall safe all the time. All that I care about it when I need it is that it works and that it has a large number of high caliber rounds in it for me to use to defend myself and my family. So in the end I don't consider this a compromise because like I say I wasn't looking for beautiful, I wasn't looking for impressive looking, I wasn't looking for any of those features, any aesthetic features at all. I was only looking for function and I only wanted to pay for function. And when you only want function and you only want to pay for function, a Glock's your best choice. Now I will have to say that in some ways Glock's are attractive. They are attractive in a very utilitarian and minimalistic way. So if you're someone that finds them attractive, if you actually like their looks and you want something that's functional also, well then And how could you go wrong with a Glock? But like I said before, when you're looking for just function and you don't want to pay for anymore, even if you find them ugly, the Glock is a great choice.","Subscribe to my channel to know that a few days ago I said that I was going to need to buy a new gun to serve a specific purpose in the house That purpose was to be like an emergency backup gun that I kept in the electronic wall safe in my family room Now I had said at the time that I was trying to decide between two guns either a Glock of a couple of different types of glocks or Smith and Wesson 686 Magnum 357 Magnum wheel gun Most people know I'm a wheel gun guy.

Dezember 2012 PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY! _______________________________________________________  Story: Bei der „Sagrada Familia"" handelt es sich um ein faszinierendes, römisch-katholisches Bauprojekt in Barcelona. Das Besondere an dem Bau ist, dass es bereits 1882 begonnen wurde und bis heute unvollendet ist. Das Bauwerk ensteht und wächst langsam weiter, doch die jüngsten Prognosen sprechen davon, dass erst 2026 mit einer Fertigstellung zu rechnen sei. Um den Vater des Bauwerks, Antoni Gaudi, ranken sich viele ungeklärte Fragen. Wer aber waren seine Nachfolger und was trieb sie an, gemeinsam und über einen Zeitraum von 125 Jahren an dem Projekt zu wirken? Die Dokumentarfilmer zeichnen den Entstehungsprozess der Sagrada von seinen Anfängen an nach. Auf der Entdeckungsreise kommen Mitarbeiter aus den verschiedensten Bereichen zu Wort und geben Einblicke in ihre Arbeit, über die Motivation und ihren Wissens- und Erfahrungsschatz rund um das Gebäude.  _______________________________________________________  Abonnieren | Liken | Folgen: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KinoxHd Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Trail3rHD Twitter: https://twitter.com/KinoXHD _______________________________________________________  Tags: Sagrada ""Sagrada official trailer"" ""Sagrada german trailer"" ""Sagrada deutsch trailer"" ""Sagrada trailer"" ""Sagrada deutsch german trailer"" ""Sagrada International trailer"" ""Sagrada official teaser"" ""Sagrada Teaser"" ""Sagrada HD"" ""Full HD"" ""High Definition Quality"" ""2012"" ""Deutsch"" ""German"" ""US Trailer"" ""English Trailer"" ""Deutsch Trailer"" ""German Trailer"" ""German Trailer 2013"" "" ""Deutsch Trailer 2013"" ""Official Trailer 2013"" ""Official Trailer"" ""Official Trailer 2013"" ""Trailers"" ""Trailers 2013"" ""Trailer 2013"" ""Movie"" ""Film"" ""Movie Trailer"" ""Film Trailer"" ""Cinematic Trailer"" ""Theatrical Trailer"" ""Teaser Trailer"" ""Debut Trailer"" ""International Trailer"" ""Exclusive Trailer"" ""720p"" ""1080p"" ""3D"" ""Interview"" ""Movie Clip"" ""Preview"" ""Trail3rHD""","Teaser Trailer, Sagrada, German Trailer, Sagrada german trailer, Official Trailer, Official Teaser Trailer, Sagrada International trailer, German, German Trailer 2013, Deutsch Trailer 2013, Deutsch, Sagrada official trailer, Sagrada deutsch german trailer, Sagrada Teaser, Deutsch Trailer, International Trailer, Sagrada official teaser, Official Trailer 2013, Sagrada trailer, Sagrada HD, Sagrada deutsch trailer, Trailer 2013",120,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/ZjxM-WoM1ZI.mp3,"Die Sagrada Familia, eine kathedrale Mitte in unserer Zeit.

Because I see it every single day. Every day I see that vision board. And so all the things that I would like to to accomplish financially, what I'd like to accomplish spiritually, what I'd like to accomplish in my family, what I would like to accomplish educationally, etc, etc. In my career, all those things, I have a picture of something that represents that thing and then I'll have a statement right up underneath it. Does that make sense? So I make those declarations to myself on a daily basis. And so when I look at the vision board, I'll say, for example, I will live in this house. I will own a million dollar home. I will be the premier fashion designer. I will be global. You know, all those types of things, my company will be global. So there are affirmations that I tell myself on a daily basis because here's the thing, all except for one, One of those things on my vision board from last year happened, which said to me, okay, my vision wasn't big enough. So then this year, like, you know everything was just out of control. Huge, right? Because I felt like an undershot myself on the vision board last year. So this year I said, okay, well, not only do I want to be working for a tile of Harry, I want to be a tile of Harry. Right? So like every year it, you know, it got bigger and bigger. And so my point is what you want to do is you want to find pictures that depict what you want because your mind sees in pictures. You have to have a picture of it, not just write some words on a piece of paper. You literally have to have a picture of it because when your mind can see that thing, guess what it's gonna do? All those decisions you make on a daily basis, they're gonna add up and you're gonna look up and you're gonna be like, wow, I accomplished it. I actually did it. I'm not just talking about it anymore. It's a done deal. Check. And then you move on to something else. So that's the homework assignment. I want you to start working on a vision board and try to get it done within the week. Imagine all the things you will put up there. Imagine all the things that you have envisioned for yourself. Where you want to be. Where you going. You say you want to be a straight A student. Put that up there. Only good things can come from that, right? I never met anyone who says, oh, so many bad things happen to me because I got straight As. You know? So many bad things happen to me because I was obedient. So many bad things happen to me because I carried myself off a young lady. Makes sense? So can we do that? We don't have any problems with getting that done? And start seeing how things start coming to pass. It's gonna blow your mind. It works. It works. So I hope this was helpful. And I hope that just saying it out of your mouth what you're gonna be, what you're good at, was helpful. Because now you should be able to articulate confidently and boldly and don't ever apologize to anybody for your gifts. That's what they are, their gifts. Walk in them, own them, make your parents proud. Leave the next generation more than what you have. Your children should have more than what you have. That make sense? Your children should have much more than what you have. That's the expectation. You should be giving them so much more than what you have. Because you're supposed to increase and you're supposed to take your gift and you're supposed to be fruitful with it. Remember, you teach people how to treat you. You carry yourself like a young lady, you dress appropriately, you're not flaunting everything. Well guess what? You're gonna attract a certain type of person. You put them all out there, you're gonna also attract a certain type of person. Makes sense? So carry yourself like a young lady. You say you wanna be a surgeon, you say you wanna be a nurse, you say you wanna be a fashion designer. Okay, well can people see that when they see you? You say you wanna be a star athlete, can someone really see that when they see you? Ask yourself that. Make sense? You design your own life. You do. Nobody else but you. You are accountable for what you do. You are accountable. So make every day count. Make every decision count. You should be impacting people around you. You are the leader. Make sense? You are the leader. Don't look for somebody else to lead you. You are the leader. You are the leader. You don't need anybody else to lead you. You be that leader. that they're looking for. You represent. That's why so many kids are lost. They're looking for somebody to follow. Why so many kids get involved in gangs. You're looking for a family, you're looking for somebody. They just want to belong, right? You be the leader. You should start attracting people that are like you. If all your friends are doing bad things, then you need to check yourself. Because that says a lot about you. Not about them, about you. Because if you were a leader, it's like, who, get real. Who's the leader? Who? Who's leading whom? The leader will always stand out. I can go through this room and tell you exactly who the leaders are in here. Make sense? But that's a choice. Do you want to lead or you want to follow? Raise your hand if you want to lead. You want to follow? Okay. So if your leader, guess what comes with leadership? Responsibility. That makes sense? You're responsible for inspiring others. You're responsible for inspiring others. to do greater and guess what you're equipped to do it because you're locked and loaded with your own gifts and as long as you stay on that path and you do What you're called to do you're gonna be a force to be reckoned with So I enjoy talking to you ladies. It was so very nice to meet you all and to hear your stories and to hear You know what you're gonna be. I can't wait to see you in magazine articles I can't wait to see you on the news doing great exploits in this world because we already know it's just a matter of time Thank you.","Okay, so did everyone have a chance to go? Yes. Okay. So I really like what you guys had to say. I think you really, really put some thought into where you're going and what it's going to take to get there. And I think you have a clear focus now. So this is like a homework activity that I'd like you guys to work on. Okay. Raise your hand if you've ever heard of a vision board. Okay. One of you please volunteer to tell us what that is. Okay, right here when you put everything that you envision in your life on a border on something like say you want it on a wall you put like Everything that you want to happen like if you say you want to be an actress You'll most likely have plays on there and plays you want to be in and you'll have like I guess costumes because You have you'll have like on mine. I have a ring. I like ring cars, you just put everything that you want to see yourself having in the future. Stuff like that. Okay, and raise your hand if you have a vision board. Okay, so this is a very worthwhile activity. I myself, I have a vision board on my wallet home. I do vision boards to start every year.

Vi ska inte ge lite folk ut på stan och fråga om vi kan ge lite vet om vi ska och vilka hemma i dörren dyta. Varje dag använder en människa i slikt 6 000 liter vatten per dag. Detta innebär inte att vi som individer förbrukar så mycket vatten bara att duscha eller dricka vatten utan det krävs även en stor mängd liter att framställa annat som till exempel gynns, kött, ris och kaffe. 180 liter går åt till sådant som vi är till vardags. Sådant som viss fett, mat och dryck. Men detta är bara för att få en faktur bland 100 fass andra. Trots att vi har så mycket vatten här i Sverige att använda så finns det människor över hela världen som gör varje unit av törst och svärdhet som är indien där det är där en person per minut. För att få en hållbar utveckling måste vi minska vattenförbrukningen. Och min häng skulle skillas med hela världens hap. Vatten? Så skulle jag ändå ha en matkedd för att jag skulle vara... Ja nu sker inte vi ha marovisan på svimbygden här. Men när det var under vatten, vi skulle tänka på hur mycket vatten vi använder. Använder det bara så mycket jag behöver? Som till exempel när vi diskar dystjö av städer. Nej jag använder så mycket jag behöver. Ja men hur mycket... Hur skulle du känna sig ändå utan att använda vatten? Tårt som fan. Vi skandar nämligen en av de mest förra under den här områden i Sverige. Det var alltså ganska länge sedan Men idag är mycket smartare. Därför måste vi göra något. Man har hittat höjga halter, eller till och med mycket höjga halter av sink, krom, koppar, fixilver och POH. De här ämnena är väldigt farliga. Både för oss. Och familjen. Det där man säger döda sunnen som köer fisk och koralne. Men alltså det andra miljön i världen, dödra vatten och tröde rosa. Det är en svensk rent dyrk vatten. Det är som ett vatten om olika affärer. Man har hittat höga halter. Eller till och med höga halter.","We are not going to give people some respect and ask them if they know what they are doing and what they are doing. Every day, a person uses 6000 liters of water per day. This does not mean that we as individuals only use a shower or drink water. We also need a large amount of water to prepare other things like wine, meat, rice and coffee. Water? I would like to have a food bowl and a shower. You don't need to use the water, we can think of how much you need. As for when you're going to a disc, you need to use the water. No, I only use it as much as I need. How much would you like to use? Dirt as hell. We're going to be one of the most vulnerable areas in Sweden. They have been doing this for 200 years since the 80's, for example in the taxidermy, for example in the taxidermy and so on. They have released a lot of gifts out of the taxidermy, barely without a bushel. They didn't know what they would do with all of these gifts, and they didn't believe it was something. But today we are much smarter, that's why we have to do something about this. You have to find higher levels, or even higher levels of zinc, chromium, copper, silver and POH. These levels are very dangerous, both for us and for the rest of the world. and family. If you can find a real high-quality drink today, share it and it's the best. It's a low-carb product from DDT and DDT has negative effects on the natural. Many birds have died of this. One thing, the people's eggs were so thin that the eggs were crossed under the surface.

Even if you are developing, you must know what the problem is in the world. Is there a new hope for death in the water? But how can I improve the way the water is being used? How can I help the water in Africa? But can you help the water in the community and in the water facilities? I have been to the water, so I am not afraid of the water. You have to find a higher place or a higher place."

Check it. I is here with my main man, Governor Dick Formberg, who was former Attorney General, and in his ear to explain to us about the law. What is legal? Well, I think most conduct that all of us engage in on a day-to-day basis is legal. So what is illegal? What is illegal is what the elected representatives of the people define as crimes. What is barely legal? Well that's when you get into technicalities and that's why you have trials. Because we saw this film called Barely Legal Free and it was about these two naughty college girls and them had done their own work and then as punishment they had to have a free edder with their supervisor, this teacher. Is that to do with do with the law? It's hard to say. That would probably be governed by the rules of the institution, the college. Well, in this institution it was very strict ruled that if you didn't do your own work, you will get boned. Right. Well, that's a law of sorts. Well, it's a well-good law. As you've seen that film. Yes, no, I haven't. You should check it out. I will now, because you've recommended it. It's well good. It's like... Barely legal. Barely legal free. Free. Okay. Good. When is it legal to murder someone? Never. Because murder is a defined term. Murder means a willful, premeditated killing. What if they call your mama whole? Is it alright to murder them then? You can't use as a defense any kind of verbal provocation. No. What if they say Surely then you can just sort them out and say yo, you is gone. What you said up today was legal. Now he's illegal. What happens when the jury can't decide whether the geezer should go down or not? Hung jury sometimes called to. Well, I don't see the connection. What do you... What exactly is the law of cutting the cheese? No, it's whoever smelt it, dealt it. I don't know if there's any law that covers that. But is the definition whoever smelt it, dealt it? Or is it whoever said the rhyme committed the crime? I understand what you're saying. Criminal liability can attach to a person who does an act. The one who cuts the cheese. A person who aids or assists the person. The one who smelt it. Or the one who agrees on a plan to do the criminal act. The one who's dealt with it. and they will never be able to kill you. There's a finite limit to what you can eat to prevent people from killing you. I don't think that's a real risk. Yo, so listen up to the words of my man here, Governor Dick Formberg, because you better learn the law, otherwise you is going down. You're going to be fried like chicken, unless you know how to keep legal. Big up yourself, keep it real safe. How come it is illegal to nick someone's TV, but not illegal to steal their girlfriends? The television set is the property of someone else, but somebody's girlfriend is not their property. But surely a girlfriend is worth much more than a telly, unless it's like one of them plasma screen things that surrounds out. I agree with you. I think that's probably true. But why don't the government Introduce a series of penalties. Say, alright, we're finding you $200 if you kiss her, Jujie Fruits. We're going to give you three months inside the can if you nibble at M&Ms. And we're going to give you life if you take her up the Hershey Highway. I was Attorney General, my name is Meese.

This is my haul video for things from a vino to toothpaste to wipes and things like that. So the first thing I'm going to show off is this dial clean and refresh antibacterial body wash with moisturizers for long lasting freshness. And this is the spring water scent. And I thought this was really cute because it's just a huge bottle and it's like a pump and it's body wash. So I thought it was cool. Alright, even the next thing is cool mint listerine. It's all bubbly because I don't know why I'm just like addicted to like swishing around mouthwash and then it gets all bubbly. I just I just love that. This is really good. I love this because it wakes me up. I can be a butt head in the morning. Alright, next thing. What do we have? We have these Scott moisturizing wipes. We have these Scott Moisturizing Baby Wipes. The thing about baby wipes is they're more comfortable than toilet paper. I discovered this through my friend. You can try it out. It's actually pretty good. I like it. Then we have these Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads. It helps prevent breakouts and gently exfoliates are clear, even looking skin. What you'll do with the pads is you just take one and they have two sides. the soft side with lots of soap on it and then they have these scrubber sides and you'll rub it on your skin and then it's like a face wash but on a pad and I think it's better than the way like you just put it on and then you rinse it off like a face wash and then pat your face dry, your face feels awesome. Alrighty. Next thing is the Philips Sonic Hair Tube Brush and this is just the travel case. The toothbrush is really good. I use it all the time. It's got this barrel and it is where the battery is. Then there's the little green light for how much battery I have left. I have a good bit of battery left. Then the little air buttons turns up the power or down the power. Then each set comes with one of the barrels and then three of the different tops. Each have these little different colored bands on them. I'm using the purplish pink one and I think it comes with blue and green also and then it comes with a charger that plugs into the wall and it's really small. I'm like seriously it's like this big but I don't have it with me and then it comes with this cute little traveler case and what you'll do is you'll just stick the top in there like that and stick the barrel in like that and then you can just shut it and close it and then it fits perfectly for traveling. Alrighty, then we only have like two more things. I think, I don't know. Alrighty, so this is the Awful Fresh Isoactive Whitening Toothpaste, and this is like some rock and stuff. You put it on your toothbrush, brush your teeth, and it starts, oh whoops, starts kind of foaming, you can kind of see foam on there, but it starts foaming and it's really cool. And it feels really good in your mouth, but if you don't like the flavor, It's okay, not everyone does. Hard roll issue. Alrighty. And then something similar to that, if you have sensitive teeth is the um, cinncidine, um, daily toothpaste for sensitive teeth, whitening, foaming. Then the aquafresh actually has a new um, I don't know, like ingredients in it, so that it removes three times more bacteria. So this is the new one. And then we have, oh, I love these to death man. These are so cute, so awesome. So quick and simple. Let me see if I can figure out how to open it. Just peel back the little wrapper. And I know you all have heard of these, the Colgate Wisp that you can put in your purse. And then they're like little mini toothbrushes. And then they have the little toothpaste to have in the middle. And then you just brush your teeth. And then it's also got the little pick, in case you've got food in your mouth or something. And then you'll be prepared for a kiss or something. So really cute. It's really tiny and fits in your purse, which I love. I love tiny. They're cute, right? All of us girls, thanks, uh? Okay. What else do we have? We have also the Crest Pro Help, and this is another good, wait, another good mouthwash. Look how much foam that is. I love this stuff, man. Okay, but it fights plaque, fights ginger bites, and fights bad breath, just like the Listerine, and this one's really good too. So, we have, if you have like, This is for more of younger kids the swab kids to one shampoo. It's free and gentle. It's the new Doesn't say what? What flavor what I wrote Senate is but it's lightly framed lately Frank fragrance and so it's and it's also tear-free, so this is good for um Kids younger kids and it also has a little back on back like a do you know thing which I think cute and then I have this Pantene Pro-V Always Smooth Toujours-Lizé Champou and I love Pantene. It's amazing with your hair. Like no kidding. And then I have this Con Air Brush because I love the squishy handle and everybody always messes with it, but I kind of like it smooth so I can just grip it and it works very well. Like my hair right now is like so messy so it's really weird. and then I just always brush through my hair non-stop because I'm addicted to brushing my hair sometimes. And then I can just brush through my hair and it doesn't hurt very bad because it's very strong. It's a very strong brush and it works very well. My hair already feels better. And so I guess that's it. I hope y'all like it and come watch other vids later on, so...","Alright, hey y'all.

We have also the Crest Pro Help, and this is another good, wait, another good mouthwash. Look how much foam that is. I love this stuff, man. Okay, but it fights plaque, fights ginger bites, and fights bad breath, just like the Listerine, and this one's really good too. So, we have, if you have like, This is for more of younger kids the swab kids to one shampoo. It's free and gentle. It's the new Doesn't say what? What flavor what I wrote Senate is but it's lightly framed lately Frank fragrance and so it's and it's also tear-free. So this is good for um Kids younger kids and it also has a little back on back like a do you know thing which I think cute and then I have this Pantene Pro-V Always Smooth Toujours Le Zay Champou and I love Pantene. It's amazing with your hair. Like, no kidding. And then I have this Con Air brush because I love the squishy handle and everybody always messes with it but I kind of like it smooth so I can just grip it and it works very well. Like, my hair right now is like so messy so it's really weird. and then I just always brush through my hair non-stop because I'm addicted to brushing my hair sometimes. And then I can just brush through my hair and it doesn't hurt very bad because it's very strong. It's a very strong brush and it works very well. My hair already feels better. And so I guess that's it. I hope y'all like it and come watch other vids later on, so..."

But we see too many of them incorrectly tiling showers.  This will always lead to water damage and more importantly, a very expensive fix.  We put together this video to show people what a properly waterproofed shower should look like.","tile, handyman, shower, IN, evansville, waterproofing, newburgh",264543,290,74,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/b1HTytjQ3HQ.mp3,"We're going to show you what not to do when tiling your shower. We just took the shower doors off to get ready to demo out this bathroom because it wasn't installed properly. You can see right here how the tiles just fall off. The main reason is because the tile is installed directly over the drywall with no water proofing behind it. Over time the tile is going to crack, the grout is going to turn and crack, and then there's going to be water behind there. going to run it out. And so that's why we have to redo this tile shower that was just installed over less than a year and a half ago. So we'll go ahead and keep demoing and see what we're running to. So we've done a little more demo to see what we're dealing with. I just wanted to show you this is what's not supposed to happen with your tile. You shouldn't be able to pull it right off the wall like that. So we finally got everything tore out and if you come over here you can see all the damage that was created. Just because a shower wasn't properly waterproof when it was installed, all that water leaked underneath the floor pan and completely rotted out the whole subfloor. It even got over against the wall. You can see all the mold damage, water damage. Those bores there are dripping wet with water. And so what we'll have to do now is let it bring in a de-mitifier, dry it all out, fix the subfloor, and then go back with with a waterproofing system that we'll show you a little bit later. So we repaired all the damaged areas with the subfloor and everything that was down there. We dried it out with a dehumidifier for two days, got all the moisture out of it. And we went back with a waterproofed subfloor. It's not treated, but it's got a coating on top. It just has a layer of waterproofing. And then we went ahead and put all the cement board or permanent base on the walls where all the tile is going to go. and add no layer of waterproofing. And then finally we're going to use a system made by Schluter. It's called a KERDI system. And what that is, it's a kit that includes a star foam base, depending on the size. And once you cut it, it will lay together. And it goes together like a puzzle. It's also tapered for the drain, for water drainage. And then it includes a curb fit in here to keep the water inside the shower. So this hose system along with a waterproof membrane that goes on the walls which we'll show later completely envelops the hose shower and keeps it waterproof. So we finally got the Keurty system completely installed and as you can see the shower is now completely waterproofed with this membrane. And so there should not be any leaks whatsoever from water that may get behind the tile or grow out. Anything that does get in will filter down and get into the drain. The way the drain is designed, any water that gets underneath it can still filter into the drain. So this whole shower is now completely waterproof and shouldn't have any problems. And this is how every shower system should be done to prevent any water damage like we saw before. So we got all the tile put on the shower. The only thing we have left to do now is to crop all the corners. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes that I see do-yourselfers make. That is, they want to grout everything. The problem with that is, anytime you have perpendicular walls or perpendicular materials, they'll move separate of each other. If you put grout in these corners, eventually they will crack. and it's almost like concrete. And so what we do, and what I recommend is using a sanded caulk that is color matched to the grout. Any place that sells the grout also sells the caulking. So anywhere that is a perpendicular wall, we will caulk all that. Even around the curb here, all of this will be caulked. All down around the pan. Everywhere there's two corners that meet. And then also we will caulk along the edge the drywall and the tile here because that's two different materials that are meeting each other. So that's probably the most common problem mistake that do your shoppers make is grouting the corners when they need to be using caulk. And so tomorrow we'll come back after this is all dry, caulk everything and finish everything up.","We're going to show you what not to do when tiling your shower.

What's your assessment of this? Did the raid violate Pakistani sovereignty? Yes, I think that the exhilaration in the United States is matched very definitely with the humiliation along with a mixture of anger and apprehension about what's coming next. In my view, and I think increasingly in the view of many, the United States not only did not bring Pakistan in on this raid, but possibly didn't inform them until they had cleared Pakistani airspace following the raid. Now that along with the fact that U.S.-Pakistan relations were, in my judgment, had already reached about the lowest point since 9-11, partly stemming from the January arrest of Raymond Davis, a CIA asset contract employee in Lahore and so forth. That had already severely damaged U.S.-Pakistan relations. And that, coming with a very embarrassing fact that the Obama administration had dramatically increased the use of drone attacks on Pakistani terrain. So this comes, this moment of terrific humiliation for Pakistan and domestic political problems comes at a moment when the US-Pakistan relationship had already reached a very low point. But the Americans will say, hang on a second, you talk about the mistrust there, they will say, well if we did say to the Pakistanis, this is what we're doing, that it could have jeopardized the mission anyway. Absolutely. There is so much distrust. That of course is the point. There's terrific distrust between the United states and Pakistan that has existed now for years. And there would have been a fear that at this moment of capturing the prize Bin Laden that any leak in advance might have resulted in a very different kind of raid with casualties or perhaps with Bin Laden's escape and so forth. So not surprising that they didn't share the information. Let's talk about some of the political fallout for the Pakistanis. I mean, is the government in Islamabad in real danger of collapsing? here because opposition groups are calling for the government to resign, as you say, the government's deeply embarrassed. How much trouble is the Pakistani government really in? I don't think it's in that much trouble. The public loss of confidence in their government is very, very deep in Pakistan, and it has been that way for many, many years. Pakistanis, I think, are enured to the fact that the government is deep in corruption and very much at the mercy of American wishes in regard to strategic decisions in the region. So this is, this may be the icing on the cake there, but it certainly doesn't change things. After all, the army in Pakistan is very much in command of things. It's a big army, it's an efficient and disciplined army, and there's very little likely that public demonstrations and protests are going to erupt there, having any similarity with what's going on throughout the Arab world in the middle release. It's very, very unlikely. All right, Robert Wessing, thank you very much indeed for your time.","Well Robert Wersing is a professor of international politics at Georgetown University here in Doha and he's with me in the studio Robert let's just talk first about the different reactions there's been laden killing because it's quite interesting what Kamal Haider was saying there in Pakistan obviously in the US It's one of one of euphoria But yet in Pakistan one of humiliation even embarrassment for the government.

It says that Len runs a mile in eight minutes at this rate. How long will it take him to run a 26 mile marathon? Okay, so we could figure out the answer to that question I think pretty easily. We would take 8 times 26, but let's see what we actually have to do. It doesn't look like they're asking us to solve how long it takes him. So which of the following problems can be solved using the same arithmetic operations? Aha! So we just set up to multiply. Let's underline that part. We are right here. This would be 26 times 8. I'm not going to say what that equals. I don't really care what that equals for this problem. 26 times 8. What are we doing? Here we are multiplying. So multiply. That's what we're concerned with, or that's what we want to know. What would be done in the same way? So that are used to solve the problem above. So we're looking for another one where we would have to multiply to get the This one, let's do just one at a time here. So choice A, Lynn runs 26 miles in 220 minutes. How long does it take them to run each mile? That would be a matter of taking 220 and dividing it by 26. So this is a divide by problem. Is that the right choice? No, because you're supposed to be multiplying. Which one is the same here? So this one, you're dividing. That is not the right choice. Number 175, part B here says A librarian has 356 books to place on each of these. each shelf will contain the same number of books, how many books can the librarian place on each shelf. So this one, same idea. You have all these books, this total number of books, you've got 18 shelves to put them on, so 18 shelves to split them or divide them up into, so you'd have 356 divided by 18. This is another divide by problem. Notice I'm not actually solving this, I don't really need to do that, I don't care to do that if I don't have to, but I'm just saying What is the operation? What are we doing? We're dividing. Okay, choice C, a cracker box weighs 200 grams. What is the weight of 100 boxes? This, there we go. That's what I need. I need to take, this one would be 200 times 100 boxes would give me my total number of grams for the weight of 100 boxes. So this one, this looks like it's the right thing. This one I'm also multiplying. So this looks like it's my right answer choice C. I just want to check choice D and make sure I didn't make a silly mistake up here. So let's just double check that and verify. Each basket of strawberries weighs 60 grams. How many baskets can be filled from 500 grams of strawberries? So you'd have this large pile of 500 grams of strawberries. Actually, that's not that heavy, but you'd have this 500 gram pile of strawberries. We're splitting up into baskets that weigh 60 grams each. That's another divide question. divide again. So the correct choice was what we thought it was, choice C is the correct choice because we are multiplying in both. Notice again we are not actually figuring it out. You could. This would be 20,000. That would be 20 times 8 is 160 and 6 times 8 is 48. So 208, take them 208 minutes but we don't have to do that. This one we just have to figure out what it is, what's the same operation. So when it's 175, choice C is the correct choice.","This is release question 175 for casting math. It says that Len runs a mile in eight minutes at this rate. How long will it take him to run a 26 mile marathon? Okay, so we could figure out the answer to that question. I think pretty easily we would take 8 times 26 But let's see what we actually have to do. It doesn't look like they're asking us to solve How long it takes him so which of the following problems can be solved using the same arithmetic operations? to multiply. Let's underline that part. We are right here. This would be 26 times 8. I'm not going to say what that equals. I don't really care what that equals for this problem. 26 times 8. What are we doing? Here we are multiplying. So multiply. That's what we're concerned with, or that's what we want to know. What would be done in the same way? So that are used to solve the problem above. So we're looking for another one where we would have to multiply to get the right This one, let's do just one at a time here. So choice A, Lynn runs 26 miles in 220 minutes. How long does it take them to run each mile? That would be a matter of taking 220 and dividing it by 26. So this is a divide by problem. Is that the right choice? No, because you're supposed to be multiplying. Which one is the same here? So this one, you're dividing. That is not the right choice. Number 175, part B here says A librarian has 356 books to place on each of these. each shelf will contain the same number of books, how many books can the librarian place on each shelf. So this one, same idea. You have all these books, this total number of books. You've got 18 shelves to put them on, so 18 shelves to split them or divide them up into. So you'd have 356 divided by 18. This is another divide by problem. Notice I'm not actually solving this. I don't really need to do that. I don't care to do that if I don't have to.

I still receive those calls, but now what the schools are doing because of the concussion law since summer of 2010 in the state of Massachusetts is that when the child has a concussion they cannot return back until being cleared by a physician. The school nurse is also privy to it as is the trainer. But everybody come Monday morning is being more privy to the fact that the child has sustained a concussion. So now oftentimes I'll receive a call from the nurse saying are there any accommodations that the child needs because we are familiar with the fact that he has had a concussion. One thing that I just want to caution is with a concussion law, children are supposed to be seeing their pediatrician and the families are taking the children to the pediatrician but where I'm finding a little bit of a breakdown is that although as comprehensive as the pediatrician is, and wants to be for the child, there are some pediatricians that are out there that are clearing the child to return. And I've had children return as early as three days because they're not displaying symptoms of concussion. Gone are the days where the symptom concussion has to be vomiting or has to be dizziness. They can be subtle, but if the pediatrician isn't aware of it, the child is clear to return and they go back to the playing field a week later. And this is incredibly dangerous. So what I'd like to see happen is that we have more resources for those that are able to clear the child with the knowledge of brain injury. Could it also be sometimes that the child is not being as forthright as he or she could be? Absolutely. And those children, if they want to play on that following game and they're the starter, they're not going to share a lot of information. But there are subtle neurocognitive assessments that can be done for the children to see if they're having any distraction, attention issues, other issues of cognition that might be problematic that a physician may not be able to pick up. as subtle as they are because of their lack of education with concussions per se. The entity in charge of implementing and enforcing the new law is the Department of Public Health. Although it is quite a large undertaking, the department is efficiently making it as easy as possible for everyone involved. Dr. Lauren Smith is the medical director of the DPH and the person ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with the law. Well, the department has a responsibility for turning the law into regulations and then supporting schools as they implement them. And when did you first start taking notice of head injuries and concussions in school sports? The department has been interested in this for a while. Our data has shown us that unfortunately head injuries in sports isn't rare. So several years ago the department got a group together to really focus on concussions and sports and over the past years actually has distributed thousands of heads-up concussions that we get through the CDC, worked with key stakeholders like the Brain Injury Association. So we've really been thinking about this for a while, even before the law was passed. And what have you been doing to implement the law? Have you been visiting schools? Implementing it is a lot of different steps. The first thing we needed to do was to identify training that was mandated as part of the law. And this is training for parents and students as well as school, athletic staff and others. And the rationale for that really is to make sure that everyone is on the same page, understands what the consequences of concussion can be, especially if you don't acknowledge it and recognize it early. But also really just to understand what are the signs and symptoms? Concussion can be subtle and so a lot of people weren't aware that some of the things really could be signs of concussion. What's involved in the training and who takes place? Is it a class? Is it a long course? We decided we really wanted to make sure it was easy and accessible to people and we ideally wanted it to be free. So there are two trainings that we identified that had all of the key components of what we wanted people to know. One of those is through the CDC. The Centers for Disease Control has a website devoted to concussion issues. And so there's training for parents, students, coaches, and others as well as a host of other materials which are great. The other is also excellent and that's the National Federation of High School Sports. They have an online training. Again, it's free and hits all the high points of what we would want people to know. So these coaches and trainers and parents, do they go in and they take almost like an online course and then who certifies that they're taking it? There's two ways of doing that. One would be, for example, you can get a certificate that prints out, you know, after you've completed the course. The other thing that we wanted to make sure that people had the opportunity to do because not everyone has access to computers is there's materials for parents and students and coaches on the website, the CDC website, and so people could print that off, hand it out, distribute it. We've had coaches and athletic directors hand them out at the preseason meeting for the football team players and the parents, and then they just know who came to the meeting and take that attendance and know that everyone got the material. cost to implement or are there other expenses involved? The training piece should be low cost. I think really most of it is we've tried very hard to incorporate the regulations that we've put in place into what we hope people are already doing because we know that the schools don't have a lot of extra funds or any extra funds to implement this. So we tried to be sensitive to that. How many student athletes in Massachusetts suffered diagnosed concussions each year. That's a good question. We don't have good data on the diagnosis of concussion. What we do have is data from a survey of students, which showed us that about 18% said that they had had an injury to the head during sports that caused a number of symptoms that could be consistent with concussion. Now whether or not they were diagnosed with it, we don't know. But that was 18%, which is a lot of kids. the leader of reform in legal education and the leader in multimedia education for the public.

Our musical will closely follow the style of the original French production from 1980. We will not manipulate the plot or the music as we feel changes to such a widely recognized classic would not be well received by audiences. Our production of Les Misérables will incorporate the revolving stage element that has been used in some versions of the play to attract audiences. This will require a theater that can hold our specialized stage. The revolving stage has a large circular piece that actors and actresses can stand on while it rotates to create an interesting visual element. The scene director will need to make sure this can be incorporated into his design. Our play will be designed for all audiences, but it will be geared toward adult audiences due to the more mature content and language, as well as the fact that the play may be difficult to understand for younger children. As far as funding, one source we will count on is grants, consisting of those from local and international National Foundation. Some of these foundations are but not limited to the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Alliance for Musical Theatre and the BBC Performing Arts Fund. Our team will apply to these foundations in hopes of receiving a few grants. to build up excitement about the upcoming musical. A few changes will be made to the script, but some of the less crucial scenes will be shortened in order to create emphasis and time for scenes such as the opening work song, the barricade building scene, the master of the house scene, and Havara's soliloquy. A suggestion to the scene designer will be the incorporation of the revolving stage as well as an extravagant barricade prop for the barricade scenes. A suggestion to the costume designer will be to make the costumes, make sure the costumes are designed accurately to the time period so that the production is historically accurate as well as visually pleasing. A suggestion to the actors will be to make sure they study their roles inside and out and really imagine themselves as their respective characters for the duration of the production so that our show comes off as believable. My role in the production is to make sure every last detail is attended to and that there is communication between each person involved in the play. I also have to make sure a play is funded and well advertised so that the end result a successful show financially and that every audience enjoys the performance.","Our group chose to create a production of Les Miserables, a musical adapted from a French novel by Victor Hugo that has become famous and beloved around the world.

Así que aquí está Orquestra to Do para iOS y espero les guste. Lo primero que no ha trasladado la aplicación es, wow, que bien luz está up. En la parte de arriba de la pantalla tiene las opciones para visualizar tus tareas mediante listas, importancia y las personas a las que estén asignadas, de lo cual les hablaré un poco más adelante en el vídeo. En esta misma ventana puedes elegir algunas otras opciones como la lista en la que quieres que se guarde y en cuanto termines solo tocas el botón de la esquina de arriba y listo. Si tocas una tarea de la lista aparecerán más opciones, aún más dulces como la capacidad de la lista de la tarea de arriba. dejar un comentario y asignarla para cierta fecha. Algunas de estas opciones las puedes configurar rápidamente deslizando el dedo horizontalmente sobre la tarea para un fácil acceso. La mejor parte de orquestra es la parte colaborativa, como bien, sugiere su nombre. Cuando creas una nueva lista o editas alguna existente tiene la opción de añadir más personas a esa lista para que ambos puedan ver las tareas dentro de ella y colaborar entre ellos para terminar dichas tareas, algo así como un proyecto entre varias personas. También como una opción extra para hacer de esta función a algo algo aún más útil puedes asignar tareas a alguna persona en particular desde la ventana de crear una tarea nueva. Aquí les enseñó cómo funciona usando el celular de mi mamá cuando las asigno una tarea a alguien en específico dicha persona recibe casi inmediatamente la notificación de que alguien le pidió hacer una tarea de aquí la persona puede elegir hacerla o una hacerla o comentar dentro de ella para hacer un pequeño chat y aclarar dicha tarea. Para que esto funcione de hecho para usar orquestra en general debes tener una cuenta y cualquiera la puede hacer. Incluso si no cuenta con un dispositivo con iOS para nuestra fortuna existe la opción de usar orquestras desde la página web que es web.orquestra.com o mediante correr electrónico. A poco no es genial. En general, orquestras es una aplicación bastante buena que puede ayudarte a mejorar tu productividad de una manera que no habías experimentado antes. Gracias a la parte colaborativa también implementada por los desarrolladores. Los únicos aspectos malas que probablemente en alguna próxima actualización van a ser mejoradas en la opción de usar la app en español, especialmente la parte de añadir tareas por voz y tener mayor configuración a las notificaciones, ya que por ahora solo aparece una medalla en el icono de orquestra cuando tenemos algo en la bandeja de entrada y no las tareas para ese día. A pesar de esta es una aplicación que se ha vuelto parte de media a día y no dudo en recomendarla ampliamente a todos aquellos que quieran una herramienta para ser más eficientes. Yo le doy cuatro estrellas de 5 y si quieres probarla por tu cuenta puedes escanear este código QR en tu iPhone o dar clic en el enlace de abajo en la descripción. Bueno espero hayan disfrutado del video y si es asi por favor dejen su pulgar arriba y suscribanse para mas videos como este si no lo han hecho todavia Pero por el momento yo me despido yo soy Ivan en Michael Maxx y nos vemos en el proximo video","Hello everyone, I'm Ivan and in today's video we are going to take a look at the orchestra, a free application for iphone ipotouch with a great design to manage your personal tasks and collaborative projects so here is the orchestra to do for ios and I hope you like it. The first thing that you do not have to open the application is wow, what a good light is up, in the top of the screen you have the options to view your tasks through lists, importance and the people who are injured, of which I will talk a little more in the video. You can find the list of tasks in it, or depending on the option you have chosen in the top bar and below you find some more options, notifications, add a new task and preferences of the application. To add a new task you simply touch the big red button there and start writing. In this same window you can choose some other options, like the list in which you want it to be saved and when you finish you just touch the button on the top corner and that's it. If you touch a task of the list there will be more options, even more sweet as the capacity to leave a comment and continue it for a certain date. Some of these options can be quickly configured by sliding the finger horizontally on the task for easy access. The best part of the orchestra is the collaborative part, as well as suggesting a name. When you create a new list or edit some existing one, you have the option of adding more people to that list so that both can see the tasks within it and collaborate with them to finish these tasks, something like a project between several people. Also as an extra option to do this function to If you find something even more useful, you can assign tasks to someone in particular from the window to create a new task. Here I show you how it works using my mom's cell phone. When I assign a task to someone in specific, that person receives almost immediately the notification that someone asked him to do a task. From here the person can choose to do it or to do it or to comment on it to make a small chat and clarify that task. For this to work, in fact, to use the orchestra in general, you must have a account and anyone can do it, even if it does not have an iOS device, for our fortune there is the option to use orchestras from the web page which is web.orchestra.com or by running electronic, it is not great. In general, orchestra is a fairly good application that can help you improve your productivity in a way that you had not experienced before, thanks to the collaborative part also implemented by the developers, the only bad aspects that will probably be improved in some upcoming update in the option to use the app in Spanish, especially the part of adding tasks by voice and having greater configuration in notifications, since for now only a medal appears in the orchestra's icon when we have something in the input tray and no tasks for that day. Despite this is an application that has become part of media day and no doubt in recommending it widely to those who want a tool to be more efficient. I give you 4 stars of 5 and if you want to try it by your own you can scan this QR code on your iPhone or click on the link below in the description. Well, I hope you enjoyed the video, if so please leave a thumbs up and subscribe for more videos like this one, if you haven't done it yet. But for now I say goodbye, I'm Ivan, in Michael Maxx, and see you in the next video."

Era un poco más la idea de fondo política.","Next we are going to show you some of that summer blue of its protagonists before we are going to greet the three journalists who accompany me that do not remember that it did not start to be broadcast in summer activate the good morning price I did not remember it was summer and it started to broadcast one last October I do not know if it was so hot as now because I do not remember I remember that I was pregnant that if I remember it was a good memory Luisa was reading good morning how are you now we are also going to remember and with this palomera good morning that was the first one to ask for a good one I don't remember the name. It was the beginning of the new generation. I remember that. I remember that. It was from 1981 or 1982. I remember that. We started with that famous image of the dead chanquete that marked... I was going to say, a whole generation, a lie. It marked all those who saw those summer repositions 19 episodes on the web, 19. I remember more than one year of political events, but I saw it very intense. That year was the military coup, but I saw it very often when I was left with multiple activities. It was a good year, many news. We have wanted to see the doors of the newspapers appear and some of them collect that investigation for one of the directives of a savings box, refers to the exit to the camp and that dismissal that has made it take 370,000 euros. With that we started Nativelle. There is a revolt especially at the moment that we are going through this country with these indemnizations and with the responsibility. Now we are going to listen to what the popular and socialist party say. Is it one of the things that has brought the crisis that we have now realized what was happening in the boxes? Well, I am convinced that it could have been avoided and that both the autonomous leaders like the Bank of Spain had to have foreseen those shot-down salaries in financial institutions that have been helped by the State, that is to say, with the money of all the Spanish. I am absolutely convinced that there has been a drop in and that now the politicians or financial officials of the Bank of Spain, I say both, first one and then others, have a responsibility that they have not fulfilled, without a doubt, let's go. Now let's go to the responsibility of the Bank of Spain. I think that first of all, of course, to the Council of the Administration, but the autonomous governments, among which I included, I did it, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcava, I did it with great joy, the autonomous governments, thinking only about the legalice, the valence, that is what affects us at the moment, but we have already had a much more serious precedent that has been Castilla-La Mancha, that is, to the autonomous government of turn and then the Spanish Bank has an inspection service, I think that is dedicated only to that, then practically, almost all the responsibilities have already been removed except this one, the one of the watchmaker and it has not done it, it has not done it and then in the first place the autonomous governments and in second place the Spanish Bank, that is, the culprits are distributed to the 50% And you mentioned it, what do you think about your first declaration of your second matrication and this third one? I respect my respect to a person who controls the word a lot and his speeches and well, he is a respectable person who is the first one who has had electoral interests when he pronounced this phrase so unfortunate, not already about the per, the per that no longer exists, but well, we understand the per, but about the cafes and the That was the first statement. That was a very promising statement that was of course given to bad interpretation and of course to electoral interest. Something wanted Mr. Durán, he escapes the words because it is very precise in what he wants to say. Something wanted to win with that and he has obviously crushed it, although he has then apologized and tried to ... He has apologized in a very random way. Yes, because he has talked about killing the messenger, right? As if he ... He did not say what many people think. No, no, no, what the The government is not thinking about it because it is an offensive for the Andalusians. And also, the only thing they say in those terms is that they are offensive for a way of being Andalusian, which is very poorly understood. I think that what they say is to cut it off there, which I honestly think I am against because as I said, Luis, it is very little money for people who do not have another means of life, that is, I think it is very bad that it is cut off there and another thing is that it is criticized because there has been fraud but there is fraud as everywhere, it is that the fraud is persecuted but not in itself the agrarian subsidy to people who are in the precarious situation I I am absolutely against those cuts. There has been fraud that persists, but that does not play with that. We are going to listen to this side of the table, Nativelle, the rest of the questions. Well, I regret going back to the subject of terrorism, but I have heard you decide to make some statements that worry me a little compared to the situation in Uscadi with the one of the Nazi Germany in some sense. So do you think that after the process of peace, after that it disappears, you have to pursue how the Nazis are persecuted, we have to give them a hunt.

Once the ETA was over, we did not convert the good to the legitimate and pacifists to those of totalitarianism, because then we can have three years of five years of 20 years of diet to the new generations of basis that they say, that was not wrong, we return to it. My reflection was that it was less wrong that the totalitarianism idea of the Nazi was defeated, apart from ending with Hilder and his troops, because if not today Europe would be full of of Nazis and Nazis' governments. It was a bit more the political background idea."

It can be anything from waking up and feeling sluggish, which is quite often it takes me a while to get going and I've always got aches and pains when I wake up. I always have to have some sort of rest in the day, either by having the whole morning in bed and then coming to later on or perhaps going out doing some shopping or something, perhaps making making lunch or whatever and even sort of, even hoovering a room can completely tie me out and I have to sort of have a sleep afterwards or lie down. I'm a piano teacher and I only teach six pupils now. I've had to cut down because of my health and when I was teaching in schools I was picking up one bug after another because my immune system's quite suppressed. I wouldn't want to give up teaching completely because I really enjoy doing it and I want to do it for as long as I possibly can. was diagnosed with breast cancer and it was so I just moved to Wales and I'd given up my self-employed teaching practice in London. I felt I was sort of finished really musically and that I wasn't able to sort of go out and play and travel around like I was before and also I in a way turned my back on the piano to a certain extent because I think it became too painful to play because it's so much part of my life but since being diagnosed with a secondaries four years ago I've rediscovered my passion for music. Last year on a Wim I auditioned for the BBC National Chorus of Wales, an amateur choir, but with professional orchestra and I was thrilled to get in, not expecting it at all. And then I was asked to the first concert was the Verdi Requiem at the Albert Hall at the Prom's last July and it was amazing, just amazing experience. For me I never know whether I can actually do achieve these things in that I didn't even know if I could stand for the length of time required but I just do what I can at the time and I know that if it doesn't work out I'll just have to stop doing what I'm doing but I won't sort of stop planning or say oh I'm not going to do that in case I don't get well. I think well I'm an adult I can speak up if I'm not feeling very well people will understand. I have a very full social life I love to So I have lunch with people and people around for coffee and that sort of thing when I can. And if I've got something going on in the evening, then I try and rest in the day, probably in the afternoon. I'm not very good at making myself sleep in the day, but I do feel much better for it usually, and then it allows me to sort of perhaps be much brighter in the evening so that I can go out because I do enjoy going to the theatre, going to concerts, particularly classical concerts. And being as normal as I possibly can, but having to to allow for the fact that my health can be very up and down but it doesn't stop me planning for things and I've stopped the sort of guilty thought that people won't like it if I let them down or whatever because people understand they're completely fine with it and no I don't just sort of have to cancel willy-nilly they're just pleased that I want to sort of go out and want to keep things as normal as possible. I really find it great to have lots of things to look forward to all the time so that when I'm not feeling so well I've got something coming up very soon it just makes me feel better and even if I'm not feeling that great you know there's something to focus on other than my illness."

Pero esta ha sido una modificación que se esperó por mucho tiempo. y finalmente este gobierno decide redactar el proyecto y enviarlo al Congreso que es lo que corresponde para que se debate y de pronto sorprende que está bien cuando se es oposición la oposición tiene el objeto y el propósito, digamos su propósito principal o ponerse señalando lo que por ahí pueda ser inconveniente o negativo y está bien porque esto es lo que hace el juego democrático discutimos entre todos con sensuamos y se pueden aprobar los proyectos. Pero por ahí sorprende cuando hay oposición por la oposición misma. Yo recuerdo el senador Morales ya tiempo atrás, antes de que se conociera el proyecto, ya solía decir que si se aprobaba y sobre esto era Venezuela, y no se conocía todavía el proyecto. Entonces uno dice, bueno, es tan verdadera ¿En cuanto a la consulta más insistente por parte de los medios, como de la comunidad, de saber en qué beneficie y en qué no, porque uno escucha el debate desde un sector de la de la disponibilidad está en manos privadas. Un porcentaje menor, muy menor, en manos del Estado, que tiene el canal estatal y la radio nacional. A partir de la propuesta de esta ley, una de las disposiciones que propone ahí es la distribución del espacio radiofónico en tres partes, un 33% para manos privadas, un 33% para el Estado Nacional Provincial y Municipal y un 33% para las asociaciones civiles. Entonces, esto creemos nosotros que representa un vuelco pero muy criterioso y muy profundo en lo que es el uso del espectro radioeléctrico para la presencia de voces, de múltiples voces. Cuando esto está ¿Qué nos dice el Poder Geomónico sobre los medios? ¿Qué es lo que se ve diariamente como noticias? ¿Cierto? ¿Es lo que de algún modo uno reproduce o es lo que la mente de uno está ocupada? Hubiera, este hubo un asalto en la zona de Berizo como está 30 veces lo pasan por los canales de televisión. Claro, uno está preocupado porque dice bueno, fíjate que inseguridad que la hay, sin duda es todo, pero bueno, sí, machaca, machaca, machaca. Esto por darle un ejemplo, de algo que vemos todos los ciudadanos todos los días.","We are in the process of the EI, which will be replaced by the 22nd of 1985, and which would be called the EI of the Social Communication Service. We are absolutely agree because it is something that was expected for almost 30 years, let's say, that there is a change in that law that is currently managing the communications. The association of civil society, the people who take care of these issues, the citizens who are interested in them, have always marked this, that we cannot continue as a law of the dictatorship. There are others, in other areas, of the community that is still in the region, our days. But this has been a modification that was expected for a long time. and finally this government decides to redact the project and send it to the Congress, which is what corresponds to the debate. And suddenly it surprises that... It's okay when the opposition has the object and the purpose, let's say, its main purpose says, or it points out what can be inconvenient or negative, and it's okay because this is what the democratic game does. We discuss, among all, with a sense of and they can approve the projects. But that's why it surprises me when there is opposition for the opposition itself. I remember the Morales senator, a while ago, before the project was known, he used to say that if it was approved, this would be Venezuela. And the project was not known yet. So one says, well, it's so true. We are not only analyzing the project in favor of the best way of doing it, but also we are exaggerating the opposite of the opposite. and thus, let's say, it has been generalized in the public opinion, as if it favors a sector and does not favor another sector. And the citizen stays in the middle looking everywhere saying, well, but what is the end principle? Well, one of the central issues is radical, which is the reason for discussion too, the discussion of the air. At this moment, 90% of the The air of availability is in private hands. It is a very small percentage, very small. In the hands of the State, which has the State and the National Radio. From the proposal of this law, one of the provisions proposed there is the distribution of the radio-phonic space in three parts. It is a 33% for private hands. 33% for the National Provincial and Municipal State and 33% for the Civil Associations. This represents a very critical and profound role in the use of the radioelectric spectrum for the presence of voices, of multiple voices. What happens? Who marks the daily agenda of the topics that will be discussed? The one with the hegemony, the hegemonic power, about the media. What do the specialists say? They don't tell us how to think, but they do tell us what to think. So, you open up what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, what is heard, the ones that are seen daily as news, right? Is it what you reproduce or is the mind of one occupied? There was an assault in the area of Verizo, as it is 30 times, it is passed through the television channels. One is concerned because he says, well, look at that insecurity, that there is it, without a doubt, but if you crash, crash, crash, this is to give an example, of something that we see all citizens every day"

He also discusses how he has been successful in multiple offer situations.,"Multiple Offer Situations, Richard Senecal, Windermere",81,5,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/fY5d-jvZdas.mp3,"Tell me a little bit about I guess you know we just heard about how sellers are having a pretty good time out there and buyers of course are getting it stuck to them But what is the pace of the real estate market right now? I mean is it because it seems like it's really fast But at the same time there's not a lot of houses for sale So it's almost like hurry up and wait like everybody get to that house. Okay wait for the next one Everybody get to that house. Okay. Let's wait for the next one. Is that a fair rendition? Yeah, I think it does definitely is fair. Typically when I list a house, I set the expectation with my seller that we're going to come on on a Wednesday and we're going to look at offers on Tuesday. And typically what happens is I want... Wednesday to Tuesday. That's it. Six days. That's it. Six days. Six days. Okay. That's it. I was trying to make sure it wasn't the next day. Nope. Six days. So I want to have a double truck, open house, Saturday, Sunday. What's a double truck open house? Saturday and Sunday. A double truck? Double truck. Why is it called a double truck? You're both days. You're working both days. Wow. So I concentrate on just that listing for just that weekend. We, by the way, we have great metaphors going on today. The double, and I have never heard that. I like it. Yeah, double truck. So we do that. I try to get as many people through as possible. I send out, you know, 500 postcards to the nearest homes. We advertise the living, you know, out of it. I end up getting, you know, 100, 150 people through each time. By Tuesday, I've created frenzy and we've got multiple offers. And so when you have like say like you said 150 200 300 people come through over the course of a weekend during your double truck open house. I'm gonna hold that. I like it. It's all good. How many offers do you end up getting? Now on the last one we got nine. Okay. So the house came on it and I had a list of 549 950 which I thought was a pretty reasonable number. The escalation clauses actually went up to 6 50 mm-hmm and so I had two multiple escalation clauses that you know typically you're gonna weed out most of the offers they're gonna get down to two or three when it came down to it one was at 637 and That's what got it 637 five so when you start looking at these houses when people buyers are going through these houses How important is is the attention to detail that a seller must I suppose provide on their house because if you have a frenzy and You know it's kind of I think of a frenzy as almost you know you take a handful of Fish food and you throw it in like the koi pond and there's like a frenzy for it Don't ask me why that's my mental picture of frenzy, but it is that's good. It doesn't have to be the best fish food It's just the stuff that comes out for a quarter in this case Do all the fish or all the buyers flock to the flock to the house regardless of if it's in the best shape Or does it just have to be a handful of quarter food? No, I think you're it's it's really important to stage the house ahead of time They're smarter than fish. about it in the monologue with Marcus Truffaut, things are coming up, life happens, there's reasons people need to get into a house. How vicious do these frenzies get? How many people can be involved? How common are they really? I'd say they're very common, especially in the close-in knit areas. Anything core, Seattle, Kirkland, Redmond, Bellevue, it's happening frequently. Getting a house bid up 25 to 50, 75,000 over is almost common. And especially when you make it pretty yeah, you know staging is critical It really is I mean, you know you got to get your cellar on board, you know, hey, I'm gonna come into your house I'm gonna I'm gonna get rid of most of your stuff Okay, I don't care if it's in the garage or wherever it is, but we're gonna make it nice and clean sparse model home Fresh flowers, you know trinkets here and there make it look good. Mm-hmm. It works Seahawks memorabilia. That's what I always would look for maybe if you were down by the rent and training complex I want to buy a house there just so I can be closer and believe it or not Richard so when so when people are then? Barcing up their house making it more attractive What can they then expect? I mean what is the process they should expect that you say that you give people? Basically six days so it's like this six-day waiting period and should they expect offers to come in sooner than That's six days. I mean is there is there anything that pulls on their heartstrings before you say you're going to look at offers? It really depends I find that most of the more savvy agents will wait to the last day and then submit because they don't want to play their cards early But sometimes the best offer comes in early and nobody trumps it. Mm-hmm, but typically it they'll come in the last day Yeah, and so when you look at those buyers offers that are getting accepted whether it's at the beginning or end What sacrifices do you see buyers really having to make? Waving their inspection. Number one. More important than more money or anything. Not in order necessarily. Waving inspection. That's one headache the seller doesn't have to deal with. Number two would be strong financing. Which almost hand in hand with that. I want to see conventional financing at least 20% down with room to go forward in case the appraisal doesn't come in. you determine that? Join us realtor with Windermere real estate um What so with sellers right now you have these you create these by these frenzy of buyers and sellers of course or You know we hear it all the time well should I sell should I not because of course if if the numbers are true and potentially houses are quite at 1% a month right now It's really tough to sell when you're thinking well geez if I wait six months that could be 6% or 10 or a year I could be up another 10% What is what becomes I guess the biggest? to get people off the fence? You know, I don't think any of us have a crystal ball as far as, you know, how long are we going to sustain this? Right? But based on what's going on now with a perfect storm, we've got a 16 year loan inventory, we've got the best rates we've ever had, we've got a great economy, and we've got a true, you know, pool of buyers, you know, one home for every 10 buyers, and you know, are outpacing new listings almost three four to one if you check the multiple on a daily basis. I don't see how it won't sustain for at least the next year if not two at this pace. So here'd be I guess my question you say there's maybe ten to one buyers to sellers or whatever that number is called seven ten whatever the number is. In some ways you might think as a seller geez maybe I should wait until it's three to one or two to one where I can still create a small frenzy but I allow those prices to come up. I mean is that a fair Way of going at it. I know it's tough because you're like it's a great time to sell There's no doubt, but of course trying to balance those two pieces Can make it a much tougher decision for people. Yeah, I would I would definitely agree with that You know because we are going about 1% every month and I've had sellers For instance, I put a place on and in bridal trails last week and it was listed at just under a million dollars and I Got a full price offer the first week. Okay, I did my job got everything they wanted Turns out these folks wanted multiple offers. When we didn't get it, it was kind of a turn off to them and they pulled it off the market, even though they got a million dollars. So in some ways they had a little bit of buyer or sellers remorse based on the fact they didn't get quite the anticipated frenzy. The coin weren't coming from the pond to eat the food. You know, you gotta set your sellers expectations up front and sometimes, you know, in that price point it's just not quite the same because we're dealing with a much smaller pool of buyers that can actually afford a million dollars. Sure, sure. I mean I imagine if you go buy a house on Lake Washington, you know, say Hunts Point for 10 million, there's probably not 22 people who are serious buyers on that. We're talking about a completely different market. Yeah. Okay, if you get one offer at that price point, hey, good for you. Right. You found that guy. Yeah, exactly. Right. And that's kind of how I thought him on this last one. People were knocking down the door. Right. We had one. Right. And they were willing to pay full price. Yeah. But, hey, what are you going to do?","Tell me a little bit about I guess you know we just heard about how sellers are having a pretty good time out there and buyers of course are getting it stuck to them But what is the pace of the real estate market right now?

We've been having really bad storms here in Queensland Australia and a little bit of flooding so that's fun for everyone. However this video is not about weather otherwise you'd all be asleep by now. It is about me clearing up some stuff about my muscular dystrophy. Now to me my MD didn't warrant a video like this but since I I've had lots of questions and a few people are getting a few things mixed up. So I thought I would clear and clarify some things for those who aren't sure what muscular despair is or are interested or don't give a crap but just want to listen to the rain and an Australian accent for a little while. Now a lot of people get mixed up with MD and MS. I suffer from a lot of stress and anxiety. from MD, muscular dystrophy. MS is multiple sclerosis and that attacks your nerves whilst muscular dystrophy attacks your muscles. I don't think one is better or worse than the other, seeing as though they both come in varying degrees. Speaking of degrees, everyone who suffers from muscular dystrophy suffers differently. There is no prognosis. A doctor can't say to me, look in five years you out of move anything. It could be 50 years or it could be six months from now. So it's kind of all up in the air regarding what your life's going to be like. But I think that's a good thing because if someone were to tell me, look in six months you're not going to be able to lift your own head then I would freak out and not feel very good. So maybe it's a good thing not knowing. It is a genetic disease so don't worry people, you can sit close to me or even touch me and you won't catch it. Each parent needs to have a recessive gene so that every time they have a child there's a 25% chance of that child having muscular dystrophy. I'm one of four children and I'm the only one with muscular dystrophy so I guess I hit the jackpot. Muscular dystrophy is quite rare, you could say, in the grand scheme of disabilities that are out there. mostly it occurs in boys which is strange because I'm hopefully obviously not a boy. It's kind of rare for it to hit women so yay. What else? It affects pretty much everything from the neck down so I will never lose my voice. Thank God, life would not be worth living if I could not chatter or chew someone's ear off. So yeah, basically it affects the main muscles of your body by the proteins breaking down faster than usual and basically rendering them just kind of weak and useless. And it also gives weird looks to your body. If you looked at me normally you wouldn't know that I have it. But when I start pointing out little things like I have weird angular shoulder bones they're called angel wings for those who like to dress up their disease. by calling it cute things. So I have really bony shoulder blades. Not much fat, well not much muscle, so therefore quite skinny. And most of what my body is is fat because my muscle is wasting away. So I'm quite skinny because I have no muscle really. So you might think that's a good thing but I think I'd rather have muscles than be skinny. functioning in any way so it's not going to affect my intelligence or wit or anything like that. However it is somewhat correlated and associated with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder which I have found to be somewhat correct. It was explained to me in terms of, okay, your muscles are wasting away. You don't have any control over that. However you do have control over colour coding everything. So that is what I do. And there are certain things that I don't like having been messed with. I like my own company, my own things, my own bathroom, my own bed. I get quite freaked out when I have to stay in a hotel room or something like that that I'm not comfortable with. So little bits of OCD do come out a little bit, but not to the extent that I need professional help for. just a thing that comes with not having any control over your own health or life. So you project that control onto something else. Mobility and independence does get harder. I find it quite amusing that throughout all my videos, my wheelchair, let's see it right there, let's have a look. You can see it just under my arm there. See the wheel there? My wheelchair has been sitting behind me the whole time. I've somewhat learned how to hide it, but when you're out in the real world and not behind a camera, it's hard to hide a chair with giant wheels. So my ability is hard. I need to get driven everywhere. Obviously I can't drive. Being independent is really hard and it can get upsetting sometimes when you are a young adult and you want to to go out and do whatever you want and do whatever young adults want to do these days. And you're limited to how long you can stay out because your muscles get sore, how fair it is to ask the person who is driving you around how long you want to stay out. So it does get hard but I suppose if I didn't do that I'd be stuck in my bedroom all day which you don't want because then you get into the depressive cycle. So yeah, there are some pretty sucky components to MD. My favourite comment after I revealed it on my 8th collaboration video was, do you have legs? Yes I have legs. My body is anatomically correct in every way except for the kind of fudged upness of the muscles inside. So as I said, looking at me you wouldn't guess, but I think you would guess if I had no legs. of the fact that I had no legs. Anyway, I thought I'd just clear up a few things, maybe add a little bit more information for those who don't know. Please, if you do go and Google it, don't... It's hard to explain. Take everything with a grain of salt because a lot of websites out there will say, most MD sufferers don't live past the age of 30. Now, I have a different strain of it, which means that it won't necessarily affect my longevity. So as long as I keep healthy I should live to a reasonably old age. So please don't freak out if you go and look for it out of interest and find that most of the doctors say that I'll be dead before 30 because I won't. Hopefully not anyway. So yeah, I hope that answers some of the questions. If you have any, don't be afraid to post them or Twitter me at FearBlandness or message me because I would much rather people know about it rather than assume things. Because assuming things makes people really embarrassed when they get it wrong, makes me angry when they assume wrong things about me, and it's just easier to ask and I'm happy to answer. So yeah, just thought I'd make a little info video. Thanks guys!","Hello everyone, as you can probably hear it is a little bit windy and rainy outside. We've been having really bad storms here in Queensland Australia and a little bit of flooding so that's fun for everyone. However this video is not about weather otherwise it'll be a sleep by now. It is about me clearing up some stuff about my muscular dystrophy. Now to me my MD didn't warrant a video like this but since I I've had lots of questions and a few people are getting a few things mixed up. So I thought I would clear and clarify some things for those who aren't sure what muscular dyspheria is or are interested or don't give a crap but just want to listen to the rain and an Australian accent for a little while. Now a lot of people get mixed up with MD and MS. I suffer from a lot of dyspheria. from MD, muscular dystrophy. MS is multiple sclerosis and that attacks your nerves whilst muscular dystrophy attacks your muscles. I don't think one is better or worse than the other, seeing as though they both come in varying degrees. Speaking of degrees, everyone who suffers from muscular dystrophy suffers differently. There is no prognosis. A doctor can't say to me, look in five years you out of move anything. It could be 50 years or it could be six months from now. So it's kind of all up in the air regarding what your life's going to be like.

Как сообщили порталу Мой МД в Министерстве экономики, четыре тендерных предложения были поданы консорциумами, два отдельными фирмами. Победитель тендера будет определён до 27 августа, когда и планируется начать строительные работы. Планируется, что в церемонии начала работ примет участие Еврокомиссар по энергетике Гюнтер Эттингер. Генн и Ясы должен обеспечить взаимоподключение газовых сетей Румынии и Молдовы и позволит транспортировать до полутора миллиардов кубометров природного газа в год. Его общая протяженность составит 43 километра, 11 из которых будет проложена по территории Республики Молдова. В правительстве говорят, что новый газопровод будет способствовать укреплению энергобезопасности Молдовы, а также диверсификации источников и маршрутов поставок природного газа. Однако на данный момент Румыния не располагает свободным газов чтобы качать его по газопроводу ангенойасы. Некоторые эксперты называют газопровод ангенойасы мертвым проектом, не способным обеспечить Молдове газовую альтернативу.","The construction of the Moldavian part of the gas pipeline of the Ungeno Yats is expected by six companies from five countries, Austria, Italy, Romania, Turkey and Moldova. As the MDA portal was reported, the Ministry of Economics had four tender proposals, two separate firms were given consortium. The winner of the tender will be determined by August 27, when construction work is planned. It is planned that the European Commission on Energy, Günther Ettinger, will take part in the work at the beginning of the ceremony. The U.N. gas pipeline should provide access to the gas networks of the Moldovs and allow transport to 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Its total length will be 43 kilometers, 11 of which will be laid in the territory of the Republic of Moldova. The government says that the new gas pipeline will contribute to strengthening the energy security of the Moldovs, as well as diversification of sources and routes to supply natural gas. However, at the moment, the Romanian does not have a free gas to pump it on the gas pipeline of the gas tank. Some experts call the gas pipeline of the gas tank a dead project, unable to provide the Moldova gas alternative."

It is because I have two bone spurs in my neck. This past January I had to go to the hospital because I lost function in my body. I couldn't move my left arm. Everything was going numb. So I went to the hospital and they were able to get an MRI of my neck finally. and it showed that I had a bone spur on my C3 vertebrae on both sides actually. My doctor's pretty surprised that I have this. He says it's unusual for people my age to get bone spurs. I don't really see why because it's just a buildup of calcium and I don't see how it's related to age. We know for sure it's causing nerve damage and it's causing pain and numbness down the left side of my body. But in order to fix that they're gonna have to do surgery and that's pretty risky. They'd have to split it up into three sections. They have to do one surgery and one surgery and one surgery. for each bone spur so my neck doesn't swell and I don't have complications afterwards. After that they have to clear out an area in the vertebrae called the formina and that is where your nerves go through. If you've seen an actual picture of your spine it's where your spine opens up to allow the nerves to go through through and into the rest of your body. That's being pressured into being smaller because of the bone spurs and they're going to have to clear out that area to allow the nerves to pass through without problem. I was able to get insurance. It's not the greatest but it'll help a lot. It'll help pay for for the surgery and hopefully it'll help us with other past ER visits that I've had because of my pre-existing condition. But other than that, nothing's really been too interesting around here. I was able to get a 360. I've been playing Oblivion for the past week nonstop. I wish I could get Skyrim but I don't have money for that. My Therian group, Toha, is going very well. We reached 100 members. That's pretty exciting. I didn't even think it would get that big. I thought it would get maybe to like 20 people that I knew online. But they spread the word and it's gotten better. It's awesome. I'm still trying to spread the word. It's really important that it's not important that we get accepted, but it's important to realize that we, Azarians and other kin, we are pretty much human in body and we have to be able to coexist with other people. in order to survive and then you can't live alone forever and You know if this ever got out into the mainstream public I meant and then mainstream not just YouTube There's tons of videos on YouTube and half of them aren't taken seriously enough but if it ever got into the news and People didn't really know what it was. We would be ostracized badly Just like the LBGT community, they're still fighting for equal rights. We just want to be. We don't want to corrupt little children or all that other bad stuff. We don't kill people. We don't go out and run naked in the woods or anything. We have jobs, we have lives. families and people need to realize we're just like them. We just have a different, you know, belief. And now that's hard to do in this day and age, but somehow we'll manage. That's about it. Nothing else has been going on recently, so I guess I'll just end this off here. And just, I hope, you pray that everything is going to happen as it should and I'll talk to you later.

I don't really see why because it's just a buildup of calcium and I don't see how it's related to age. We know for sure it's causing nerve damage and it's causing pain and numbness down the left side of my body. But in order to fix that they're gonna have to do surgery and that's pretty risky. They'd have to split it up into three sections. They have to do one surgery and then they have to do the other. for each bone spur so my neck doesn't swell and I don't have complications afterwards. After that they have to clear out an area in the vertebrae called the formina and that is where your nerves go through. If you've seen an actual picture of your spine it's where your spine opens up to allow the nerves to go through through and into the rest of your body. That's being pressured into being smaller because of the bone spurs and they're going to have to clear out that area to allow the nerves to pass through without problem. I was able to get insurance. It's not the greatest but it'll help a lot. It'll help pay for for the surgery and hopefully it'll help us with other past ER visits that I've had because of my pre-existing condition. But other than that, nothing's really been too interesting around here. I was able to get a 360. I've been playing oblivion for the past week non-stop. I wish I could get Skyrim but I don't have money for that. My Therian group, Toha, is going very well. We reached 100 members. That's pretty exciting. I didn't even think it would get that big. I thought it would get maybe to like 20 people that I knew online. But they spread the word and it's gotten better. It's not important that we get accepted, but it's important to realize that we, as Therians and other Ken, we are pretty much human in body. And we have to be able to coexist with other people. In order to survive and then you can't live alone forever and You know if this ever got out into the mainstream public I meant and then mainstream not just YouTube There's tons of videos on YouTube and half of them aren't taken seriously enough but if it ever got into the news and People didn't really know what it was. We would be ostracized badly just like the LBGT community. They're still fighting for equal rights and we just want to leave. We don't want to corrupt little children or all that other bad stuff. We don't kill people. We don't go out and run naked in the woods or anything. We have jobs. We have lives. families and people need to realize we're just like them. We just have a different, you know, belief. And now that's hard to do in this day and age, but somehow we'll manage. That's about it. Nothing else has been going on recently. So I guess I'll just end this off here. And just, I hope you pray that everything is going to happen as it should and I'll talk to you later. Bye!"

Blank, giocate in modalità, croni. Puoi giocare con più alleati. Noi in questo caso siamo in due. Il soggettivo è di illuminare tutti i nemici, vuoi tagliare molti punti. La difficoltà aumenta in base ad un nemico. Più i nemici uccidi più la difficoltà aumenta. C'è il tempo. I nemici le possiamo assare quanti ne vuoi. Infatti il tempo è limitato. il mio nickname di server in Italia è Emanuele 1995 e... guarda adesso vediamo che muoio da una granata che ha partito dura poco e già iniziata perché la prima parte non so come mai non l'ho registrata o cioè se l'ho registrato l'ho persa comunque adesso le spavuniamo un ginocchio aumenta la precisione infatti l'abbiamo fatto fuori vediamo che adesso sono tantini e hanno ripreso il concerto la città siamo a 100 kg aumenta la difficoltà siamo a livello normale penso che sia questa la parte dove faccio spiedino cioè con un progetto e un energie di so2 intanto sotto le stelle sotto accanto all'energia fatto spiedino tanto l'energia serve a le donne già le stelle accanto all'energia sono quelle che danno dicono il numero di nemici che ne ho scelto mi ero scattenato non mi fermavo più Vedi che il mio amico vuole sempre armi da salto e che sta sempre in avanti. Non lo conosco, lo conosco solo sul server. Sui server italiani. Io non compro niente con il soldi vero, sono le armi che mi dà il gioco e qui compro quelle che posso comprare con i punti, contenuti da questo gioco qua per esempio. Questa tipo di giocata qua ho tempo, molti punti che posso sfruttare. Però molti più punti li otteniamo quando giochiamo con il cendolo e il minuto. che sono delle carte che dice di fare delle lezioni per esempio due kill con un fucile d'accialto, tre kill con un tragiatore, un tragiatrice così, due headshot così e ti dà molti punti quando arrivi in punto da anche 10.000 punti così e poi comprare molte armi. Questi armi costano opponare i gestoni che devi comprare con le mone con un soldi veri oppure gli acquisti tramite punti come vi dicevo però per avermi war si vogliamo 10.000 punti e così. e mi hanno fatto fuori a me adesso. Siamo atti a termine finita, abbiamo una vittoria no? Spera. Il mio amico ha più punti, più kill di me perché ha iniziato a giocare prima di me. Io sono entrato e la partita era già inizierda. Ora vediamo quanti... Quante kill ho io. E dura giusto un attimo per vedere le kill. Vediamo quanti kill ho io e niente mi saluto. Il prossimo live commentary se ne accorti da la possibilità. Spero che farò altri gameplay, altri live commentary mentre gioco a Point Blank, in altre missioni, anche in missione esplosiva, deathmatch squadre, in distruzioni, altre cose che possiamo fare. Spero che vi sia piaciuto il video e ciao e a presto un saluto da Killemano03.","Hello to all my friends, I'm Kill and I'm 1-0-3 I'm here today on the community of Melagodon, to give you a live commentary on my game at Point Blank. I'm sorry if the comment is not the best because the first one is for a community so big. I hope you all like the kills. This is a game of the... You can play in the same way as the other players, you can play with more allies, you can play in 2, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can kill as many enemies as you want, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, you can use the enemy to kill you, My nickname in Italy is Emmanuel1995 Now I'm dying from a grenade, it's been a long time since I started, I don't know how I never recorded it, I mean I recorded it but I lost it anyway, now I'm respawning, a knee increases the precision and we did it out of the box We have 100 kills, we have difficulty, we have normal level I think this is the part where I do a spear, that is with a projectile in the first two While under the stars under the energy field I do spear, the energy field is used in the energy fields The stars next to the energy field are the ones that give damage, say the number of enemies that I killed I was scared, I did not stop I have a lot of points, I have a lot of things to do. Now let's see what happens when I hit and I have only armed with pistol because I finished the rifle of the gun and I have the same pistol as the K5. I put the gun inside the house and my friend who lives there, I disappeared mysteriously, I never knew, I left my friend. I know that he is also dying, I'm fine, let's hope I escape, something I don't have to do. I managed to kill him and they made me out of him. We are almost done, we have a victory, no wait. My friend has more kills than me because he started to play before me. I entered and the game started. Now let's see how many kills I have. It takes just a moment to see the kills. Let's see how many kills I have. Well, I say goodbye. See you in the next live commentary if you agree to give me the possibility. I hope you liked the video, see you soon, a greeting from Kill your hands 030"

This broke the yoke of 700 years rule of the invading forces from the Arab countries. Their myth of power was broken by him.

Passing through very difficult times for the next 40 years, the sikhs ruled at Lahore under the leadership of Nawab Kapoor Singh and then by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia in 1756. Later on they ruled all over Punjab in the form of 12 Sikh Misels (groups) under different names.

Nicky's mum was having a party in the back garden of her house on Spencer Place and it was full of all manner of mad-eds and odd balls, hippies and yuppies, posh girls and root boys. Even a few amiable low-level gangster types passed through during the night. It was wild. It was an optimistic, if slightly naive, time despite the fact that what would become club culture was in the process of being shooed away from the great outdoors into regulated licensed clubs. I'll tell you my theory about the great narco conspiracy between the Tories and the brewing industry and the Colombian drug cartels but we don't really have the time. OK, if you insist. By the late 80s the US cocaine market had reached saturation point. Everyone was at it by all accounts. And like any business, facing a level and offing profits, the cartels had developed new products. Crack was cheap, cheerful and highly addictive. But even with this new improved formula, the cartels were moving as many units as they were ever going to. They needed to develop some new markets. Europe was the obvious place to start but rave culture in the UK was all about ecstasy a single pill would keep you up all night your average rave simply didn't need cocaine and the product couldn't afford it anyway. As they sought oblivion via the traditional British weekend pursuit of getting absolutely leathered growing numbers of people were buying ecstasy rather than the Eamon drink booze was for the morning after rather than the night before like weed the big brewers were major donors to the Conservative Party and exactly like Pablo Escobar They weren't going to take a dipping profit lying down. They had a word. tomorrow. Meanwhile the quality of ecstasy available in this country dropped dramatically. All just a big coincidence right? Anyway we were in this period of transition but it was early days yet. In Leeds the stick was being applied liberally by the forces of Law and Order. About a year earlier a thousand people had been arrested at party up the road in Guildsham. But the carrot of later opening hours was still a few years away. In the meantime clubs shut up 2am and if sleep was absolutely out of the question you'd probably end up at Blues in Chapel Town but not tonight. As you go to some skanky blues when you could be in the open air dancing around a bonfire to local hotshots like Dickson, DJ Drew from the Astoria and Rob DeSera who was then king of the big Italian piano tune, it went off. a big barmy bullbugger embasted. Huggy had a real likeness to Touch. His nimble, intuitive mixing seamlessly merged such genuine rave classics as Neverland by Matta Grosso, Out There by Friends of Matthew and even Charlie by the Prodigy into one gloriously correct but tripped-out hall. scene relaxed, free and easy. But that night was the first time I saw cocaine on the scene, though it was perhaps as much to do with my woefully low socioeconomic status as much as anything else. There was definitely an edge. I was oblivious to the ghostly figures looming out of the shadows drawn to the bonfire like moths. As well as hosting a thriving sex industry, Spencer Place was also a bit of an open-air drug market and drew remember's various cadaverous crackheads crashing the party like so many extras from Dawn of the Dead. At the time nobody actually realised that the night was one big metaphor for the evolution of dance culture, or we might have taken more notice. I bought the record review bootleg with a dub of hip hop from Steve Luigi's shop a few months later, but the first few bars of the track were missing and I was always a little unsatisfied. Uggie had played a vocal version too. Years afterwards I moved to Charlton in Manchester and my first day there I walked into bus stop records, looked in the classic house section and there it was right at the front under a tenor, second hand but in Goodnick, original US pressing, Rizul. A couple of years later me and Kenny, a DJ and in leads The party itself is a little bit oaky-cokey and it's sad to see our far down hill-eyed park has gone. As we negotiate a landscape of dog shit and broken glass, some local kids chuck bricks at us. We go back to someone's house, inheadingly, afterwards. Leave a couple of record bags in the car and they get robbed. I lose hip-hop as well as many other much-loved vinyl treasures. It was a crappy night all around real. I ended up buying hip-hop yet again on Gem a couple of years ago but it's an Australian reshoot which looks like it's been manufactured with about half as much of the vinyl as the copy that I originally had. It's warped, it's not very loud and it's difficult to queue up and yeah, I blame the Tories."

That is called implant where we cannot touch the adjacent teeth. So, where we do not touch the adjacent teeth, so there is no problem for the patient. They will know it of thinking of the adjacent tooth gets spoiled or not. 8 departments in our dental field, one is Exodanshya, Androdanshya, Pedodanshya, Prostodanshya, Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine and Oral Pathology. 8 departments and different patients come to us, different problems. We will be treating them, first we will take them to Oral Medicine and we will diagnose the patients and then we will send the patient to different part of the departments. Then we will be seeing them and according to their diagnosis we will be treating the patient. In India, actually patients should visit a dentist once in six months, but nobody is visiting the dentist. So the problems will be increasing. Otherwise they get treatment if they go every six months. They get proper treatment done. Specialty treatment, each specialist will treat the patient according to their department. Suppose the patient comes to an ambulance shop with a severe tooth pain. The doctor will treat the patient according to the pain and he will take X-ray. And the patient, the tooth is decayed too much. and this is the treatment will be given as root canal treatment and after that once the root canal treatment is over the patient should be covered with the crown whether that is a ceramic crown or a calcine crown or a gold crown any crown that be covered because for the patient safe the protection of the crown protection of the tooth only. So and next is replacement for those patients they get some extracted somewhere else and they come to our clinic to replace the treatment. the patient to the procerer and share department so that the patient will be treated at a patient's field and vision. If the patient wants ceramic, they'll go for ceramic, carol, procerer. There are different materials are there. According to their wish, they go for that treatment."

Me parece bien que se haya provocado y que se debate y que esté bueno que podamos decir las cosas sin hipocresía. Pero es legal hoy tener una planta marihuana en la casa. Mira, la verdad es que lo que dice el fallo de la Corte Suprema es que menos de un gramo, que si yo lo consumo personal es legal y que la tendencia para consumo personal es legal. Y lo que dice la mayoría de los que trabajan en la casa es que no tienen la intención de provocarlo. por ejemplo el mismo un cués de la fuerte es que es preferible el autocultivo porque esto de alguna manera va contra las redes narcotráficas. No, está bien, no está bien. El autocultivo para el consumo personal es legal, digamos, puede ser perseguido penalmente. No, está bien, lo que pasa es que como el planteo venía por lado de siendo una legisladora, si uno puede hacer, si puede, si puede, sacando una foto y exhibiendo algo que tenés en tu casa, entrasen un terreno de la apología o no. Agar, primero, si no hay delito no hay apología del delito. y si vas a tener para consumo personal no es delito por lo tanto es apología del delito. Después además te digo en este caso en particular que esta es una planta que me regalaron en un debate político en un debate en el que precisamente presentábamos el proyecto de penandización de la marihuana del senador Aníbal Fernández en un debate en los chuperos donde está Muzaní, Valilio, Cristian Alarcón, Yrushanqui y Alex Freire y Alex me regaló esta planta que es los que conocen algo del tema, suavemente plantas maixos y hembras, las plantas que no tienen flor, con las plantas macho y por lo tanto no sirven para nada. Las plantas que te las con el césar calamari, bueno, son de la flor digamos, entonces solo tenés sustancias y tenés plantas sembras con flores. En este caso es una planta macho que es una planta de adorno, una planta ornamental que es como si me dijeras que porque tenés plantas de coca en tu casa cuando tenés cocaína digamos, o que tenés una mappola, vas a tener heroína digamos, no. No tiene nada que ver una cosa con la otra. Me parece que lo que está bueno y al mismo tiempo es que es raro que de la segunda pero ya se nos va el programa pero que dejar de tocar el tema gracias eh. Gracias por el avance un beso. Ciao. Gabriela Serruti, legisladora de nuevo encuentro. Caravana.","I never had the intention of provoking anything, but I never had anything, so I probably had the intention of provoking it. I think it is important to provoke and make this debate and that it is good that we can do things without hypocrisy. But is it legal to have a marijuana plant at home? Look, the truth is that what the Supreme Court's failure says is that less than a gram of personal consumption is legal and that the tendency for personal consumption is legal. And what it says, most of those who work in the For example, the same Cuerda Forte, Safari, is preferable to the self-cultivation, because this somehow goes against the networks of the drug trafficking. No, it's fine. For self-cultivation, for personal consumption, it is legal. It can be perceived as a penalty. No, it's fine. As I was saying, if you can take a picture and display something you have in your house, do you enter a territory of the Apology or not? and if you are going to have personal consumption, it is not a crime, therefore, it is a pathological crime. Then, in this particular case, I also tell you that this is a plant that was given to me in a political debate, in a debate in which we precisely presented the project of penalization of the marijuana of Senator Aníbal Fernández, in a debate in the Chuperos where we were in Iba, and Iba, Cristiana Alarcón, and Ruchanski, and Alex Freire, and Alex gave us this plant, here those who know something about the topic, they know that there are plants, males and females, plants that do not have flowers, and therefore it is not useful for anything. The plants that you have, the marihuana is from the flower, so you only have substances and you have plant seeds with flowers. In this case it is a male plant, which is a ornamental plant, which is like, if you tell me, because you have coconut plants in your house, when you have cocaína, you have a butterfly, you will have heroin, let's say, no. It has nothing to do with the other one. It seems to me that what is good and at the same time that it is rare, and that the media do a similar topic and a similar standard from a tweet and a photo when all those who come working on the issue of the marijuana explanation for so long and there are projects presented to them and there are debates all the time, the congress, there are revista that are on the topic and meetings around the topic, it is very difficult for the subject to be presented in public debate, in journalistic debate and suddenly with something that appears on Twitter and this is the mask of Twitter without a doubt, something that turns on this way. but it's already going to the program but I wanted to stop playing the song thanks to the band, I'm going to open the serruti and the new meeting"

Hello, I'm Park Bok-mi, an image consultant. I always emphasize the word Bok-ja when I say my name. I gave you the first lecture of the interview last time. I will briefly tell you how to look at the interview and how to greet the audience. Have you ever seen what Jo Seung-woo does in the Wook Choi-guk exhibition? Jo Seung-woo is very repetitive in practice. Before we start practicing today, there is a reason why you should keep paying attention to what you see and why you should pay attention to your body. People only try to believe in what they see. They remember the visual aspect of the body for a long time. If you are able to say goodbye to your competition and if you did well in polite way, you can also get the plus alpha effect. Let's say hello. Where did you put the word hello? Where? Yes, I put it on the floor. Do you do this? Hello? Why did you put this word on the floor? The other person is over there. Look at the other person's face and ask her, hello. I'll give you a tip. Don't forget to do the eye contact. Don't forget to look at him and talk about him. I contact means I respect you. I'm emphasizing it. What is the interview? I emphasize it twice. The interview is your production. If you practice and prepare, it will have a 100% good effect. Be sure to be with the mirror. Thank you."

Un poco los convoco hoy porque me veo en cierto modo la obligación de aclarar unas cosas ante la contestación que hemos recibido un poco radical ante las declaraciones que hicimos en la semana anterior. En realidad, quiero ser muy corto y muy breve porque creo que estas cosas no construyen y simplemente creo que la gente está creando otra cosa de la área de salud y no que estemos en este tipo de discusiones. Quiero decir que a la fecha de hoy el hospital no tiene la bilitación. Puede decirse lo que se diga porque la bilitación no está. Dice que pueden refutar nuestras declaraciones, a la fecha como les digo no tiene la bilitación y desde el 2009 se está reclamando la misma desde el ministro de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Universidad de la y si bien han hecho algunas gestiones, las gestiones no están terminadas. En cuanto a los equipamientos, en cuanto a lo que se llama política de Estado, la política de Estado en este caso la estamos ejercitando nosotros al darle continuidad a los equipamientos que la gestión anterior puso dentro del hospital y nosotros tenemos la obligación de ponerlos en marcha. Nosotros en salud, tanto la gestión anterior como nosotros somos menos administradores, no somos los dueños de los equipos ni los dueños de las cosas. Así que simplemente quería aclarar estas cosas, creo que un poco se ha sobreactuado con el tema de repudiarnos y ese tipo de historias. Y vuelvo a decir simplemente que creo que la gente está esperando otra cosa tanto de nuestra gestión como de la oposición. Así que con esto pretendo dar por termina ¿Por qué no está la habitación? de la estructura hospitalaria en el 2010 y quedó en eso y se hicieron trámites y gestiones por parte de la dirección anterior pero bueno no se culminaron. Así que al día de hoy la habilitación no está. Cuando se terminan. No se terminan porque no se hizo trámites correspondientes porque es de una demora burocrática. No se terminó un trámite correspondiente. En una parte ellos hablan también de que nosotros con estas declaraciones confundimos a la población y en realidad que en ningún momento nosotros dijimos que por la falta de habilitación el hospital dejaba de atender al público ni que se clausuraba en ningún momento dimos ese tipo de cosas sino que eso lo mencionan ellos y un poco también creo que el titular del semanalio reflejo que dice se denuncia la falta de habilitación del hospital en realidad no fue una denuncia fue una conferencia de prensa en donde entre otras tantas cosas se habló de la visita siempre. ¿Lo de usted habló de una trampa casabuco? ¿Ven encontrado cuando se hicieron caros por el vídeo? Sí, sí, pero a hacer una denuncia nosotros no hemos hecho denuncia a ninguna institución ni sanitaria ni nada. Pero no hubiera que se denuncia de un comentario... Tampoco fue el requisito de la periodística, al tema lo plantearon ustedes, no lo plantearon ningún medio, ningún medio, pero no preguntaré eso porque, sellamente, nadie lo conocía. Sí, sí, pero el título de realidad también llama cierta confusión en la forma que se pone, porque cuando uno lee la nota tampoco el doctor de la oposición se habló de un sellado que faltaba y lo único que falta un sellado de 485 pesos faltan sellados y faltan algunos otros trámites también que son parte de son burocráticos los trámites en realidad pero lo que quiero decir que bueno a día de hoy la visitación está en diciembre del 2010 cuando nosotros lo asumimos no estaba lista y hoy tampoco está y estamos gestionando en forma de lo más pronto posible terminarla que cuando esté la habilitación terminada les vamos a avisar. ¿Y ahora de qué depende esto? Ahora está dependiendo de nosotros que terminemos de hacer todas las gestiones que falta. Hay alguna vale de región sanitaria de acuerdo a las últimas inspecciones porque o sea uno supone que el hospital se está habilitado no puede funcionar el hospital público. El hospital sigue funcionando la habilitación es una habilitación de tipo sanitaria, el hospital se va a clausurar y nunca va a dejar de atender Lo que sí, una falta de habilitación nos pone en algún tipo de riesgo legal, eso sí. Igualmente esto no tuvo que ver con el traspaso, precisamente del cual la se mencionó, porque justo estaban terminando esos trámites y si el internet es aliente, digamos, bueno, no se terminó en su momento, pero lo tenía que hacer justamente si ingresaban. No, los trámites se vienen reclamando desde el Ministerio de Región Sanitaria, desde el año 2009, en donde por cuestiones de ampliación nos hicieron en el 2010, se hizo un pedido de ampliación, Nosotros en ningún momento hablamos de deficiencia administrativa, simplemente la conferencia de presa anterior intentamos hacer un resumen de lo actuado durante los 60 días entre los que mencionamos bueno este tema de la falta de habilitación que los que nos estaba entorpeciendo el progreso a algunas cosas. Pero esos son temas absolutamente administrativos, no tiene que ver con la cuestión médica del manejo de hospitales. administrativo. Esto es un tema puramente administrativo. Por eso dije al principio de esta conferencia de que son temas que evidentemente no hacen a la gente y creo que a la gente le interesa demasiado este tema. Creo que la gente está esperando otra cosa tanto de nosotros en la dirección o secretaría del hospital como de la oposición en este caso. Así que creemos que, vuelvo a decir, creo que se ha exagerado la cosa en ningún momento no se faltó el respeto ni se consideró ni se consideraron cuestiones ilegales ni más yo me estuve de decir ustedes me preguntaron cuáles eran las razones por las cuales no se habían hecho los trámites que yo no soy ni quien para jugarlo ni para decirlo así que este creo que con esto podemos dar por cerrado este episodio ¿Evidentemente le falta de habilitación del hospital? en este momento. Lo que nosotros sí sabemos y decimos que la falta de habilitación a nosotros, por ejemplo, en cierto modo nos va a impedir hacer contratos con los brazos sociales, nos va a impedir habilitarlo de equipos y eso hace a la falta de trabajo del hospital y es finalmente redonda la estadística y en la coparticipación, ni más ni menos. Ustedes la semana pasada dijo que había bajado la coparticipación porque no estaba la habilitación. Eso había bajado. Puede ser una de las causas por las cuales la coparticipación sí se había dimitido. ¿Cuándo habla de trámites burocráticos? ¿De parte de quiénes? Acá o desde dónde? de la región sanitaria el hacer la inspección de obra una vez finalizada y que ahí se iniciaron los trámites, eso es lo que él dice. Nosotros tuvimos con región sanitaria y precisamente estamos hablando de este tema porque de región sanitaria se nos dijo que se habían solicitado los trámites en varias ocasiones y que no se habían cumplimentado y que recién en el último tiempo se lograron poner en marcha algunas cosas.","Good morning to all, thank you very much for the presence, I call you a little today because I see myself in a certain way in the obligation to clarify some things, before the answer that we have received, a little radical, before the declarations that we made last week. Actually, I want to be very short and very short because I think that these things They don't build and I think people are waiting for something else from the health area and we are in this type of discussions. I want to say that today the hospital doesn't have the permit. It can be said whatever it says because the permit is not there. They say they can refute our declarations. As I said, the date doesn't have the permit and since 2009 it is claiming the same thing and although some management have been done, management is not finished. As for the equipment, as for what is called State policy, we are exercising the State policy in this case, giving continuity to the equipment that previous management used inside the hospital and we have the obligation to put them on the go. We are not administrators, we are not the owners of the teams, nor the owners of the things. So I just wanted to clarify these things. I think that a little overacted with the subject of repudiation and that kind of stories. I just want to say that I think people are waiting for something else, both in our management and in the opposition. So with this I intend to give a term. of the hospital structure in 2010 and they were in that and they were made to pass instructions by part of the previous direction but hey, they did not end up so today the habilitation is not when they do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do that we, with these declarations, confused the population. And in reality, at no time did we say that due to the lack of habilitation the hospital stopped attending to the public, nor that it was closed. At no time did we say that kind of thing. But that is what they mention, and a little bit, I also think that the title of the weekly refreshment that says, denounces the lack of habilitation of the hospital, in reality it was not a denunciation, it was a press conference where Among other things, he talked about the visit. You talked about a house-to-house trap, when you made a case of the case. Yes, but to make a complaint, we have not made any complaint, no institution, no health care. Nobody should be reported. I have a comment. It was not the legal requirement, the subject was not yours, nor the media. Nobody came to ask that because nobody knew it. Yes, but the title of reality also causes confusion in the way it is put, because when you read the note, The doctor said that the position was made of a seal, which is missing and the only thing missing is a seal of 485 pesos. There are no seals and some other entrances are also missing. They are bureaucratic entrances, in reality. But what I mean is that today the visitation is... In December 2010, when we took over, it was not ready. Today it is not ready either. managing the most soon possible to finish it. When the habilitation is finished, we will notify them. And now what depends on this? Now it depends on us that we finish doing all the necessary management. Is there any health care in accordance with the latest inspections? Because some are supposed to be able to work in a public hospital. The hospital continues to work. The habilitation is a type of health care. The hospital will never close and will never stop attending. What if a lack of skills puts us in some kind of legal risk? That's right. It was also not necessary to see with the passage precisely of which I mentioned it, because it was just finishing those trimmings and if the internet was good, let's say, well, it was not finished at the time, but it had to be done precisely if it entered. No, the trimmings are coming, claiming from the Ministry of the United States of the Year 2009, where in terms of inflation they did us in 2010, a request for an increase was made, We have not talked about administrative deficiency at all. We have only talked about the previous press conference. We tried to make a summary of what we have been doing for the past 60 days. Among those who mention this issue of lack of rehabilitation, those who were disrupting us, progress, some things. But those are absolutely administrative issues. You do not have to deal with the medical issue of the hospital management. This is a purely administrative issue. That's why I said at the beginning of this conference that they are issues that obviously do not make people and I think people are interested in this issue. I think people are waiting for something else, both in the direction of the hospital secretary and in the opposition in this case. So I think I will say again that the thing has been exaggerated. I did not have respect, nor did I consider myself to be illegal, nor did I have the right to say what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what We are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take part in this, we are not in a position to take We know and say that the lack of rehabilitation will prevent us from doing contracts with social workers, prevent us from being able to do the team rehabilitation. That is due to the lack of hospital work and the statistics and the participation. You said last week that there was no participation because there was no rehabilitation. That can be one of the causes of the participation. When you talk about bureaucratic transmissions, who are you from? From where? And now the transmissions are missing. From here to complete the transmissions from the other side. Sorry, the health region was so much of this, because I read in the reflexes that Dr. Pison said that the papers had been presented, that the health region had indicated that they expect the funding of the work. Pison said that the responsibility was in knowledge and that they called them, they were knowing that they came, they combined between the previous direction of the hospital the Sanitary Region, the inspection of work once completed and that there were no procedures. That's what he said. Yes, we had the Sanitary Region and we are talking about this issue because the Sanitary Region told us that they had requested the procedures on several occasions and that they had not been fulfilled and that they had recently managed to set up some things in advance."

And it will never end, it's a new light in my heart. And our life will always be yours. Who doesn't like it, it's no longer our problem. I'm the one who can tell you that I love you. That's why you're my sweet angel. Who is coming from heaven, a time of not being happy. It's easy to get through the fights, before you, it was a name. You don't even know the minus. Now you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you In my life, you are the most important thing here. Our love grows where there is no sound at all. It's your fault, it's your fault. Everyone has found their way out. It depends on it. It can be shorter than me or all the other dreams. Everyone can be so short-tempered as a very long-time. You are a small girl who is so hard to cross. I'm not even that kind of girl who's been worse than me. I'm just a chebysuit, I'm not a cheater, I don't know what to do. But if you're the one for me, you're the one who's the funniest. Give me your hand, to my right subject, together. And I'd like everyone to understand that we're not together. In my life, you're the worst shit, the worst thing in my life. Our love grew where it never was."

Utilizaremos harina, usaremos mantequilla, una yema de huevo, azúcar glass, nata para cocinar la lecheira y las bañaremos en chocolate en eslepos 3. Primero de todo, pongo la harina en un bol de un poquito de hueco para hacer con forma de volcán, añadida la yema la mantequilla que está a temperatura ambiente. La he sacado de la nevera, un par de horitas antes y el azúcar glas. Vamos a añadir un par de cucharaditas de nata para suavizar un poco las galletas. Lo voy a mezclar un poco con la cuchara, pero las masas de galletas sean de amasar con las manos. Las trabajamos hasta incorporar bien todos los ingredientes. Tengo la masa lista, no hay que trabajarla mucho este tipo de masa. Para ello trabaja encima del marbol de la mesa. Ponemos un poco de harina y así nos pegará. Tenéis que procurar que el grosor sea similar en todos los lados para que las galletas, a la hora de cocerlas, necesiten el mismo tiempo de cocción de horneado. Tenemos la masa lista y de coger unos moldes. Voy recortando las galletas. Las galletas y las pongo sobre una bandeja de horno con papel vegetal, incluso pequeñines. Con los recortes hacemos una bola, la volvemos a estirar. Y así hasta tener la masa terminada. Están las galletas listas para hornear. En este caso veis que no las he pintado con huevo porque las bañaremos con chocolate. Si no lo sé, si eres con chocolate podéis con un poco de yema de huevo y un pincel las pintáis. Las vamos a hornear durante unos 20 minutos aproximadamente a 180 grados. Poner las galletas vamos fundiendo el chocolate. Vamos a utilizar 100 gramos, utilizaremos 4 barritas, las ponemos en este recipiente y a microondas, un minuto a 700 vatios. Bien, tengo las galletas listas, el chocolate fundido y ahora voy a bañarlas. Las cojo, las introduzco y las pongo unas rejillas hasta que el chocolate se solidifique. A gusto con la vida es disfrutar de pequeños momentos con las personas que quieres.","Hello! Using the help of Saint Valentin I'm going to show you how to prepare some cookies in the shape of a heart, bathed in chocolate. We will use flour, butter, an egg yolk, icing sugar, cream to cook the milk and we will bath them in chocolate in a slipper. First of all I put the flour in a bowl, add a little bit of egg and to make a volcano shape add the egg yolk Add the butter and the sugar. Add a few tablespoons of cream to soften the cookies. Mix well. We will add the dough to the pan and we will spread it. Place the cookies on a baking tray with vegetable paper. Even small ones. With the cutters we make a ball and we stretch it again. This is how you have the finished dough. The cookies are ready to bake. In this case you can see that I did not paint them with egg because we will bathe them with chocolate. If you do not want to use chocolate you can use a little egg yolk and a brush. You can paint them. We will bake them for about 20 minutes at 180 degrees. We're going to melt the chocolate. We're going to use 100 gr. We'll use 4 bars. We'll put them in this container and microwave them for 1 minute at 700 watts. Well, the chocolate is melted and I'm going to bathe them. I take them out, I put them in the fridge and I put them in a rack until the chocolate solidifies. I like to enjoy life with the people I love."

Well, O&R's science advisor Don Murakami at Camp Smith Marine Base in Hawaii has been testing a system that does just that. It's called the Micro-Auto Gasification System or MAGS. The MAGS reduces solid waste by as much as 95%. Because the waste is not incinerated, it dramatically reduces the carbon dioxide produced by the processing. Additionally, gases created by the process can be used to help keep the system running, making it very environmentally friendly and fuel efficient. An integral part of the MAG's testing process is constantly checking wastewater to be sure it complies with EPA standards. coming out of the smokestack because we want to make sure it's safe for the environment and safe for our Marines. We're taking technology that was originally designed for shipward use and applying it for the forward operating base. The Department of the Navy will by 2020 produce at least half our shore based energy requirements on our installations from alternative sources. The MAG's program is just one of many O&R programs that is advancing the Secretary of the Navy's energy goals. The Secretary is very driven and very forward thinking in terms of moving the Department of the Navy towards alternative energy sources. In order to gather input on the feasibility of using MAGs for forward operating bases, the Marines evaluated MAGs during a recent test. We had eight Marines on loan and they operated MAGs for two weeks straight. And that was really the main test, is to put it in front of the Marines and see what they thought and get their Using mags, a large bag of garbage can be reduced to an ash-like residual filling, less than half a baby food jar. As you start combusting the waste, it produces what we call a syn gas, which is a carbon monoxide-hydrogen mixture. And that in itself is a combustible gas, and it basically takes that gas and recycles it into the combustion process. Waste disposal in the field is a huge problem. It has the space requirement, it has the health requirements that everybody has. Additionally, we have a have a security requirement. And that anything that we throw away, we have to make sure it can't be used back against us or that nobody gets hurt scavenging through it. The way we work in a forward operating base in places like Iraq or Afghanistan, something like MAGs could be hugely beneficial to their day-to-day operations and really in the end, increase their combat capability in the field. This new process could also benefit many outside of the military. A lot of things we do in the military can have huge benefits for things in the For example, what we're looking at at Ford Operating Bases could easily be applied to a school, a hospital, an office building, disposing of our waste in a different manner than just sending it to the landfill. Really it is because of O&R that we have this project here and we have made progress in this area. I think the best thing about MAGS is that it's brand new technology but widely applicable. It hits on things like the environment and sustainability and it's really opened people's eyes into how we could attack this problem differently. Really the heart of the technology for MAGS is gasification. And the new thing with MAGS is that we're able to do it on a much smaller scale than it has occurred in the past. So really it's about miniaturizing that technology and making it small enough that we could even think about deploying it into the field. We wanted this to work if it falls off a truck. It needs to be carried by a helicopter. It needs to be portable. It needs to be effective. It needs to be simple. It needs to be durable. One MAGS unit, one day, may handle the daily waste stream for one day. and so if we have a solution that can reduce the security concerns of trash disposal and additionally help the environmental concerns, that's a good thing for the marine corps. Well the beauty of mags is that we're using our trash as a source of fuel. So even though we use electricity to power mags, the energy output of mags is more than what we put into it. And so there's an opportunity to use that heat that comes out of it to do something productive with. to include education in this. In fact, I've recently announced programs that we're looking at starting this coming year, Asia Pacific Technology and Education Program, where it's looking at how you can combine the technologies, the educational aspects with the universities, but very importantly with the commercial sector and how all those partners can come together to help move us forward into alternative energies to meet the Secretary's goals, but also to address the national needs and in fact transport those eventually to the world in itself. you","Imagine a system that takes 100 pounds of trash and turns it into 5 pounds of harmless ash and creates more energy than it uses.

In order to gather input on the feasibility of using MAGs for forward operating bases, the Marines evaluated MAGs during a recent test. We had eight Marines on loan and they operated MAGs for two weeks straight. And that was really the main test, is to put it in front of the Marines and see what they thought and get their Using mags, a large bag of garbage can be reduced to an ash-like residual filling, less than half a baby food jar. As you start combusting the waste, it produces what we call a syn gas, which is a carbon monoxide-hydrogen mixture. And that in itself is a combustible gas, and it basically takes that gas and recycles it into the combustion process. Waste disposal in the field is a huge problem. It has the space requirement, it has the health requirements that everybody has. Additionally, we have a have a security requirement. And that anything that we throw away, we have to make sure it can't be used back against us or that nobody gets hurt scavenging through it. The way we work in a forward operating base in places like Iraq or Afghanistan, something like MAGS could be hugely beneficial to their day-to-day operations and really in the end increase their combat capability in the field. This new process could also benefit many outside of the military. A lot of things we do in the military can have huge benefits for things in the For example, what we're looking at at Ford operating bases could easily be applied to a school, a hospital, an office building, disposing of our waste in a different manner than just sending it to the landfill. Really it is because of O&R that we have this project here and we have made progress in this area. I think the best thing about MAGS is that it's brand new technology but widely applicable. It hits on things like the environment and sustainability and it's really opened people's eyes into how we could attack this problem differently. Really the heart of the technology for MAGS is gasification. And the new thing with MAGS is that we're able to do it on a much smaller scale than it has occurred in the past. So really it's about miniaturizing that technology and making it small enough that we could even think about deploying it into the field. We wanted this to work if it falls off a truck. It needs to be carried by a helicopter. It needs to be portable. It needs to be effective. It needs to be simple. It needs to be durable. One MAGS unit, one day, may handle the daily waste stream for one day. So if we have a solution that can reduce the security concerns of trash disposal and additionally help the environmental concerns, that's a good thing for the marine corps. Well the beauty of mags is that we're using our trash as a source of fuel. So even though we use electricity to power mags, the energy output of mags is more than what we put into it. And so there's an opportunity to use that heat that comes out of it to do something productive with. to include education in this. In fact, I've recently announced programs that we're looking at starting this coming year, Asia Pacific Technology and Education Program, where it's looking at how you can combine the technologies, the educational aspects with the universities, but very importantly with the commercial sector, and how all those partners can come together to help move us forward into alternative energies to meet the Secretary's goals, but also to address the national needs, and in fact, transport those eventually to the world in itself. you"

Вот, Александр, первое, что хочу сказать, я не хочу, чтобы расценили, что я как-то вам что-то пытаюсь показать, но я считаю, чтобы по-моему говорить о системе, кто бы и что ни говорил, объективно и не объективно, чутки не нужно работать. Я к чему веду, у нас две плиты разные, 18 и 19 миллиметров, это тоже сознательно сделано давайте посмотрим что это даст пристыки на ряд шкантов у меня проходная восьмерки, поскольку другие восьмерки у меня угроблены поэтому я могу пробивать но сейчас для этого эксперимента это не имеет значения многого пробивая у нас по себе нет материала ряд есть теперь собственно то что у нас будет на стыке теперь оно должно быть вот так вот Возьмите, что я вам даю. Струшки достаточно количество, мне так кажется. Продолжим. Я еще раз повторюсь, видео это сняты не для того, чтобы вам что-то доказать. Я считаю, что ассистемт иногда не заслужен на критику. Понимаете? Я, например, умел сколько привык. Вот, что я не задумывался о том, что я делаю. и делаю это всегда на скоростях. Я сейчас тут это видео как бы не буду, да переснимаю там как-то ритушировать вот как она идет так и показываю потому что у меня сегодня в одно место должен поехать и у меня нет времени на красоты вот как выйдет так вы его и собственно увидите. У меня вот тут из-за стружки расслоения Свои немедлили. Надо было стружку отводить еще на 40 шкантов. Здесь не будет 40, но какое-то количество будет. Видите, немножко треснула плита, но ничего страшного. Я не хочу, чтобы воспринимали это как некую попытку оправдаться. По-моему, так все должно происходить. Все-таки, наверное, не предназначен для такого ряда, но тем не менее. Я не знаю, видно, видно не доходят до конца где-то и не досверлил обратный конец ведь у меня треснул DSP но тем не менее может быть это не очень красивый эксперимент но я хочу сказать что это не те полтора два миллиметра о которых идет речь вот здесь вот здесь даже пальцами не чувствуется здесь чуть-чуть уходит за счет того что раскалывала плиту не знаю видно или нет потому что я не отвел стружку. В общем-то, прошу понять мои действия правильно. Инструмент все равно любой требует определенного опыта. Это как бы мое личное и твердое убеждение. Спасибо за внимание.","Hello, collars against the Festool-Ephere and in general X, specially for Alexander Vins. Alexander, first, what I want to say, I do not want to be appreciated, I think that I try to show something to you, but I think that to speak about the system, who would not speak objectively and not objectively, you need not work. I see two plates, 18 and 19 millimeters. let's see what it will give when sticking a row of clamps I have a pass 8, since the other 8 are chopped, so I can break through, but now for this experiment it does not matter, breaking through the wall is not materialized, there is a row, now the fact that we will have a cut, now it should be like this, I will Alexander, it is very important that the base side is not confused. Perhaps it does not give you the opportunity to work fully. Here we will also see the further gaps, as we see too many chips. Even the raw material does not completely come out. Well, look, the plant does not stand inside. I just imagine what the picture will be. If it is all, if I go to the water with all the wishes, make minimal gaps and everything is completely covered with a shank. The shank is enough, I think so. I repeat again, the video is not filmed for you to prove something, I just think that the system is sometimes not deserved to be criticized. I, for example, have a lot of habits, that I do not think about what I am doing, I will do it at high speeds. I will not shoot this video, I will retouch it. I will show how it goes. I have no time for beauty. I think it should be like this. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it.

I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can I did not take off the string. I ask you to understand my actions correctly. Instruments are still any demand of certain experience. This is my personal and firm belief. Thank you for your attention."

We will use two sliders. The Double Mountain Climber breaststroke is in the same way as the one in the upper body. The third is to draw the breath and the nose. Now, put the slider on the left side and push it to the right side. The head and the shoulder are straight. The hand width is easy to reach the shoulder width. First, put the slider straight from here and draw the line when you return. This time, draw the line on the opposite side and pull the elbow and put the knee down. Then, put the slider straight from here. Draw the knee and bring it closer to the chest. Then, draw the knee and bring it back. Straighten the knee and draw the knee and bring it back. Draw the knee and bring it back. Draw the knee and bring it back. That's all for the double mountain climber breast stroke."

Ok, leaving aside the horrible pain I'm feeling right now, let's go with the video, it hurts. Every time we've gone through a scare, it's a small scare like, did you study for the test? What test? The coefficient of two mathematics? A scare a little bigger. Another thing that scares me is this. I'm going to the country! Ok, but hurry up! Another scare that we all go through when we're little is when your mom or dad goes to your power meeting. Just that meeting where they give the notes. And you stay in the house suffering, looking at the door as an idiot for hours until finally... Hi, daddy! I come from your power meeting. No, don't tell me! I mean, how did you go, daddy? What do you think? Are you going to give me a belt for the good notes? No? Daddy, no! Please, no, daddy! No, no, daddy! No, no, daddy! And you spend all the waiting time torturing yourself with your own thoughts. He's going to get married. His mom came to live with us. The dog died. He's pregnant. He burned the house. He discovered that I'm Batman. And he continues, he continues, he continues. Another thing that scares me is... I said like 10 pesos in this video. Another thing that scares me is this. Sorry, I bother you, can you tell me the time? There's no problem. Where's my cell phone? My cell phone? I had it here? My cell phone? It's like... And there comes something that I call... Where the fuck is my cell phone dance? Where are you? My cell phone If there is something more terrible than touching your pocket and not finding your cell phone It is to find it But to see that you have 50 lost calls from your mother That is never good Another thing that is scary, only scary games Don't tell me Although in these times it is difficult to find a horror game that is scary In my time horror games were better They sound like old people In my times Well, despite that One can still find one or another game out there Hey, there is a game that is scary that is fashionable I'm already big, don't scare me with games. Ah, play it, it's called Slender. Pff, the name. Play it, I bet you're scared. I'm going to play it. Ah, see how terrible the game is. Ok, so I have to find notes or something like that? The little girls don't worth these games. Two seconds later. Never again, never again. Ask! What was the last scare you went through? I, the one who didn't find the cell phone.

Backstage I was shocked but with the energy of the kids I was here, the whole community. I was strong and I tried to give the best. I was happy. In one year I was changing so much to the best. I ask Maria, maybe she is more artistic. You have a way to perform a song by Jennifer Brown, which you have been looking forward to. When they gave me the second part of the live, I was a bit confused at first, because it was difficult. I want this song to be heard by Maria, to be so good that we can talk about it later. Maria, a good performance in the Eurovision. Let's hear it for him. When I saw that Catherine and Matisse had chosen this piece, I remembered what they said to me... when I chose the song of Marinella because of the little Ioanna. Because you said that this song was so close to you. You were so close. You are amazing. Bravo! Bravo, Katerina! It was great. What happened? Did you make a joke? We didn't make a joke, but we ran away. When you reached the microphone, we ran away. I wanted to tell you something, I said it in the video. The entire artist I have seen on the stage, the X Factor, is so famous. It's the most important thing in the work. It has a specific purpose, it's a common goal. Many people asked about it. I heard a song that I didn't want to sing. I think the three of us agreed. It was a great song. You know very well that it's a song that changes the look. It has a goal and a purpose. You'll get it soon, and you'll imagine it much faster. Why didn't you want to sing it? I didn't know that. Why? I didn't know that. I'm so happy that you were a little old and I didn't like it. I didn't hear it. You said it was a great experience. Thank you. Maria, you did well. Maria, you showed us that you can do it and that you need some help. And many other things. I'm telling you, this moment is in your mind. Maria, we'll talk about it later."

Mi sono stato in New York, in New York, a promoting Chuck. e che era una canzone che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è molto carica e che è e in questo modo, non è una cosa che si fa in un studio di ricordi e fa qualcosa professionale. Ma il fatto di fare le cose in questo modo è una cosa che io faccio in mezzo tempo. Non so come è stato in Italia o in altre parti dell'Europa, ma in i Stati, ci sono molti attori che hanno provato a cantare, anche se sono due buoni, le persone si sono progettate. In America, si chiede che si sia che ci sia che ci sia, Per me è un po' triste perché un po' di singoli possono essere i attori e tutti sono ok con lui, anche se non sono molto buoni. Ma se un attore che ha un buon poveri vuole essere un singolo, tutti siano un attore, non si trattano di singoli. Quindi, io sto solo provando a sapere se le persone piacerebbero e se i fan dicono che vogliamo entendere più, non so, magari faremo più, ma questo era un po' più... Per Catherine, perché aveva voglia di fare qualcosa di così e pensavo che sarebbe buono. Mi credo che si tratta bene. Ti piaceva? Sì. Sì. Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? Sì? per fare delle promozioni per Chuck, l'ho incontrata e un nostro amico stava parlando della riregistrazione della canzone Terry Fild e aveva anche detto che io avrei accattato il suo matrimonio perché è una cosa che mi piace fare per i miei cimi di Berthe poi ho lavorato in diversi musicali. Così il catrinale è zaccanto, non lo sapevo e io avevo il mio sogno era andare inoscure di registrazione perché certo io sono un attore ma da maggior parte delle volte succede che per gli attori che vanno in voce di me traprende una carriera da cantanti e ci sono molte critiche che dicono che diventano cantanti di bassa categoria, di bassa lega, mentre invece se un cantante passa a cinema non c'è problema, non è nessuna litritica. Allora ho provato a cantare e se si saranno seguito, se vi piace, ma e soprattutto se chiede un lavoro, potremmo anche lavorare da altre con la colazione. Ok, vi ho finito.","We have two problems. One is to hear the answer and two is that the time is too short. We can't be here until tonight. Among other things, at 3 p.m. today, in the afternoon, there will be another meeting with the audience. I ask all of them to ask a few questions, to wait only an hour and a half and they will have the opportunity to talk about the other room. and she was promoting her new album and I was in New York promoting Chuck at the same time and we saw each other and our mutual friend was then talking to her and her management and all that and they were talking about how they were thinking about re-recording, terrified that song that the song terrified and and he happened to say oh yeah zaksing I sing at his wedding Just for fun just saying as wedding and I grew up doing a lot of musical theater and things like that So then Catherine and her people were like oh zaksing we didn't know that and we talked and you know emailed and And just you know they said well we'd love for you to re-record the duet and I said well that seems like fun right yeah, I've always wanted to I think it's important to go to a recording studio and do something professionally like that. But acting is what I do most of the time. And I don't know what it's like in Italy or other parts of Europe, but in the States, a lot of actors who try to sing, even if they're good singers, people reject it. They think in America we call it cheesy. I don't know what the dialogue would be. I think it's sad because a lot of singers can go and be actors and everybody's okay with it. Even if I'm not that good. But if an actor who has a good voice wants to go and be a singer, everyone goes, oh no, they're an actor. They don't do singing. So I'm just trying it out and if people like it, then cool. And if fans say, hey, we want to hear more, then I don't know, maybe I'll do more. But that was more just... For Catherine, because she wanted to do something like that and I thought it would be fun. And I think it turned out pretty good. Did you like it? Yes. Yes. Congratulations? Yes. No? No? You don't like my friend Ricardo? I was preparing the promotions for Chuck, I met him and our friend was talking about the re-recording of the song called The Re-File and he also said that I had sung it on a wedding because it's something I like to do for fun, then I worked in musical universities. So Catherine said, Zacca, I didn't know, and my dream was to go to Moscow for a re-recording because I'm an actor, but most of the time it happens that for the actors who are going to take a career from singers, there are critical motifs that say that they will become singers of low category, of low leg. Whereas if a singer passes to cinema there is no problem, no one is critical. So I started singing, I tried to sing and if I do I agree if I follow, if you like, but above all if you want to work, you will also work with others with the collaboration. Ok, we are done. Thank you very much!"

The most important basics is shampoo and conditioning. That's where you get your hair started in that perfect sense of balance. Then from there you can do all the other stuff such as styling and different techniques. We're going to be showing you with braids and perm rods and simple things like that. shampoo Which is wrong I recommend every other day Sometimes people go a couple days, which is no problem if you knew how long hairdressers went then you'd probably freak out Yeah, right seven days later, so basically you want to start with a good shampoo There are a lot of shampoos on the market You want to find one that is specific for your hair type first of all Do you have colored hair? Do you have normal hair things like that? Okay? What's What signs are your hair showing as far as does it soak up product? Does when you get your hair colored does it take more product of color to applicate to your head? You know, things like that. You're going to notice a big difference. You want to find out, you know, and you have curly hair, straight hair. There are a lot of things on the market that will help increase the potential of your hair. Needless to say, if it doesn't have the potential as it is. Okay, let's say colored hair. Colored hair. hair. You want to avoid sulfates. You want to avoid big volume shampoos. In most cases there are some sexy hair has a big sexy big volume shampoo which is color safe. It's not color protected but it's color safe. In most cases store bought shampoos you're going to buy a big shampoo that makes your hair big. What you're actually doing is expanding the cuticle of your hair which in most cases you're opening that cuticle up for your color to leave. So, you know, you want to be kind of generous on, you know, as far as how much you use if you do want to do a big volume shampoo. You're going to find, you know, less is more at first. And if you need more, feel free to add more. And then as far as application, what do you suggest? I think you have to let me know. Exactly. You know, it's like usually in most cases I hear from all my clients, it's like the first thing that they do, put it in their hands, rub it a couple of times and then glop it on top. Wrong people. Wrong. You know you want to start with the ends first in most cases ends are what sees the most damage second to the top of your head This is where sun hits. This is where you play with your hair This is where the most attention is received So therefore you want to take your time to get there you want to start with the ends first and work towards the root area Okay, so I put it in bomb correct do your ends mid shaft and then Dolls are here. Yes a little bit more in my hands if you need to if you need to I'm thinking about quarter size should do anyone just fine Especially with your texture of hair fine texture yet. You have a lot of it also Extensions come into play for you too. So, you know, that's another thing you need to look at, you know, how much Shampoo do you want to put on your extensions? Not too much. Yeah, I don't think not too much, you know in most cases, you know, they're already in a sense, you know most most color is Carpet dye that's how most extensions are colored to get that color that continually stays that color right so I mean in a sense they're already damaged more than your hair But you can have nice nice extensions with nice shampoo, okay? So you know less is more in that sense quarter size should be good for anyone now that I go for conditioner as well correct go ahead and go up top You don't look at this around on the roots right you know and it's like it's like you want to you want to take care of all of your hair That's how it is you know conditioning, however, the difference between that and shampooing, condition every day. You know, every day that you get your hair wet, feel free to condition. Is that shampooing that is correct? You want to find it once again, though, you know, you have your different types of conditioners, big volume, sleek, sexy, curly, you know, find one that's going to be suitable for your hair, you know, in your case, you know, fine texture. You have a lot of it, but still fine texture. So you can get your hair wet, you know, So you want to find a finer conditioner that is not going to weigh your hair down. Okay. That's the biggest thing. Alright, so we're going to be back with another video on talking about the correct shampoo products and conditioning products, correct? Correct. Alright, so this is Ask the Hotty and check out the other videos with Brandon Arthur.","I'm going to start off with the basics. The most important basics is shampoo and conditioning.

No es fácil. ¡Que no!","Hello, this is a exclusive video for muyperraz.com This is a video about the ass of the day You are about to ask me for a fucking shit, but tell me what you are going to say, but I'm going to be a dead man This is my imaginary and the one who is going to be my ass I say, the collagado The truth is that this right now seems to me like a dick. And here another genius. Observe again how it comes from behind, that the game of the gods is played. This trajectory is the game that only the chosen ones do. Perfect. It's not easy."

Δυνάμες να επιδημήσουμε ότι είναι ομαδοποιημένη όμι η πολλαπλασιασμή. Βάζουμε ένα παράδειγμα για να μελετήσουμε τις ιδιότητες των δυνάμεων. Άς υποθέσουμε ότι έχουμε να υπολογήσουμε το γινόμενο του 2 στην 3η και του 2 στην 5η. Δηλαδή πολλαπλασιάζουμε το 2 στην 3η με το 2 στην 5η. Έντα αυτρόπες να το υπολογήσουμε αυτό είναι να δύο πιδίο πιδίο πιδίο Από το διεύτερο πρόσφαλε να βρουμε ένα τρόπο να υπολογήσουμε ή να γράψουμε το γινόμενο του διεύτερος τρίτη επειδή οπιδείο στην πέμπτη. 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, Εντάξει το δύο στις εξορρισμού, δηλαδή, αν δείτε τους εκθέτες 5 και 3 κάνει 8 αφού το δύο στην 3η είναι πολλαπλασιασμός του 2 με τον 9 αυτού τρεις φορές και το δύο στην 5η είναι πολλαπλασιασμός του 2 με τον 9 αυτό του 5 φορές και μεταξύ τους σημειώνεται πολλαπλασιασμός, ετώ τότε το δύο πολλαπλασιάζεται με τον 9 αυτό του 8 φορές.

Αλλά αν είναι ίδια αυτά τα οποία προσθήθηκε, δελτά να δούμε έχουμε το 2 στην 8 το οποίο προσθήθηκε με 2 στην 8. Αυτό σημαίνει ότι έχω 2 από αυτά τα 2 στην 8. Σκεφτείτε ότι ήταν ένας αρθμός α και α που μας κάνει 2α. Άρα είναι 2 επει 2 στην 8. Τα οποία λοιπόν πολλοπασιάζεται 2 επει 2 στην 8. Δεν μπορώ να πλασιάζεται το 2 στην 8η με το 2 στην 8η. Προσοχή. Προστοίθεται. Τώρα το 2 μπορώ να το γράψω 2 στην πρώτη. Και το 2 στην 8η θα το αφήσω 2 στην 8η. Απαλή εφαρρένθεση γιατί δεν χρειάζεται αφού σημείνον την πλασιάστηση του πλοπλασιασμού. Τώρα 2 στην πρώτη, επειδή 2 στην 8η μας κάνει 2 στην ενάπτη. Όπως είδαμε με την ιδιότητα παραπάνω. Τώρα αυτό ήταν ένα πολύ ειδικό παράδειγμα. Το επόμενο παράδειγμα είναι και πάλι για πλασιασμό. Πλασιασμό με δυνάμεις ίδια Δεν θα το ζυβήσω αυτό το τρίο, δεν συγνωμηθώ, θα το κάνουμε πέντε. Δεν ξέρω σκηφτό μου να είμαι και το κανατρίο.

Μπορείτε να το ελέγξετε. Τώρα το ίδιο το πέντε στον τετράγωνο μπορούμε να το υπολογήσουμε, μπορώ να το γράψουμε 25. Θα συνεχίσουμε κάθε εκ δύο δυνάμεων με η διαβάση, ας που έχουμε το δύο στην ενάτι το οποίο θέλουμε να το διερέσουμε με το δύο στη δεκάτι αυτό για να βρούμε την ιδιότητα ουσιαστικά και να την καταλάβουμε μπορούμε να το γράψουμε με ένα διαφορετικό τρόπο να πούμε ότι αυτό το πιλίκου είναι δύο στην ενάτι επί 1 δια 2 στη δεκάτι σκεφτείτε ότι γίνεται το πολλοπλασιασμός δύο στην ενάτι πένα δύο στην ενάτι είναι το ίδιο τώρα το δύο στην ενάτι είναι δύο στην ενάτι αλλά το 1 δια 2 στη δεκάτι είναι δύο στην μύον 10 Από τον ορισμό, αν δεν τον θυμάστε, μπορείτε να ανατρέξετε σε κάποιο βιβλίο.

Δηλαδή εδώ προσθέτουμε τις εκθέτες 9 και 1, 10 κάνει 1, 1. Άρα αυτό είναι 2 στην 1, δηλαδή 1, 2 στην 1, ή αλλιώς 1, 2. Οπότε τι μπορούμε να δούμε, μπορούμε να δούμε ότι αν διερούμε δύο δυνάμεις με την ίδια ορθή.

Είναι πιο πιστικό. Διαβάση και θα είναι το άθρωσμα των διεξετών διεξετών, διεξετών την 209. Με αυτό το τελευταίο παράδειγμα, ίσως, περδευτήκατε λίγο, αλλά αν δείτε ένα βίντεο ή διαβάσετε τις ιδιότητες των δυνάμενων από κάποιο βιβλίο, νομίζω ότι όλα θα ξεκαθαρίσουν το κεφάλι σας να περνάτε πάρα πάρα πολύ όμορφα.","In this video we will do many examples of the properties of the forces. Let's consider that the mass of the two is the third and the mass of the two is the fifth. We assume that the 2 in the third is 2x2x2 which makes us 8. The 2 in the fifth is maybe 32. So the 3rd and 5th is exactly the same as the 8th with the 32 which makes us 256. You can also guess a value and assume it as 2x8x16, 3x8x3, 8x4 and 9x25. We can use it only if we have small numbers. We can easily use the 2, 3 and 2, 5. But if we had the 7, 5 and 7, 3, 5, it would be much more difficult. So, we can find another way to use it or write the common 2, 3, 5, 2, 5. Let's see what the 2, 3, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2, The second is the 8th. If you look at the 6th, 5th and 3rd, it is 8th. Since the 3rd is the 2nd with the 9th 3 times and the 2nd with the 5th 5 times, the 2nd with the 9th 5 times and the 6th with the 9th 5 times, the 2nd with the 9th 5 times and the 6th with the 9th 5 times, the 2nd with the 9th 5 times and the 6th with the 9th 5 times. Let's see another example. Let's write the 7th in the 2nd. 7 to the left is 7 to the left and 7 to the left is 7 to the left. Now we don't put any assumptions because we know that it means that the alplacias are not in the same order. So there is no superiority of one side of the alplacias. And since everything is 7 to the left, we have 6 to the left, or else we add the 6th. 4 and 2 make us 6. This is only for the power generated. Now we have to write 107 which is 50. If we add 2 powers to the 2 powers, we can't do it. We can't add them to the 5th power. We can't add them to the 5th power. We can write it with a smaller number and see that it's something different. Let's do a more strange example of the addition, which we do not have any particularity as mentioned before. But if it is the same as the addition of 2 to 8, which is added with 2 to 8, this means that I have 2 from these 2 to 8. Think that it was an alpha and alpha that makes us 2alpha. So it is 2 because 2 is 8, which is 2 because 2 is 8. The second is the first, and the second is the first. We have 5 in the first row and 5 in the second row. We can now calculate the same number of the 5 in the fourth row. We will continue with each of the more common examples of the two forces, but now we will change the identity of the ball. We can write it in a different way. If you don't remember, you can read it in a book. 1, 2, 10 is 2 to the power of 1, 10. So, we have a problem with the particularity we studied earlier. We add 9 and 1 to the power of 1. So, 1, 2, 1 is 2 to the power of 1. So, what can we see? We can see that if we connect 2 forces with the same power, We can remove the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of value of the value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of value of We can see that the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the 7 is the 5th, since it is 1 2 7 at the 5th point and 7 at the 5th point is 1 2 7 at the 5th point, the class becomes simple and this is done at the 5th point. So we have 7 at the 4th point again. Play with such examples and try to write some more analytical choices of the values and I think you will get a very good picture for the two forces. The number of the values in the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the upper class is 7. But the Let's look at something. The 4th is not 4. I can give it 2 to the 2nd. So we have clearly explained the difference between the 2nd and the 2nd. The 2nd is 2 to the 2nd. and the address of the 262 will be 209. With this last example, you may have missed a little bit, but if you watch a video or read the details of the book, I think that all will be cleared your head. Have a great time."

That's perfect You've got your feet hips and shoulders lined up in a complimentary manner alongside the leading edge of the club face grip both hands are working pretty well as a unit and You've got a pretty good tilt to your spine angle things I mentioned We get a little too crowded there with your hands near your legs because you tend to sit back on your heels with most of your body weight. So if we could have more of a tilt from your hips forward like you see me doing with the right, that'll enable you to be more in the middles or centers of your feet evenly with your body weight so you're better balanced. And by doing that you might have just to step back slightly to accommodate having space and place for that positioning. We're going to watch this thing go back from the starting point. You can see how you take it back with your arms and hands, the golf club and a fairly neutral direct path, which is good. From there, your arms are in a right the golf club up over your back shoulder. A little bit of an over swing but you do hold on to it pretty well so it's not wiggling around. But what happens is that we get a little bit of weight on the outside of your right foot and you can see how that right leg of yours locks a little bit. The left knee pops out instead of keeping say a flex in both. And that's something you'll be able to do by having a little more room and balance. You'll be able to turn and maintain and you see you had a little bit of leg movement to accommodate the lack of balance. So from here is your good timing. You do a great job of bringing the club back down in front of your body, squaring it up, reflexing your right knee and clearing your hips through and finishing nicely. But again, the last moving parts to your swing in the future will give you more consistency or cleaner contact as part of that as you adjust to that position for all your clubs. Just balanced and turned from there.","So the things I like about your swing of the following your club head is at a 90-degree angle behind the center of the ball Club and ball in the middle of your stance and for a middle-length iron. That's perfect You've got your feet hips and shoulders lined up in a complimentary manner alongside the leading edge of the club face grip both hands are working pretty well as a unit and You've got a pretty good tilt to your spine angle things I mentioned We get a little too crowded there with your hands near your legs because you tend to sit back on your heels with most of your body weight. So if we could have more of a tilt from your hips forward like you see me doing to the right, that'll enable you to be more in the middles or centers of your feet evenly with your body weight so you're better balanced. And by doing that, you might have just to step back slightly to accommodate having space and place for that positioning. We're going to watch this thing go back from the starting point.

Ahora vamos a ver cómo van nuestros frijoles. Les he estado echando agua constantemente para que no se peguen y bueno cuando ya estén así suavecitos que se rompa el grano quiere decir que ya están listos ahora vamos a necesitar una licuadora vamos a poner los frijoles en la licuadora y después le vamos a agregar un poco del caldo de pollo que nos quedó de las pechugas de pollo, le vamos a poner las hojas de aguacate y los chiles de árbol y lo vamos a licuar. Tiene que quedar muy bien licuado. En una cacerola aparte vamos a poner una cucharadita de aceite vegetal o aceite de oliva y lo dejamos calentar bien y enseguida ponemos nuestra salsa de frijoles que acabamos de licuar. Los asonamos de sal y si queremos la podemos echar un poquito de agua para que en una sartén aparte vamos a empezar a freír nuestras tortillas de preferencia con aceite en spray para que no nos queden tan grasosas las tortillas tenemos nuestro sartén caliente ponemos la tortilla por 30 segundos aproximadamente le damos la vuelta lo dejamos por 30 segundos otra vez y después la retiramos y así hacemos el mismo procedimiento con las demás tortillas aquí tengo mis frijoles sirviendo aquí tengo mis tortillas que las tengo friendo y aquí las que ya voy sacando y este es mi plato donde voy a preparar mis enfrijoladas y así es como lo vamos a hacer voy a tomar una de las tortillas que ya freí la voy a sumergir en la salsa de frijoles, la voy a dar vuelta la voy a sumergir bien y la voy a poner en el plato donde voy a preparar mis enfrijoladas le voy a poner pollo y la voy a cerrar y hago el mismo procedimiento con todas las tortillas que me quiera yo comer en las enfrijoladas cuando ya las termine yo de preparar las acomodo bonito y las baño con la salsa de frijoles tiene que quedar muy bien bañadas de frijoles después le voy a agregar un poco de queso fresco cebolla picada crema y le voy a agregar también unas ramitas de pasote o cilantro y listo, delicioso estas enfrijonadas se pueden disfrutar en el almuerzo comida o cena espero que les guste","Hello, in this tutorial I will show you how to make delicious frijoladas. Let's start! First we are going to clean the frijoles very well, then we are going to wash them with water and we are going to fill them a little bit on top of the level of the frijoles and we are going to put them to boil. We are going to keep boiling for around 3 hours, 3 hours and a half, but if you have an express pot, it is ... it takes like 40 minutes. add 3 cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt cut the onion and cut it into small pieces remove the seeds and we will need some avocado leaves we are going to pull it with the fork and so we do it with all the chicken and we separate it now we are going to see how these chickens go I have been constantly pouring water for them to not stick and well when they are already so soft that they break the big one means that they are ready now we are going to need a blender we are going to put the chickens in the blender and then we are going to add a little chicken broth that we have add the avocado leaves and the garlic and the garlic cloves and in a separate pan we will start frying our tortillas preferably with oil and spray so that the tortillas do not remain so greasy we have our hot pan we put the tortilla for 30 seconds approximately we turn it over and leave it for 30 seconds again and then we remove it and so we do the same procedure with the other tortillas here I have my beans serving here I have my tortillas that I have them frying and here the ones that I am already taking out and this is my dish where I am going to prepare my fried beans and that's how we are going to do it I am going to take one of the tortillas that I fried I am going to submerge it in the sauce of beans I am going to turn it around I am going to submerge it well and I am going to put it on the plate where I am going to prepare my fried beans I am going to put chicken I will close it and I do the same procedure with all the tortillas that I want to eat in the frying pan when I finish preparing them I accommodate them nicely and I bathe them with the frying sauce, it has to be very well bathed with beans, then I am going to add a little fresh cheese, chopped onion, cream and I am also going to add a few and ready! delicious! these frijoladas can be enjoyed in lunch, lunch or dinner I hope you like it"

Continua a mil, cara, o Beixão, o Mavisimo de da Top Tim e porra, através dos anos do seu Claudi lá, conheci o Victor, que foi da Brasília Top Team mas que se tornou um grande amigo meu do meu irmão, estibul e a gente tá sempre fazendo intercâmbio ele me ajudou muito nessa preparação hoje ele se machucou, não põe ter nada mas ficou ali me dando orientação bom então graças a Deus estou com suporte muito bom aí tirando essa galera toda do Vale Tida da teu Fernando Correia que me ajudou no Muay Thai e o seu Claude lá na Nobre Art então graças a Deus estou muito bem preparado a parte de musculação físico que eu fiz aqui no radar com a ajuda do Delta o Nelo então a galera toda me ajudou, estou indo conscientemente A parte de chão você fez com toda na casa, com o Dresquinho? Eu acho que o que mudou, cara, você é um cara que lutou e venceu sem luva, três lutas na mesma noite, agora você vai fazer, teoricamente seria mais tranquilo, uma luta com luva e tudo mais, e você é bem diferente daquele seu início pra hoje. É verdade, antigamente, no caso assim, na Gira era um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que tinha um cara que Hoje em dia teres de luva, regras, exige mais do atleta. O atleta tem que ser hoje muito mais condicionado fisicamente, emocionalmente para não dar um golpe legal na luta. Então o esporte evoluiu muito junto com as regras, o povo adquiriu a mimirar para aceitar ele e teve que se habituar a essas regras. E foi bom para os dois lados. Quem está assistindo vai ver dois caras ali em 15 minutos vão andar o máximo de si para tentar não caltar, finalizar se isso não acontecer vai ser uma luta excelente por ponte. e os lutadores tiveram que se adaptar a isso e exigir cada vez mais deles mesmo. O que está esperando a dar essa estreia? Vai pegar um cara que é experiente, você está esperando aí? e me jogaram com ele. Na minha... no meu entender foi para ele se levantar. Eu sou um brasileiro, ganhar de brasileiro sempre é bom. Eu estou quase todos e meio sem perder. Então ele está vindo de um no-cout na categoria de cima que todos dizem que ele não era um cara muito forte para a categoria. Ele tomou no-cout. Então eu me jogaram agora com ele lá. Eu acho que me eu entender. Na vista ele seria com o pé, era desse no-cout, mas eu estou indo com a tetágua no chope dele. A mesma forma que estou dando para ele se levantar, estamos com ele. e me dando oportunidade com sempre que jure um tal FC, dependendo de ser contra quem. Eu sei que ele é um cara duro, um cara que tem um mais taibão excelente, o Ercebo sabe se defender, vem no chão, tem um chão que finaliza algumas lutas. Então, acho que estou esperando as dificuldades possíveis, todas as possíveis, mas, pô, estou preparado para, que ideia é, estou preparado para todas as dificuldades. Como você viu aí, treinamento foi severo, sempre jure, então acho que o dia de treinamento não vai ser. Se eu vou ganhar ou perder, eu não sei, isso vai decidir lá no dia, mas com o consciente que eu estou indo para fazer um bom trabalho. Como é que está o peso, o bastinho? Já está no peso, falta pouco, vai bater 7,7? É natural de 7-7, tem um pouco mais de força, que todos eles com certeza vão ter mais força ainda mais em campo no equipe desde a categoria de cima. E essa categoria 7-7, o Brasil não tem muito representante. Hoje o Jucão, eu saíro, eu doi seguido do acadêmico, só tem o Thiago Pitbull que está na fula do cinturão, o Afonso Santé. O que você espera aqui? É uma categoria que o Brasil não tem tanta tradição. É, cara, o Brasil nunca teve tantas atratas nessa categoria. Mas além de eu ter assinado agora também fez sabendo que o Paulo Thiago também que é um excelente atleta tá em vivo tá aí assinou também então agora já são três de brazucais Thiago Alves, o Pitibuco já tá lá, preste da luta pelo cinturão aí e eu e Paulo Thiago que se Deus quiser vamos reporçar o time de brazuca lá se Deus quiser vamos estrear com o pé direito aí ele também já tem estreia marcada eu acho e vamos reporçar aí o Thiago Pitibu né mas o Pitibuco como você já disse já tá lá um tempo já fez um nome lá e a gente tá começando Vamos chegar devagar aos contos e ver se a gente se firma lá no que não acho ser. Eu não sou funcionário, vou ter que aceitar esse desafio, mas vou falar que na minha cabeça nem passa isso ainda. Existe convite para o Sampoer, subite de categoria também, quem sabe até lá, subite de categoria, não sei o que passa pela cabeça dele. Mas como eu falei, estou chegando agora, não penso nisso ainda. Eu acho que o cara já está mil anos na luz lá, é o campeão, tem que ser respeitado, treinar muito, que não está muito para chegar lá nele. Então, vou passar de cada vez, estou chegando agora, deixo-me informar primeiro, conhecer o time legal, me habituar lá. Quem vai estar te acompanhando lá? Quem vai ser teu coitado? Esse irmão que treina desde o começo só já te faça aquela confiança aí com todo o juiz dele que ele sabe, que está me ensinando muito bem, então... com dois porras aí de ponta que vamos sentir muito protegidos na luta. Ah, tu vai ganhar mais uma, tá ganhando direto, mas ali são os melhores do mundo, então só mais um deles ali envolvido, então a dificuldade aumenta também. Tá bom, tá neveta de fonte, tudo o mais também você vai pegar a cara top, então o risco de perder é maior do que aqui no Brasil, porque quando você vê, todo mundo vai falar, tem o favorito, tudo mais. A responsabilidade aumentou, mas porém, vou melhorar mais também, vou ambituar lá, como disse, as regras, ultimamente, vou melhorar cada vez mais. E se Deus quiser trazer muitas alegrias para o brasileiro aí. Valeu, obrigado, Bachinho. Obrigado a vocês aí.","I'm here with Alexandre Bachinho, I just finished 3 rounds of 5 minutes with the help of the waitress, the brotherhood, the top of the list, the people, everything, I just wanted to show you that he's in the place, he's prepared. It's Dudu, thank God, there's a very good crowd giving support, besides my brother and Chimu who have always been with me, the blessing, the most important of the Top Team, and through the years of your Claudio there, I met Victor, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part of this team, I'm very happy to be a part I'm very patient, I'm very calm, I think I'll be able to do a good performance. I'm very trained, I'm very well-accessed, so I'm not worried about anything with the fight, just come there and fight. I think that you changed, man, you are a guy who fought and defeated without gloves, three fights at the same night, now you are going to have, theoretically, it would be more peaceful, a fight with gloves and everything else, and you are a different person from your beginning to today. Yes, it's true, in the past, in the case of Najira, But, these rules of today, with the one that is updated, the fighter must demand more from him, he demands from all the coaches, physical training, he demands more from his athlete, because he has a time of 15 minutes. In the past, the fights were half an hour, so there was no time. Sometimes, like, the fight that was recently, Royce Caetano was fighting with Calphe Hermes, he was there, he had that tied fight. And today, no one wants to have more of that, no one wants to see action. If the fight falls, the video will be tied, so the most important thing is to keep it tied. Because nowadays, there are rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, rules And the fighters had to adapt to that and they had to do it more and more. What changed about the fighter's low? The time to beat him? As I told you, I had to get used to the new rules and I'm the guy who was fighting without a fight until today. I trust my hand, I beat my hand, I beat the cut, I know that there are people who beat the same way, but I even preferred it. But it's okay, I think that time to beat him, what I acquired a lot was my best one from West, in the ground, that time I was very good at Muay Thai, I decided to go down to the field and they played with him. My understanding was that he had to get up, I'm a Brazilian, I always win, I'm almost four years old and I don't lose. He's coming from the knockout, from the top, everyone says he's not a very strong man, he took the knockout, so I think he's going to play with him, I think he's going to get up, I think he's going to play with the knockout, but I'm trying to put water in his face. The same way I'm giving him to get up, I'm giving you the opportunity to fight in such a way that you can fight against anyone. I know that you have a tough guy, a guy who has a good attitude, excellent wrestling, you know, defending yourself on the ground, you have a ground that ends up in some fights. So I think you're expecting as much difficulty as possible, but I'm prepared for whatever it is, I'm prepared for all the difficulties. As you saw, training was severe, I know that it's hard, so I think that with training it won't be. If I win or lose, I don't know, and it will decide on the day, but I'm aware that I'm going to do a good job. How is the weight, Gachinho? Are you already on the weight? Do you want to fight? No, I also, when I'm on this fight, I know that all the gringos lose a lot of weight. I also try to increase my weight, I have a Russian friend, who is the owner of the body lab, he lives here in Rada. He gave me an supplement, he gave me things to increase in weight. So I also increased in weight, I will have to do a dehydration also to reduce the weight. How much weight? I'm about 83 kilos, I even want to have more. I'm starting to go down now, I'm starting to lose weight. It's a natural level of 77, there's a bit more strength, they all have more strength in the top category. In this level of 77 Brazil doesn't have a lot of representatives. Today, Jucau is leaving the academy, Thiago Pitbull is in the center of the belt. What do you expect from a level where Brazil doesn't have so much tradition? Brazil has never had so many athletes in this category. But I also signed up for the match against Thiago, who is also an excellent athlete. Thiago Alves and I are already there, he is already there. Let's get to the point, we'll see if we can sign on the table. You know, it's coming now, but it's inevitable that the head of the striker is already in that hole, if I can win there and be in the head, we'll hear the whistle. For the central, it's in the hand of the Sampiazri, who is your friend, a friend of the Rapa Viada. How do you see it? Would you face him if you had this opportunity? Well, of course I would have to face him, if I could fight well, I'm not a professional, I'll have to accept this challenge. But I'll say that this doesn't even happen in my head. There are some who have a lot of experience in this category, who know what happens in their head. But I don't think about it yet. I think that the guy who's been in the league for a thousand years is the champion, he has to be respected. He has to train a lot, he doesn't have to be there to get there. So, I'll go every time I get there. I'll let myself be the first. I'll meet my usual team there. I have to get used to this rules of the elbow, because I had to do it in a very short time, and I had to fight in a valley, and the guys know how to use it, so I have to get used to it. It's something to think about a long time ahead, so it's not the right time to think about it now, you have to think about it every time, and in the future, maybe, yes, I'll have to fight in the future. Who will be following you there? Who will be your partner? My professor, Ari Galo, is already in Italy, he went to the seminars there in Alexandria, and they'll be the two of my brothers. My brother is a coach. I've been training since the beginning, so trust me. Of course, my brother is my brother, I like him, I don't like him, he's my favorite position, so my brother is my brother, he's like two guys against one, he's seeing what I'm not seeing, he's seeing what I like to do, so he'll give me the tips, and I'll be there, he's there, he's with me. I'm going to fight him, he's teaching me well, so... I'm going to fight him with two legs, I'm going to feel protected in the fight. I'm not sure if I'm winning or not, but the best players in the world are there, so I'm one of them involved. The difficulty is increasing, the score is good, the score is good, everything is going to be fine. The risk of losing is higher than that in Brazil, because when you see everyone talking about their favorite, everything, but the responsibility has increased, but I'm going to improve more, I'm going to be there with the rules, I'm going to improve more and more, and if God wants to bring many happiness, it's for the Brazilian. Thank you very much, thank you very much."

Last year I helped open Riverside School here in sixth grade and I'm continuing this year in sixth grade language arts and math. I have a degree in design and business and worked and then had a family and stayed home and I spent all of my free time in the schools with my children. So I got my teacher's license. This is my second year. There is a lot of work that goes into preparing for lessons, a lot of grading stuff. The time spent in the evenings and on the weekends during the school year kind of overcompensates for the time that we have off. But it is nice to have that time in the summer to kind of refresh and rejuvenate and look through what happened the year, what can I do better next year and be prepared to start again. Many of our teachers work the first full week after school, setting up curriculum. To prepare for school, I went to a few workshops. I read some professional development books. In beginning about mid-July is when I started gathering school supplies and thinking about what I want in my room to look like and starting to make plans for this year. The school does give us some money at the end of each year to buy supplies for the next year. But there is some money that's out of pocket as far as buying supplies for the kids who might not have them to keep in my room so they can can borrow or buy new bulletin board materials. There are always things you want to buy. There are little things that maybe a student needs or doesn't have a school box or just more decorations you want for your room. There's always a new book that you might like to have. I just bought two chairs and a lamp so my kids will have a little reading area. I bought a new tree this year and hung some stuffed animals in the hat and I really like to do as much with science as I can so my new little science center over here is going to be exciting. It would be the kid who finally got an A on a math test or the kid who said, oh my gosh, I didn't know that I loved reading until you showed me this book. And it was little things like that along the way that I felt like I'm doing the right thing. When you see them as a whole accomplish something that you've been working on, it's just a great feeling. And to know that you're a part of that is wonderful. First grade is all about learning to read. And when they can, after working so hard to get there, It's just very exciting. I had one little girl who thought my great work board. She told me that she thought it was baby-ish, but she likes that I appreciated their work. So I think they can see my heart in it.","This is my second year of teaching.

Yo siento que el cambio climático es un problema muy grande y que nos afecta a todos, incluyendo a ustedes ahí en casa. Nosotros y nosotras aquí tenemos el poder de poder decir algo, de que escuchen nuestras voces como la juventud. Su entonces cada acción que puedas ustedes hacer, no importa si es chiquita o grande, cuenta. ¿Qué les parece el cambio climático en la luta? los jóvenes tenemos que asumir ese compromiso. Cada año muran 315 mil personas, según los informes de los expertos, por las consecuencias del cambio climático. Nuestra energía como jóvenes también tiene que servir para decirle a los políticos que estamos aquí, que les estamos vigilando y que queremos que ejecuten normas que hagan leyes que trabajen y que nos ayuden a dar ese marco legal que nos ayudará hacer más responsables con nuestro planeta. El cambio climático y el ambiente en general son un asunto fundamental, particularmente sabiendo que los líderes del mundo no están tan comprometidos con el tema como deberían estar. La solución está en los nuevos líderes y en las nuevas generaciones. es tiempo de hacer algo. Si aprendemos a salvar y proteger la tierra, podemos crear una identidad todos y todas alrededor de la tierra. el mundo, una ciudad que es sostenible planetaria. de cambio climático es fundamental y es una amenaza real para todos los países del mundo. Insto a otros jóvenes de mi país a que se involucren y se informen acerca de las cumbres de cambio climático y las cumbres ambientales que se están dando alrededor del mundo. En el caso de Nueva York y también en los casos de Copenhague y de México. Le pido a los y las jóvenes de mi país que con el conocimiento de las políticas que se están tomando para reducir la emisión de gases y con todas las que se están utilizando para generar un impacto verdadero, humemos actuaciones que sean acordes a lo que se está pidiendo a nivel mundial. Diego Padilla desde Nueva York para Planeta Interna. Yo como joven Costa Ruizense, opino que actualmente la humanidad está enfrentando un desafío enorme que es salvaguardar todo nuestro recurso naturales, sino también para que a largo plazo las futuras generaciones puedan contar con ellos y puedan disfrutarlos de la manera en que nosotros lo estamos haciendo ahorita. Para mí es básico que el gobierno, los gobiernos, los jefes de estado tomen políticas que de verdad puedan ayudar al medio ambiente. Desde Nueva York para Planeta Interno les habla Adriana Casafonte Costa Rica. de la conservación de los recursos naturales. Estoy en este momento trabajando precisamente sobre cómo hacerle frente a los efectos del clima en la producción agrícola y veo día a día el sufrimiento de nuestras gente centroamericana y mi país en particular. Como mujer joven viviendo en Nueva York me gustaría decir que deberíamos educarnos a nosotros mismos, hacer que las condiciones actuales de la vida.","We have a special program dedicated to climate change. We are going to take you to three events. Our friend and colleague, Yisela Galliani, was in New York and brings you an interesting report of the World Youth, what do young people think about climate change? the youth's voice concert celebrating the UN Day. We will also be at the University of Costa Rica, meeting the UN World Cup 350. So you know what is special about global warming today. This is the International Planet. We were gathered at the UN General Assembly with all the leaders of the countries. We were communicating our ideas, the solutions we have and that we have to start taking action. I think climate change is a very big problem and it affects us all, including you and at home. We and we here have the power to say something, to hear our voices like the youth. So, every action you can make, no matter if it's small or big, counts. We have to raise our voices now because we are the generation of the future. Climate change should take an important place in the education. I think that as young people we can't put much more time into the commitment to global warming. Today, we have heard very nice phrases but I think that we can't do it. We must take this commitment. Every year, 315,000 people die, according to the reports of experts, due to the consequences of climate change. Our energy as young people must also be used to define the policies we are here, to be watched by them and to want them to execute laws that they work on and that help us to give that legal framework that will help us to be more responsible for our planet. Climate change and the environment in general are a fundamental issue, particularly knowing that the leaders of the world are not as committed to the topic as they should be. Therefore, I think that the solution is in the new leaders and in the new generations. It's time to do something. We want to motivate young people to act. The future is in their hands. It's time for new ideas and a new ethics. What can you do? Many times we like to talk to great leaders of the world about this and refer to the missions of being good or of the great companies. But maybe I can do something If we learn to save and protect the land, we can create an identity, all and all around the world. and the world. A sustainable, planetary citizen. the to generate a real impact, we are aiming for actions that are in accordance with what is being asked at the global level. Diego Padilla from New York for the Interloon Planet. They can have them and they can enjoy them the way we are doing it right now. For me it is basic that the government, the governments, the heads of state take policies that can really help the environment. From New York to the internal planet Adriana Casa Font Costa Rica speaks to them. conservation of natural resources. I am currently working on how to deal with the effects of climate in agricultural production and I see the suffering of our Central American people and my country in particular. As a young woman living in New York, I would like to say that we should educate ourselves to make the conditions I want to share with other young people as a citizen of the world that today we have new challenges and we need to walk together to make the change."

He is admired Internationally by women and chefs as a representative of the highest standards. Though in Leng Lie's heart there is a regret from a Valentines Day two years in the past, as singer/songwriter Guan Xiao Shu suddenly hit the big time. Xiao Shu and Leng Lie grew up together as close friends until one day, Valentine's Day, Leng Lie decided to confess his feelings. Unfortunately, an unexpected accident took place that day. Xiao Shu was victim of a car accident which stole her eyesight. Feeling responsible, Leng Lie decided to take care of Xiao Shu's future, but not wanting a love based on remorse, Xiao Shu rejected him.    One day Xiao Shu entered the ""Fried Rice with Egg"" diner. The simple and plain fried rice she ate there had an odd effect on her. She felt relaxed and carefree. Odder still, the cook who prepared the meal could only cook eggs and rice. Michelin was new and a rather bumbling chef. Though Michelin possesed a latent talent for cooking he only relied on the skills his father had passed on to him. With this, he had earned himself a reputation and an income in the vilage by producing 100 plates of fried rice with egg each day. Though, upon meeting Xiao Shi the many flavors of food and love opened up to him. Likewise, Michelin's frank nature gives Xiao Shu the ability to cultivate an independent lifestyle. All the while, Leng Lie has stayed by Xiao Shu's side secretly aiding her, witnessing the growing feelings between Xiao Shu and Michelin.

After 5 months of filming, it will be on the stage of the 8th TV station in the city. Wang Dongcheng is acting as a cooking chef who is good at cooking. To show his handsome side, although he is filming in winter, he must wear the summer clothes. He is handsome and has a weak acting. Because he is not good at cooking, I am good at cooking. I am good at cooking. I am good at cooking. The director asked him to practice and throw the egg shell into the deep hole. I think this is better than... After a few tries, the color is naturally beautiful. Come on, let's do it again. This is the romantic date between Min Qilin and Uncle Xiao in the sea. But the audience and the actors feel different. It's too romantic. You have to play the role of the light. Okay. Then the spirit of the middle. Open your eyes and do the play. The role is hard to play. It's harder to play with the people who are lost. It's the Yuzhe who drives, and he hit the car a lot. But the scene in a few minutes, it's a long time. When other staffs are busy, our Yuzhe can't help but to be a fool. After the drama with Yuzhe, it's a two-person relationship. The action of the love sister was shot by us alone. The crew immediately took the ambulance and confirmed that there was no problem. Now let's take you to see what kind of game the actors are playing. I said, Xiao Xun, are you a little over? Xiao Xun, please forgive me. Don't look at Yu Zhe's handsome eyes. It seems that there is such a thing. But what does Yu Zhe say? It's quite childish. I'll use a fan to test him. You can play like this. She must know this game is very good. It's like... This game is called... A game of the same person. I'm very happy to play this game with this game of the same person. Because I have a free user. It's here. Where is the hook? It's here. This scene is the scene of Hai Xiu's Mi Qi Ling and Uncle Shu kissing. I won't give it to you. Such an important screen. Of course, you can only see it when you're officially broadcast."

It could be doing something faster. It could be process improvement. It could be getting an organization in place.

They need to understand the project attributes. I said, great. What are they not doing? That's the next question. And Bill struggled a little bit. He said, well, you know, they're not making as many sales calls as I'd like to be. And while some of the initial leads were good, the quality leads probably really aren't happening very well right now. And so then I asked the next question. And I call really this one the money question. Why are they not doing it? Now, again, I'm like everybody else, right? Everything you watch on TV is reality. So this is a common way to think about it. If I were to do a live game show in your businesses and I told your people, if I offered you $1 million to do what I asked you to do, could they do it? A lot of times the answer is yes. And if the answer is yes, guess what? Don't go train them again. Because some of the things that you talked about are bad training, or actually because you're training against the wrong problem.

I'm one of the exceptions. I took up the game later in life and enjoying the outdoors and recreation seemed like a natural bit. So I became a golf professional, got into the game, learned how to play the education. Oh, nice. And therefore turned it to a career. Very cool. Now, go time span to get certified. I know. You know, it depends on the individual, but you basically need to go through about a business degree, you know, with a golf emphasis to be able to do it. So, you know, most, I would say between three to five years depending on the individual. Oh, too bad.

Luckily you have us being there telling you what's hot and what's going on with our celebrities and where they're partying at. And our first stop... Yo, the other night when we went out? Tell us? Vanity. Vanity at the Hotness. I think I know who you're talking about. Are you talking about Jersey Shore's very old situation? He was doing well. He wasn't creeping like I saw him on the show. No he wasn't but he was with a couple other guys. I couldn't believe it when I saw him with those people. You saw him? Yeah, he was with Brody Jenner and Bow Wow. What a combination together. Yeah, that was a little weird. I didn't expect those three to be hanging out at Vanity. You and me and Hulk are mating together. What wouldn't work? I think so. But we were at Vanity at the Hard Rock Hotel in Casino and that was definitely the place to be. I mean that spot, it's almost like a boutique nightclub. You know it has an intimate small feel to it. Well yeah, when we were all sitting around together and just the flow, everyone going together, it was just phenomenal. You were on your A-game. Oh dude, you were so much fire, I couldn't handle it. This kid made the situation look like nothing out there. I'm sorry, I just played the wink to Chris. But speaking of situations, we stopped off at another place that week. Lavo inside the Palazzo?

Un saludo para todos. momento que quiero grabar el momento que quiero y esos temas hoy se manejan nada hoy daría la vida con dimpo y vido por la mala vida y algunos otros pues surgieron exactamente de eso de el simple gusto por hacer rápido y hacer lo que nos plazca y necesidad de rente en la cuenta sonar y por por circunstancias x y amadas no quieras simplemente hacer lo que nos gusta y todo el resto El video fue muy sencillo, también de Vinci Doria. para para ir a grabar el vídeo ya este vídeo tenía algo que se estaba planeando pero que nunca se había dado algo al serio o sea simplemente se había quedado en clálicas lavamos el vídeo en bateguilla en la calera y pues realmente nos desesperamos para todos la producción y la producción y planeación de este vídeo pues faltaron muchos aspectos que cubrir y no no tenis sol. Este es el disco Vinci Lomnia. Es una producción de 14 temas que acaba de salir a la beta y es una producción de 14 temas que se grabó en Sigla en Records a principios del 2010 y lo terminamos por ahí de octubre, noviembre más o menos. Ya la postproducción pues está a cargo de Maxo de inalcanzable Records desde no siempre por cierto un saludo Y bueno, es una producción que significa mucho en mi vida por lo que implico en cuanto a las semáticas, en cuanto a las letras. También es un disco que está muy variado, o sea, no está enfocado simplemente en algún aspecto en especial. Trae algunos temas, carcore, algo romaticón, trae algunos beats por ahí, trae una sesión instrumental a cargo de Maxo, trae colaboraciones con liricul, amor eterno, pero Lo que quieras, no hay límites, estás totalmente libre de hacer lo que te plazca. Sabes que no le puedes hacer. Bueno, ese ha sido un tema muy polémico. Últimamente me han preguntado mucho acerca de eso. En realidad no me gusta hablar mucho de eso porque seguir dando de importancia a gente que no la merece. Entonces yo mejor me restero mis comentarios en lo que está. En tanto en el Ed, como en el mío, la gente ya está juzgando por chisola, la gente se está dando cuenta de cómo son las cosas, de cómo se sugieron las cosas. Simplemente, soy tranquilo, porque la gente me ha brindado su apoyo. Y sé que estar conmigo pase lo que pase. Muchas veces... Ya son cinco discografías, la primera que salió en el 2008, se llamó por Simescuá. Un Maxi estuvo descargable y disponible, totalmente gratis, después fue linea enferma con estilo, una larga duración que también está descargable. Salió Libini Negotria, Vince D'Ovnia que desde el 9 en disco más representativo de Bucamayos fue mi primer larga duración. salió prácticamente tres semanas grabamos el solo con Maxi de cuatro canciones con colaboraciones de colosinómano, Max o el más de todas las canciones y bueno servidor Boca Mayer en las letras y 2012 que va a ser algo muy, está siendo algo muy, muy ambicioso podríamos decirlo así el Mayer's Push, ya se está grabando en en Masacro Records, en Inadversal de Records también algunos temas. ¿Qué tiene especial esto? Que va a ser un disco lleno de colaboraciones únicamente con Freestyleers, con los mejores Freestyleers de México, bueno que yo considero, los mejores Freestyleers de México. Un disco totalmente hardcore entonces creo que eso todavía lo hace más apetecible. entonces se que les va a gustar mucho va a estar a cargo igual de maxon en alcanzables records y masacre records","We are going to talk about my album, Vince and Domia. Greetings to everyone. I want to record the moment I want. And those songs, today they are called Infernal, today they would give life with Dimple and lived for the bad life and some others, they came out exactly that, right? The simple taste for fast music and doing what we like, and the need to realize that nobody, for circumstances, makes you call them whatever you want, simply do what we like and everything else. The video was very simple, it was a very simple production. to record the video. This video had something that was planned but that had never been something serious, it had just been planned. We recorded the video in Bateguilla in the canary and we really waited for the production. In fact, in the production and planning of this video, many aspects were missing. This is Vinci Lovnia, a record production of 14 songs that just came out to the beta. It's a record production of 14 songs that was recorded in record label at the beginning of 2010 and we finished it in October, November, more or less. The post-production is in charge of max, of unreachable records, from December, for 100%, for a certain health. It's a production that means a lot of my life, so I'm involved in the themes, in the lyrics. It's also a record that's very varied, it's not focused on any specific aspect. It has some songs, some romantic, it has some beats, it has an instrumental session, a max charge, it has collaborations with lyrical, eternal love, I wrote this song in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the book, I wrote it in the, I wrote it in the, I wrote it in the, I wrote it in the, I wrote it in the, I wrote it in You can do whatever you want, there are no limits. You are totally free to do whatever you want. You know you can't do it. Well, that has been a very controversial topic lately. I have been asked a lot about that. Actually, I don't like talking about that much because it is still important to people who don't deserve it. So I better leave my comments on what it is. I'm in my own place, and people are already playing around. People are realizing how things are, how things were created. I'm just calm, because people have given me their support. I know they're with me, so let's do what we can. Many times... It was very good, it was a maxi, it was downloadable and available, totally free, then it was in sick condition, with style, a long duration that is also downloadable. It came out in the book Negotria, Vince and Dognia, which since the 9th in the representative album of Bucamayos, was my first long duration. We recorded a max of 4 songs with the collaboration of the synomano, the max of all the songs, and the server of Boca Maida in the lyrics. And 2012, which is going to be very ambitious, we could say so. The Maida's Push It is already recording in the studio. in Massacre Records, in Inadversable Records, also in some songs. And what is special about this? It's going to be a full disc of collaborations, only with Freestyleers, with the best Freestyleers in Mexico, or whatever I consider the best Freestyleers in Mexico. A totally hardcore disc, so I think that still makes it more desirable. So I know you will like it a lot, it will be the same as Max on the reachable records and the most accurate records."

La lectura del telón ensayo de siete partes escrito por Milan Kundera el capítulo de la página 109 al 124. Ah, ah, ah. Sí, profe, pero... tengo algunas dudas y es... ¿Por qué dicen que la música y la poesía pueden ir más lejos que la pintura en el irismo? Pues veras Lucía, es porque tanto en la música como en la poesía, al hombre deslombrado por su propia alma y por el deseo de que sea escuchada, dejando así su propio ser desnudo. ¿Un cirujano goza de gloria? La gloria en sí, es un desequilibrio, como la de los artistas sin que lo uso la de los políticos. Muy bien Lucía. Realmente es un orgullo tenerte como estudiante. Jejeje gracias profe, sabes, que me causa un gran impacto? En el sub capítulo de, ¿Han matado a mi Albertine? El que Albertine hubiese sido todo el tiempo en el libro un hombre, siendo descrito como una mujer? Eso, demuestra una cosa. y es que el artista debe hacer creer una cosa distinta al lector de lo que escribe. Si, es muy cierto Lucita y en el niño y su abuela. Viste como deja ver que el autor es el único dueño de lo que escribe o hace. Si, Profe, creo que eso me fue de gran ayuda para no tener que darle explicaciones a nadie cuando voto arrugó un escrito mío porque precisamente es mío, solo mío y eso hace que pueda hacer lo que quiera con él. sabes. También recuerdo que decían que la novela es una única creación del autor. ¿Cómo la novela de Cervantes, Don Quijote? Que linda Lucía, presagió un gran futuro para ti y desde luego para el quiz que haren un rato.","Beautiful! You already did the task? Which teacher? The reading of the 7-part essay by Milan Kundera in chapter 109 to 124. Ah, yes teacher, but I have some doubts. Why do they say that music and poetry can go further than painting in lyricism? Well, you see Lucía, it's because both in music and poetry, the man dazzled by his own soul and by the desire that he is heard, leaving his own being naked. Do you think you're going to cut me off? Well, no. You see, the characteristic of a celebrity is that he has wanted to be a celebrity and that is achieved when the number of those who know him clearly surpasses the number of those who he knows himself. And tell me, a gypsy girl of glory? No, teacher, of course not. What happens there is that patients and colleagues feel admiration for him, but not the public, living like that in balance. The glory itself is a imbalance, like the one of the artists without which I use it, of the politicians. Very well Lucía. Really, it is an honor to have you as a student. GG, thank you prof. You know what I have caused a great impact? In the South, chapter of Have you killed my Albertine? The one that Albertine had been all the time in the book A man being described as a woman? That shows a thing. And it is that the artist must make believe a different thing to the reader of what he writes. Yes, it is very true Lucita and in the child and her grandmother. Did you see how she lets the author see? Is the only owner of what he writes or does? Yes, teacher, I think that, it was great help for me, not to have to give explanations to anyone when I vote or ask for a write-me-o, because it is precisely my, only mine and that makes it possible to do what I want with it. You know, I also remember that they said that the novel is a single creation of the author. Like the novel of Cervantes, Don Quijote? How beautiful Lucia, he foretold a great future for you and of course for the quiz he will do in a while."

Se esse ativo, em vez de buscar o nosso objetivo, fizer isso aqui ele reverte a tendência de alta. Então, o nosso stop é posicionado para a saída da posição se ela reverte a tendência de alta dela. Inclusive, seria algo realmente bem negativo que tenderia ultrapassar facilmente esses 17,45 reais caso isso aconteça. Mas, por enquanto, aspecto favorável pelo R$ 1,60 a gente observa que foi a saída de uma grande região de congestão. Vamos ver se amanhele consegue até superar a máxima do pregão de hoje que foi de R$ 19,41 aumentando a importância dessa saída do G60 com chance de buscar de novo a região dos R$ 20 e até uma resistência intermediária na faixa dos R$ 20,55. A RZZ3 a gente já tinha falado dessa ação se conseguisse superar os R$ e colocar um stop aqui embaixo em R$35,61. Como o rompimento desses R$37,09 aconteceu só no elenão de fechamento, deram uma bela puxada em cima da R$10,03 para cima, seguimos com entrada na mesma ponta. Qual é o ponto de entrada dessa ação? Deixe-me colocar essa linha aqui para baixo. O ponto de entrada dela é R$37,10,00. centavos. Então ela teria que voltar a cair um pouco para fazer essa compra aqui de curto prazo. A gente tem uma compra nela de médio prazo. Então a compra em 37 reais e 10 centavos. Voltando gera essa compra em 37 e 10 aciona a compra em 37 e 10 no próximo pregão e stop em 35 e 61. Operação de 4% objetivo dessa operação 38 e 59. Nós já temos uma compra nela de médio em 36 e 40 com o stop em 31 e 60. Objetivo acima dos R$1. JHSF3 ativa tendência de alta de médio prazo que nós executamos uma compra dela. A compra dela aconteceu aqui nos R$8. E stoppem 6,95, o objetivo é 9,05, a operação de 13% assim como da RZZ3 é a operação mais longa. Mas essa ação fechou aí bem já no G60, pega o G60 dela, traça ali as existências, essa máxima que é 8,15, mais tocada, mais importante já fechou bem. Mas como foi puxado no leilão, a chance de comprar essa ação ao superar a máxima de hoje que foi 8,18 e esses 8,18 que já tinha comentado na videoaunares. Então a chance de compra nessa ação é 8,19, 8,19 reais e depois dessa entrada em 8,19 reais, o stop dessa operação ficará em 7,81 reais. posição de 4,6% o objetivo dessa operação em 8,57 reais. ELPL4, o FIC de olho que a gente mandou uma compra nessa ação na superação dos 18,75 reais, cancelada essa operação temporariamente cancelada, vamos avaliar de novo no G60 porque ela rompeu os 18,45, foi perder o força, voltou aqui, não anulou esse quendo de alto, vamos acompanhar aí a abertura do pregão, podemos ainda jogar uma entrada nessa ação na superação dos 18,75, mas após a avaliar o início do pregão, principalmente a primeira hora de pregão dela. Então segue aí no nosso monitorando, mas não necessariamente o fico de olho dessa ação está cancelado da forma como foi passada anteriormente. TOTS 3 fechou o pregão bem, a alta de 2,49%. Essa também teve uma bela puxada e de mais de 1% para cima. formou um fundo no gráfico diário em cima de uma congestão anterior se pega ali o gráfico semanal 41,36 então enfim em cima de um ponto antigo de resistência funcionando como suporte aqui ficou patinando patinando veio aqui gerou um gap mais conseguiu reverter esse gap com um golfe de alto volume acima da média abrir até chance de compra nos 42 reais com stop aqui em 40,61 e projetando risco para cima mas vamos optar por aguardar um pouco mais a monitora de satífo devido ao leilão que deram uma puxada boa para cima aguardando algum tipo de congestão que é um movimento que ela faz mais com frequência para depois gerar uma compra nela com stopper que é um pouco mais bem protegido e por último a garrita IP3 apenas para mencionar a gente abriu o video chat falando desse papel que estava gerando ali uma sinalização de alta positiva pelo g60 Primeiro falar do gráfico diário, ação montou um pivo de alta no pregão de ontem com grande quendo de alto, volume acima da média. Não, para mim não geraria compra aqui nesse nível, essa operação de rompimento já com movimento de alto. Cheguei a comentar pela manhã que o único forma que pensaria em alguma entrada seria uma correção no G60 do preço ou mesmo de forma lateral, correção no tempo. Ela acontecia uma correção no preço e essa correção no preço foi lá testar dois topos anteriores, bateu nessa região e que gerou um Kendo em golfe de alto, um Kendo de força por parte dos compradores, um Graphic 15 Minutos também gerou um sinal positivo, apoiando a um possível entrada em 506. Se alguém chegou a fazer esse tipo de entrada nessa formação nesse sinal de alta dela, 506 com stop em 476, o objetivo dessa operação de 5,9% está em torno de 5,36, 4 centavos abaixo dessa máxima desse grande Kendo de baixa. Já caminhou bem para chegar no objetivo aí e depois descer dessa subida. Enfim, G60, sinalização boa de alta, ao testar a região de R$ 5,94 vai dando indício um pouco maior de buscar até aquela região de R$ 5,79 que tende a estabelecer se for superado. Um pivô de alta no gráfico semanal é retomado a diante de alta de médio prazo nessa ação. Já retomou aqui no gráfico diário a diante de alta, ainda não é da mais importante porque está tudo dentro desse grande movimento de mas a superação desse ponto aqui tende a ser bastante importante no sentido de tornar a tendência de alta de curto prazo mais forte e também de estabelecer a tendência de alta de médio prazo. Então, é isso amigos, muito obrigado pela sua atenção e também pelo acesso de aéreo site da AutoVídero.com. Um grande abraço e até a nossa próxima video análise.","Hello friends, let's go to our video of the actions that stand out after the pregão of this Tuesday, October 16th, starting here by the GGB R4, highlight the day, especially this closing law, giving, I already commented on the Ibovespa video, they were pulled up in some papers, the GGB R4, however, but some assets I will comment here, ARZZ3, which generated a short-term entry chance, JHSF3 too, and some other papers had I will comment on the video description I think it's better to protect it from 18 and 20% risk in this position of 5.7% objective in 20.40% if this asset instead of looking for our objective did this here it reverse the high tendency so our stop is positioned to leave the position if it reverse the high tendency of it and even would be something really negative that would tend to exceed easily these 17.45% if this happens but for now favorable aspect We can see that the G60 was the exit of a large area of congestion. Let's see if tomorrow it can even exceed the maximum of the price of today, which was R$ 19.41, increasing the importance of this exit of the G60, with the chance of looking for a new region of R$ 20 and even an intermediate resistance in the area of ​​R$ 20.55. the price of the new one is $0.00, but the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of the new one is $0.00, so the price of So I would have to go back to fall a little to make this purchase here short-term we have a mid-term purchase so 37 reais and 10 cents back generates 3710 action the 3710 next loan and stop in 3561 operation of 4% objective of this operation 3859 we already have a mid-term purchase in 3640 with stop in 3160 objective above JHSF3 also activates high-end tenderness, which we run at its purchase. The purchase happened here at R$ 8, and the stop in R$ 6,95, the objective was 9,05, with a 13% operation, as in the RZZ3, a longer operation. But this one is closed already in the G60, it takes the G60, it draws the existence, this maximum here 8,15, more played, more important, it's already closed well. But as it was pulled into the law, the chance of buying this action to exceed the maximum of today, which was 8.18 and these 8.18 that I had already commented on the video analysis. So the chance of buying this action, 8.19, 8.19 reais and after this entry in 8.19 reais, the stop of this operation will be in 7.81 reais. the position of 4.6% the goal of this operation in 8,57 reais. ELPL4, the eye peak that we sent a purchase in this operation of 18,75 reais canceled this operation temporarily canceled let's evaluate again in the G60 because it broke the 18,45 reais was lost strength returned here did not cancel this high-end let's follow The pregão's opening was a bit late, but the pregão's opening was the first time. So, it's still monitoring, but the eye peak is canceled. TOTS 3 closed the pregão well, 2.49% high, and it had a nice pull, more than 1% up. formed a fund in the daily graph above a previous congestion, if you take the weekly graph 21, 30, 41, 36, so anyway above an old resistance point, working as a support, here it was pathing, pathing, came here, generated a gap, but managed to reverse this gap with a high volume gap above the average, it even opened the chance of buying at 42 reais with a stop here at 40.61 and projecting the risk up. but we will wait for the monitor to be activated due to the delay that was pulled up, waiting for some kind of congestion, which is a movement that it does more frequently, to then generate a buy on it with a stopper that is a little better protected. And finally, the HTP3, just to mention, we opened the video chat talking about this paper that was generating a high signal positive for the G60, First talk about the daily schedule, the action mounted a high pivot in the pregão de ontem with a large high-heel, volume above average. For me it would not generate a purchase here at this level, this operation of breaking with high movement. I came to comment on the only way tomorrow that I would think of entering would be a correction in the G60 of the price or even on the side, correction in time. It happened a correction in the price and this correction in the price was to test two front tops, hit in this region and generated a high-end candle, a 15-minute graph generated a positive signal, supporting the input in 506. If someone came to make this type of input in this high-end signal, 506 with a stop in 476, the goal of this operation of 5.9% is around 5.36, 4 cents below this maximum of this low-end candle. It has already changed well to get to the goal and then go down from that climb. Anyway, G60, good high signal, when testing the region of 5,494, it gives a slightly higher index of search until that region of 5,79, which tends to establish if it is exceeded. A high pivot in the weekly graph is retaken by a high maintenance of the average time in this action. It has already retaken here in the daily maintenance of the high graph, it is not yet the most important ones because everything is inside this big but the overcoming of this point here tends to be very important in the sense of making the high-end of short-term shorter and also establishing the high-end of medium-term. So, friends, thank you very much for your attention and also for the access to the website daautovíra.com. Big hug and see you in our next video analysis."

It's made up, you have to put it in its base if I can, I would have to be precise. First we need the acrylic silicone white, some objects to decorate, I have these little balls and we are going to decorate all the edges of our oven, but I advise you to do something before you start decorating it, to remove the base so you will work better, actually maybe it's better to remove the glass. Now let's decorate our oven. I'm going to put the silicone more or less in equal parts, otherwise it will be too low, too high. Now I'm going to decorate it. I'm making a video with the camera, but it's downloaded, I have to continue with the webcam. I don't know what point I have, I'll show you again. This is the frame, as I did, I put the silicone all around the frame. I put two little keys and then I put the stress stress air Now I continue putting a stress stress here without helping the addition of the other but by holding it in the center I will do it well Now the upper part of the neck is ready I continue to discover to show you it for the first time Now we work on the base of the pan. I'm going to use a little bit of it, you can add more and more, but I don't want to do anything too much. After you have used all your hands, I'm kidding, if you have used it, I can't talk about it, because it was a request, so I can't use it, because it's not good. Anyway, I can put it in the jar.

Metafísica al alcance de todos el libro de Saint Germain que es un libro de oro que es un libro agreso y también se le conoce como los discursos del yo soy ¿te acuerdas? y hay una de alquimia por si hoy tendríamos eso que no es nada más trasmutar plomo en oro no la transmutación del plomo corporal en un oro espiritual el tema de hoy es cómo la mecánica cuántica a través de la mente genera milagros, le quito el ego que son los milagros verdaderos de la vida y cómo yo puedo a través de mis decisiones poder cambiar este universo local. ¿Se acuerdan que antes la física clásica decía todo en el universo tiene ciertas características pero son inmutables? Ahora la física moderna o la física cuántica dice el observador cambia todo ¿estás de acuerdo? Yo observado de una partícula dejo de ver de todo milagro que podamos tener en la tierra. La mente nos lleva a la becadencia, a la tumba, al cáncer o a la salvación o a la liberación, depende de lo que quiera. La metafísica con la verdadera decreto y oraciones utiliza logeas, maestros ascendidos, jueces espirituales, jerarquía de ángeles, regentes planetarios que sería Sanat Humara, Gautama Buddha, por si quieren saber algunos nombres raros, y entra uno en un estado de nirvana Dicen los budistas que es cuando entonces es el samadhi, que es un estado de temporalidad, que es lo que le llamaban en el programa anterior Mercadá, un estado de superioridad. En ese momento entra uno en un estado del cual tiempo-espacio convergen, la mente se unifica, pide uno algo y se va a dar. Por eso decía a Cristo que podríamos hacer grandes cosas si tuviéramos fe, como un grano de mostaza. Entonces lo que hace la metafísica es que con palabras como en el libro de los condenados de Juan Chef Honimence, his maestro era Foxtrot, escrito en 19th century, a book de los Condenados de los Condenados de Juan de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de la XIXth century, que he was a book of the Condenados de los Condenados de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Covenavires de los Coven Esto es para entender que la metafísica es como una que hacer humano es hacer plegarias, jaculatorias, oraciones, visualizaciones y yo le he dicho siempre en la mañana cuando dices Dios mío agradezco olvido perdón trasiendo y me libero. El momento de hacerlo a la mansella la tercera debemos no imitar con una música tranquila o algo del fines o etcétera barroco con si a me esto gregoriano o New Age algo de la nueva para estar en un estado superior y la metafísica lo único que hace es que nuestras fibras nerviosas, la parte del sistema nervioso se acompasa, se equilibra, entras en un estado superior, luego meditas, entras en lo que le llaman nirvana o el estado místico o búdico o álmico o tiene varios nombres y finalmente lo que hace la metafísica es encontrarnos a un ser superior. Esta metafísica ahora actualmente ya se llama cuántica ¿Qué es el tipo de la energía que se puede hacer? para que la persona se deshoble, viaje y eso a ubicuidad estar en diferentes lugares te permite rebasar las fronteras de la luz y de la energía para viajar y eso se le conoce como un estado milbánico por eso la hora de cádica cuántica dice que si nosotros viajáramos más allá o 10 veces más allá de la velocidad de la luz ¿cuánto es eso? 3 millones de kilómetros por segundo no 300 mil de ser cuerpo, de conversar en energía y después de la energía en un campo fotónico plástico. Esto significaría que en diferentes lugares podríamos estar lo que hace Dios, ¿verdad? ¿Qué cuerpo Robert te alcanzaría para poder conocer a todos los seres de una galaxia imposible? Entonces, te desdoblas, eres luz, energía y esos diferentes lugares al mismo tiempo los absorbes. Un cuerpo físico no daría tiempo ni la mente lo entendería. Eso, ¿sabes dónde se habla mucho? el libro de urante que por cierto viene gratis en estas máquinas de tabletas, buscan el libro de urante y tiene más de 2500 hojas gratuitas eso es la metáfisica. Eso son clases que doy el curso Seminar y si demás, victorsegarra0114arobajimeil.com o al doble 564281 porque hay este material en los códigos, en las agendas, en mis clases y hay información muy interesante para todos ustedes. No hay más tiempo, quedó el océndigo. Bye.","How does the producer scream? Those screams of, oh! So what does quantum mechanics mean? Then it's metaphysics. Whose daughter? Obviously metaphysics is pre-method, mechanics was after. So if you remember there, the 2007, which was fashionable, the book of secrets, the book of secrets, which was the way to be able to reach a state of full happiness. Another technique similar to and that after the quantum mechanics it started with coninendes there are books that I recommend very good, which are called 4 in 1, remember? Metaphysics to the reach of all the books of Saint Germain, which is a book of gold, which is an aggressive book and it is also known as the discourses of the I am, remember? and there is an alchemy, well, in case we talk about that one day, which is not just transmuting the minor feather, no, the transmutation of the body feather in a spiritual gold, The question is how the quantum mechanics through the mind generates miracles, removes the ego, which are the true miracles of life and how I can, through my decisions, be able to change this local universe. Remember that before the classical physics, it said, everything in the universe has certain characteristics, but they are immutable. Now modern physics or quantum physics says, the observer changes everything, you remember. I observe, I see a particle, I stop seeing it, The mind can be a particle, it can be observed again, it becomes a wave, in a photon or light. And then, they have made experiments on how they cross the clouds of the cloud. The observer sees them, all of them enter the particles, they pass through the position and finally, they stop observing them and behave again as normal particles. The mind takes us to the decay, the tomb, the cancer, or salvation or liberation, depending on what you want. The metaphysics with true decrees and prayers uses logics, master ascended spiritual questions, Gerard, who is Angel, is a planetary agent who would be Sanatumara Gautama Buddha, if you want to know some strange names, and enters one in a state of Nirvana, The Buddhists say that Samadhi is a state of temporality, which is what they called in the previous market a state of superiority. At that moment, one enters a state of which time, space, converges, the mind unifies, asks for something and it will give. That's why Christ said that we could do great things if we had faith, like a grain of mustard. by Chef Honi Menz, his master was Foxtrot, written in the 19th century books. He talks a lot about a book of the condemned, remember Robert Millar, who called it the book of the condemned, which was in the 70s, and who talked a lot about Rodolfo Benavides, he wrote a lot about when men talk about the Tiemblas stones, dramatic secrets of the Great Pyramid, the malice of the black gold, and raising the curtain, including others. This is to understand that metaphysics is like a human being. It is to make plegatory, ejaculatory, orations, visualizations. And I have always told you, in the morning, when you say, my God, I thank you, forgive me, I am sorry, I am being betrayed and I am free. The moment of doing it, at the third and the fourth, I must imitate a music that is very quiet, or a baroque, or something of the finesse, or something of the New Age, to be in a higher state and the only thing that makes our nervous fibers the part of the nervous system is passed on, it is balanced, you enter a higher state then you meditate, you enter what they call nirvana or mystical or boudic or almico or it has several names and finally what makes metaphysics is to find ourselves a higher being this metaphysics is now currently called quantum I insist you to discover that the higher being could be living parallel lives, parallel worlds. You have heard the term parallel lands or worlds. I'm going to give you an example. Jaime, you have a crystal, right? A mirror. You throw a laser and the laser can be in two places at the same time. Your particle of energy is reflected and you are of course Robert, that you are the carrier of God and in two different points You can transcend with your mind and be a multidimensional being without having to leave your physical body. And that is what we call the Don de Ugui Cuida. Remember the father of Piyon, Peter the Chinese, the father of Stigmatizado. Look, this is Reni. You were here, you were seen here and you saw him in different places and you were not hallucinated and you saw him in his astral body. That is, in a mystical and urban state. And the metaphysics teaches you to be in a altered state so that the person can travel and to be in different places allows you to pass the lights and energy barriers to travel and that is known as a state in the urban world. That's why the time of the KCK says that if we travel more or ten times beyond the speed of light, how much is that? 3 million kilometers per second, no? 300,000? and then you become an energy and then you become an energy in a plastic photonic field. This means that in different places we could be what God does, right? What body would Robert reach to be able to know all beings of an impossible galaxy? So you disdouble yourself, you are light, energy and in those different places at the same time you absorb them. A physical body would not give time, nor would the mind understand it. That, knowing where it is spoken a lot, The grant book, which is free in these tablet machines, is looking for the grant book and has more than 2500 free pages. That's the metaphysics. Well, that's all the classes I have left, seminars and more.

Now some products will be displayed on the packaging to show their own carbon footprint. It is the so-called carbon fiber. However, the current law does not have strong will. So the domestic application of carbon fiber products is currently only 77. The LED light is 4kg lighter than the normal speed light. We will borrow the carbon fiber from the gas station. We can know that we can make a part more environmentally friendly. Although carbon fiber is included in the carbon fiber, it is not all products are environmentally friendly. This is a carbon fiber with 180g of carbon fiber. In the future, if there are more products to expose their carbon emissions, it can be compared to real low carbon products. The comparison is very important because if we say there is no accurate point, how do we know how much should be cut? Just like if we want to cut fat, we have to know how heavy it is. Currently, the carbon standard of the domestic industry is only 77, and 42 are drinks and food. The environmentalists also said that the carbon standard products and environmental products are not necessarily on the list. But the government still encourages manufacturers to expose the carbon emissions. and let themselves be tested to make a more clear, test-based promise. Remember to watch the Taiwan news."

Yeoman's original properties in North Richmond on the NW outskirts of Sydney, where in the 1940's and 50's he developed the 'Keyline System', is under threat from developers wanting to fill in the dams and over time place 2000 medium density homes on the property. They have put in a DA for a retirement village of 300 houses for a start and it had almost been passed by Richmond Council when the locals began to understand the significance of the site, question the DA and take some action.    A public meeting was organised on the 27th February 2009 in North Richmond and this video has come from that meeting and preliminary meeting with Ken Yeomans (younger son of P.A.) Prof. Stuart Hill, and Dr. Les Spencer. The video focuses on the Keyline System, however Part 2 (coming soon) will look at the remaining inadequacies of the DA, such as traffic congestion, emergency response, access issues, etc, and which doesn't even address the environmental factors such as flooding and fires when the dams are taken away (which the Keyline System addresses in a whole system approach).

Like how on earth is this going to happen? And then driving past it as I do nearly every day, I'm like, I can't picture it, I'm sorry, it's not... you can't picture it, you can't. It just goes to a whole lot of bare dirt and all the level blocks and then the bitumen goes in and then the houses go up. And they're all on water restrictions. We've been on a huge learning curve over the past few weeks and I've always admired I had no idea how this place worked. for the area. If Katerinburg can say we don't want a McDonald's, well then we can say we don't want medium density housing or it's not suitable for this particular area. Urban sprawl? Yeah. Urban sprawl to take over this area. And that's where we just got to get together and say, just enough's enough. My name is Marie Bowyer, I'm part of this committee. Lana Izzie and myself were alluded to the issue the year and a half ago now at least. We believe that it's actually been going on for longer than that. At the time we'll raise some concerns in the local We were called mad and liars at the time. We carried on scratching and people started coming out of the woodwork and momentum built up and we started feeling this needed further investigation. And then we had so more and more information came to surface so we then needed to come bring it to the community and ask the community what they wanted us to do. And on our first meeting, public meeting, we let the community know The community voted in this committee and asked us to do more research, put in a submission on behalf of the community, which we did and report back. In doing so we discovered a Pandora's box and it really was quite incredible what we did find. We touched the tip of the iceberg tonight really on the information. The most significant of course, been the key line system of dams, how unique they were and what we can do to preserve that. is one of the most significant sites in Australia and half of us, or sorry, more than half of us, me included, had no damn idea. to the leaders in the world at that time. One of those was Lady Eve Balfour in England who happened to be a friend of mine. And she traveled all over the world and looked at initiatives that people had taken. And she said, you know, if you really want to see the most important thing that's ever been done in the world that's going to save us from these problems, you should go and see Pea Youngman's farm in North Richmond. You folks are living right now. next to somebody who probably I would say is more deserving of a Nobel Prize as an Australia than anybody else in Australia. What Pierre Yeomans did was to say, have you worked with that landscape so that you could design it so that it stayed fertile, that it didn't have fire, that it didn't run out of water, it couldn't flood, it conserved its biodiversity, it could be productive and feed the population. forever and ever. I'd ever seen it before. And so like that is something what what is it about an approach to engaging with the world that enables you to see what no one else in human history had seen before. And if that is a way of looking boy I would like to know more about that because there's more things to look at than that little spot there. The Owens Key Lone System is based on treating water as an asset and designing the landscape to capture and store the water in the most efficient places. Most efficient is in the soil. Loosening the soil helps achieve that. The next most economical place is in on-farm irrigation dams, which is what you've got here. And you look at the climate that you've got and you look at the land shape and within the context of the land shape that's the borders that you're operating with inside there. The next thing that you plan is the bulk water. What happens with the storm runoff? What can be done with that? After the water is planned, and so you've got that here, you've got the interconnecting channels, the water storages in the most efficient places, and the water reticulation system that's in place. So you've got feeder channels that bring the water into the dams or connect the dams, and then you've got distribution lines or distribution channels going out from that. Then you plan the road system. You tuck it in underneath the channel so that you don't need to, as I mentioned before, they're protected, or up the middles of the ridges. Then you know other trees that are in the road are doing this. So then you plan the trees. Where the trees should go following that. So that's where you end up with your contour tree strips and ridge line tree strips. So you've got your roads then into your trees and then the subdivisional side of it whether it's for fences for farm paddocks or whether it's urban subdivision that just logically fits into those landscapes. And it's conglomerated too because you get an increase increased runoff from the roofs and the roads of those areas. And that runoff resupplies the dam, which resupplies the community with the water that it needs. So the whole thing becomes you just hardly need to tap onto the main water supplies. The development has come in on the bottom part of the property. Max's home is just about here at the foot of this dam. That dam has already been taken out. It's held about 80 thousand kilowatts of water. This next dam, which is the one that's still in place all over the road runs right up and just stops at the foot of the dam and I've seen some plans basically to put a roundabout and wipe that particular water storage out. That dam is filled by the overflow from this dam and it is filled from the overflow from this one and it's filled from the overflow from that one and it's sped by a diversion of Red Bank Creek right up where there's a It's the first fully sustainable agricultural systems entirely developed here in Australia by my late father. Bought the first properties in about 1944. They were sold to probate in 1964. So what we're looking at is, in the 80s, 90s, 40 years and it still looks fabulous. Because the landscape looks good because the biological fertility of the soil was built up using key-line techniques. Look at it in terms of capital. It's the only landscape system that builds landscape capital to the maximum amount. And I think it needs to be preserved and further developed. And it would be an absolute tragedy if this site was ever lost. It should be available for the whole world because this is what we've got to learn how to do. It's not learn how to solve problems in landscapes, but how to design landscapes so that they don't have problems. young ones did this more than anybody has ever done in the whole world. What's already been calculated is if we did this on the land that we could do it in Australia, we would actually capture more carbon than we're releasing from all forms in the whole of the country. And so we could be a net carbon capturing country as opposed to a massive carbon wasting country. So that's incredibly important. And then if you add on to that, the costs that you save from not having to deal with fires, with biodiversity conservation, with flooding, with trying to keep landscapes fertile with artificial inputs. Those costs are phenomenal and if you can do that by designing a system that works, which is what Yeomans did, you save all those costs.","When word got out that this developer had bought the land and spent all this money on it, the radars went up.

So this one's loose. So you take off the tuner that's loose and you take the needle nose and you crimp the flanges tightly together because they tend to get separated. Now what you do then is take the tuner onto a hard surface, take a little punch and carefully Take your punch, line it up over the flange, holding it firmly and holding the tuner down, and push the flange down. That retentions the tuner and no more wiggle, and it's tight, and it's not slipping. So you need to make yourself a French Shield out of cardboard that looks like this, or get one from Stuart McDonald. Very important when you polish. your frets. Then you want 400 steel wool and put into a little wad. Take your fret shield and I extend the stock fret shield with tape so it really protects the whole guitar while you're doing your work. Hold the steel wool firmly, hold the support the back of the neck as always when working on the guitar, and polish the frets in a vigorous motion about 10 times and you'll get a nice shine. So before you get to the upper frets, take a post-it and put it up against the fingerboard and this will protect the finish from overrun of the steel wool. So then keep stroking till you get off the oxidation. For final fret polish, I prefer the EWS polish cloths and then I put it around a piece of hard foam so I can work with it. Then you basically take your fret shield again and put it down and take the polish pad and it polishes the fret into a beautiful mirror like patina which is what you want. Put the oil on sparingly and just put it on. Let it sit for like a minute and then take your cloth and work it parallel to the frets. So you're working the oil into the wood. If your finger board is dirty and it has a bunch of funk on it, you'll need to scrape that off with either a razor blade or use some napta to clean it off. Don't oil over funky dirty finger boards and put that into the board. That's a no-no. I like to use Ernie Ball strings. They're my preferred strings as they sound great last longer. Take your bridge, put it in the proper direction. Take your string, And I generally put all the strings through before I string it. I don't put one string through and then string it up. I just put them all through. And this is just the way it's done. Make sure the hole is parallel to the knot. Then take your string and put it through the hole. Now if you're using grovers, you're going to want like three fingers. If you're using clusins which have shorter shafts, pull the string in and you want like two fingers. The reason why is you only want two wraps on the low strings and three to four on the treble strings. And on the grovers you want like three to four on the low strings and like three to four or five on the treble strings. Now there's different techniques about locking the string on the lower strings and a lot of guys lock them and I personally think that you don't need to because if you put it on properly and tight enough it holds. And I think the locking dulls the high end of the string if you don't do it properly. So I prefer to put it through, crimp it up so it's at a right angle, take your string winder and then put your finger like that. So the forefinger is pushing down and the other one's pushing up, kind of like a pulley. And then wrap your string and you always wrap your string down and get it tight. And it makes a difference in the sound. Now, the technique of locking the string, if you prefer to lock your lower strings, is as follows. When you lock it, you know, you pull the string back underneath the string, like so, and then I use a tool, usually when I'm doing this, to hold onto it tight and you pull it back like so. We're on the trouble side now. We're doing the G. Three to four fingers on the G. We're going to lock this puppy so you bring it under like so. So you'll pick the little string, you put it under, take your tool and pull it tight. So I'm pulling on the needles and I'm pulling on the other string and then I'm taking this back and locking it. All right. Still have tension on this string. never letting go of the tension. Take my little screwdriver, put my finger down like that like a pulley and wrap downwards tightly so that I have a nice even wrap.","So check your tuners for looseness and they'll wobble and wiggle.

Hold the steel wool firmly, hold the support the back of the neck as always when working on the guitar, and polish the frets in a vigorous motion about 10 times and you'll get a nice shine. So before you get to the upper frets, take a post-it and put it up against the fingerboard and this will protect the finish from overrun of the steel wool. So then keep stroking till you get off the oxidation. For final fret polish, I prefer the EWS polish cloths and then I put it around a piece of hard foam so I can work with it. Then you basically take your fret shield again and put it down and take the polish pad and it polishes the fret into a beautiful mirror like patina which is what you want. Put the oil on sparingly and just put it on. Let it sit for like a minute and then take your cloth and work it parallel to the frets. So you're working the oil into the wood. If your finger board is dirty and it has a bunch of funk on it, you'll need to scrape that off with either a razor blade or use some napta to clean it off. Don't oil over funky dirty finger boards and put that into the board. That's a no-no. I like to use Ernie Ball strings. They're my preferred strings as they sound great last longer. Take your bridge, put it in the proper direction. Take your string, And I generally put all the strings through before I string it. I don't put one string through and then string it up. I just put them all through. And this is just the way it's done. Make sure the hole is parallel to the knot. Then take your string and put it through the hole. Now if you're using grovers, you're going to want like three fingers. If you're using clusins which have shorter shafts, pull the string in and you want like two fingers. The reason why is you only want two wraps on the low strings and three to four on the treble strings. And on the grovers you want like three to four on the low strings and like three to four or five on the treble strings. Now there's different techniques about locking the string on the lower strings and a lot of guys lock them and I personally think that you don't need to because if you put it on properly and tight enough it holds and I think the locking dulls the high end of the string if you don't do it properly. So I prefer to put it through, crimp it up so it's at the right angle, take your string winder and then put your finger like that. So the forefinger is pushing down and the other one's pushing up, kind of like a pulley and then wrap your string and you always wrap your string down and get it tight. And it makes a difference in the sound. Now, the technique of locking the string, if you prefer to lock your lower strings, is as follows. When you lock it, you know, you pull the string back underneath the string, like so. And then I use a tool, usually when I'm doing this, to hold onto it tight. And you pull it back like so. We're on the trouble side now. We're doing the G. Three to four fingers on the G. We're going to lock this puppy so you bring it under like so. So you'll pick the little string, you put it under, take your tool and pull it tight. So I'm pulling on the needles and I'm pulling on the other string and then I'm taking this back and locking it. All right. Still have tension on this string. never letting go of the tension. Take my little screwdriver, put my finger down like that, like a pulley, and wrap downwards tightly so that I have a nice, even wrap."

Esse homem que veio lá dos Guarás, eu me permito dizer ao Dias Durán que eu conheci muitos Guarás, o famoso Clube dos Guarás. Talvez o Dias Durán tenha namorado muito lá. Hoje ele está aqui há mais de 40 anos em São Paulo. Me encontrei também, Júnior, com outros mais jovens. Chegou uma aqui agora, Júnior, no braço de uma mãe que vinha lá do Trici. Então aqui, eu inicio assim dizendo que estamos extremos na nossa direita, um cidadão, um trabalhador que veio há 40 anos e ao lado dele, um recém-nascido aqui em São Paulo, como prova de que o nosso evento foi um sucesso. sucesso no sentido de integrarmos os amigos que vieram de Tauá por falta de oportunidade no Tauá. O evento junho, para mim, foi um sucesso. Tenho certeza que para você também, que é um rapaz atuante, chegou aqui com humildade, trabalhando no restaurante, ligação, e hoje está concluindo sua faculdade.

This man from Guarás, I'm allowed to say that I've met many of them. The famous club of Guarás. Maybe Dias Duran has been in love with him for a long time. He's here in São Paulo for over 40 years. I also met Junio, with other younger people. One arrived here now, Junio, in the arms of a mother who came from the Trisí. So here I started by saying that we are at the extremes. On our right, a citizen, a worker, who came 40 years ago, and next to him, a newborn here in São Paulo, as proof that our event was a success. Success in the sense of integrating the friends who came from Tauá due to the opportunity in Tauá. The June event for me was a success. I'm sure that for you too, who is an active boy, came here with humility, working in a restaurant, in Gasson and today is the end of your college. And I guarantee you that you will be lawyer in Tauá. I guarantee you that your office is already waiting for you in Tauá. I would like to thank everyone who is here, Dias Durant as well, and to say that the party is being a success, and that in a little while we will be getting some more friends, and we will give another break to the people who are here to serve, to the party, and to taste the things that Nordeste has.

Tak, to jest moja kopuła, troszkę się zmieniła Otóż mamy tutaj las, tu mamy las, tam mamy las i tam mamy las No tak, ostatnio troszkę się bawiłem tutaj z moją kopułą No i jak widzicie, troszkę tych zmian jest Mamy tutaj bigon block Trewnianą podłogę, którą... No takie alejki w sumie, które prowadzą do poszczególnych Pomieszczeń jak... Anielski ogrody i... I Cyta de la Vybrańca. Dokładnie. Dlaczego tak to nazwałem? A no dlatego, że jest to Cyta de la swoją ebliskość ma. No i na dodatek Vybrańca, tak, to wszystko miała być świątynia... ...Pohatera, który pokonął Smoka. Więc... Możecie się domyśleć dlaczego. Tak, słuchajcie. Szczerze mówiąc na dzisiejszy odcinek nie miałem planu za bardzo. Jednak postanowiłem, że zrobię już... tak troszkę mój... obmyślany że tak powiem sufit proszę bardzo co my tutaj mamy tu mamy wodę a tu mamy trójkąt z wełną niebiesko-zieloną tak gdyż aby stworzyć tą wełnę potrzebujemy zielony niebieski barwnik słuchajcie nad tym trójkątem męczyłem się około 5-6 godzin jeszcze przed odcinkiem 96 więc to jest cholernie trudne do zrobienia To jednak wymagało ode mnie około 40 minut pracy. Więc tak sobie paczę, paczę i wydaje mi się, że no cóż, troszkę pójdziemy na Latwiznę i zbudujemy te trójkąty, tak jak ten, tylko że na środku jeszcze zrobimy biały trójkąt. I myślę, że to wtedy będzie wyglądać epicko. Słuchajcie, no przedtemną jakieś 3-4 godz. zabawy z tym. Nie jest to projekt duży. film jak robiłem ten jeden twój kąt. No tak, więc jak widzieliście było tam full wszelkich no rusztowań z dirta. No i cóż, to będzie robione dokładnie tak samo. Jeszcze chcę tylko zobaczyć jak wyjdzie ten twój kąt w środku. No, dobra, w takim razie słuchajcie, nie chcę przydłużyć dzisiejszego odcinka. Całą kopułę sobie dzisiaj nie obejrzymy ani nie obejdziemy. Kilka rzeczy takich jak grodzie czy Dobra, Minecraft Xtreme Adventure 98, pusto. No tak, bo już to zabrałem. Miałem na celu wybudowania razem z wami na początku odcinka tamtego drugą ta, ale postanowiłem, że pokażę wam już go gotowego. Tutaj macie wszelkie itemy, które mi pozostały. Mamy tutaj lazuryt i wełnę, która składa się z zielonego i niebieskiego barwnika, która według mnie pasuje tam doskonale. No i cóż, drift na rusztowania. No i trzeba jakieś i to ma, co ja mogę sprintować? Aha, jestem głodny Jestem głodny, co by tu przamać? A wiecie co zjemy torta? A co? Taka okazja, zaraz koniec sezonu to sobie zjemy torta. Dobra, mogę już sprintować. Dziemy, to mamy, tutaj gdzieś mamy. O, narzędzie, poproszę po narzędzie. Potrzebujemy to, to ewentualnie kill of i diamentową opatę, to nam starczy. No i żelazę ewentualnie weźmiamy troszkę jakby nam niby wiecie, jakby nam niby brakło tych szczypcy całe. Leciemy, nie ma, oczywiście widzieliście mój magazyn, troszkę się zmienił. Tak wszystko znakowane, barwniki wełna, wełna się tam nie mieści, więc no. W ogóle skontowane mam tak dużo co, a no słuchajcie z mojej fabryki, zresztą także teraz macie film. No właśnie tak, więc zebieramy tą wełna. Aha, powiem wam, To jest praktycznie całe lazuryt. I tam na ścianie jeszcze. Tam jest też lazuryt. Praktycznie całe jest moje bazy. Więc zrobienie takiego jednego wymaga 9 lazuryt, aże więc... No wow. To jest cholernie drogi materiał. Może nie drogi ale... Nie no drogi, ten blog jest drogi. Ok. Bierzemy Derta. No i słuchajcie, no i lecę budować kolejne trójkąty. Au. Padać. Lecę budować kolejne trójkąty. No i zobaczymy się, jak to wszystko będzie już ukończone. Oj, kopuła nabrała kształtu, wam powiem. Tego widoku się właśnie spodziewałem, mówiąc w 1981 odcinku, że będziemy budować podziemne miasto. No i cóż, myślę, że wyszło zajebiście. Dobra, lecę zdokończyć sufit i kopuła będzie kompletna. I hej, załaz ponownie po skończonej pracy. Dokładnie. Widzicie? Tak wygląda moja kopuła. Razem z Sufitem i powiem wam, że kopuła jest kompletna. Mimo już kiedyś planowałem wybudować coś jeszcze tutaj. I tutaj jednak te plany szlak trafi. Czemu kurówek nie ma? No nic, nie wiem. Za daleko stoję. A stoję, stoję gdzieś tutaj. No dobra, słuchajcie, Sufit skończony. No i cóż, jak wyglądała praca? No mniej więcej tak. To wszystko zajęło mi około 4 godziny, więc to jest projekt taki powiem luzacki. Najgorsze praktycznie były te wszystkie, jak to nazwać, rusztowania, jednak troszkę już w tym praw, prawym mam. No i jakoś mi to gładko nawet całkiem poszło. No dobra, więc jak to wygląda z dołu, co? A co do materiałów? No troszkę mi brakuje jeszcze wełny po tym kolorze niebiesko zielonym, No wełnę, znalazłem sobie w bazie, chwileczkę skoczę, w bazie z sezonu czwartego. I jest, wylądowałem. Umyślałem, że nie przeżyję tego, odrzułem w to. Dobra, nie ważne. I jak stąd wygląda? Wow, epicko, naprawdę epicko. Czekajcie, mam pomysł. Tu jest środek, tak? Nie, Beko nie włączy się. Dobrze, nie włączy się. Okej, oto mi właśnie chodziło. Zobaczcie jaki efekt. To wygląda jak krzyż. Nie, naprawdę świetne. Dobra, przełączamy? No i cóż, powiem wam, że to byłoby na tyle w tym odcinku. Gdyż ten odcinek chciałbym troszkę odpocząć, tak? Ponieważ w kolejnym będziemy naprawdę nieźle harować, no i zbudujemy coś epickiego. Więc zapraszam was bardzo serdecznie na dwa kolejne odcinki, czyli to będzie odcinek 99 i 100. 100 coś będzie. Coś fajnego. Co naprawdę mi się bardzo podoba. i nawet sam oglądałem ten film z 6-7 razy więc tak odcinek setny jest już skończony zamknięte grudzie otwarte, no ładnie dobrze, w takim razie no cóż, taki ładny widoczkiem kończymy dzisiejszy odcinek a ja się z wami żegnam no i do usłyszenia w kolejnym tak w kolejnym odcinku, w którym będziemy budować smoka cześć i do usłyszenia, hej!","Hey, welcome to the last episode of the Minecraft Xtreme Adventures series. Exactly, I have a episode 98. And what is it? Yes, this is my dome. It has changed a bit. We have a forest here, here we have a forest, there we have a forest. And there we have a forest. Yes, the last one I played a bit with is my dome. And as you can see, there is a bit of change. We have a big block here. A wooden floor, which is kind of a alley. Which leads to individual The place where the English gardens are located. And the Citadel of the chosen one. Why did I call it that? Because it's the Citadel of its own nearness. And the choice of the chosen one was supposed to be the hero who defeated the dragon. So you can guess why. Well, to be honest, I didn't have a plan for today's episode. I'm a little bit confused about this outfit. Here we have water, and here we have a triangle with a blue sky and a green one. To create this sky we need a blue sky and a blue color. I've been tired for about 5-6 hours before episode 96. So it's really hard to do. But it took me about 40 minutes of work. So I'm going to pack my stuff and I think we'll go to Latvijsland and build these triangles. But we'll make a white triangle in the middle. And I think it'll look epic. Listen, I have 3-4 hours of fun with this. It's not a big project. I made this video when I was fat. So, as you saw, there were a lot of rust from dirt. And well, it will be done exactly the same. I just want to see how this twicant will go inside. Okay, in this case, I don't want to extend today's episode. The whole dome is not visible today, we will not go. A few things like a garden or There are notes with a letter, I'll explain in the episode with the 100th one. Yes, there was supposed to be a nice intro to this movie, but it wasn't, why? Because the intro was so epic that it will be the 100th episode. Okay, listen. So, we're building this episode from smoke, and in the 100th episode there will be an epic movie, so I invite you to watch the next one, because it will be working. Ok, Minecraft Extreme Adventure 98, empty. I had a goal to build a second one with you, but I decided to show it to you. Here you have all the items that I have left. Here we have a laser and a flame that consists of green and blue color. I'm hungry, what should I eat? I can eat cake. I can eat cake at the end of the season. I can already print. I need this, this, possibly a kill off, and a diamond shovel. This is almost the whole lazuret and there on the wall there is also a lazuret, almost the whole of my base. So, making such a one requires 9 lazuret, so... Wow! This is a damn expensive material, maybe not expensive, but... No, expensive, this blog is expensive. We take DERTA and listen, and I'm going to build another triangle. And we'll see how it all will be finished. Oh, the dome took shape, I'll tell you. I expected this view, speaking in the first episode of the 90s, to build a underground city. And I think it's awesome. Okay, I'm going to finish the ceiling and the dome will be complete. And hey, again. After the finished work. Exactly. See? This is how my dome looks like. Together with the ceiling and I will tell you that the dome is complete. Although I once planned to build something else here. And here, however, this plan of the path goes up. Why is there no cow? Well, nothing, I don't know. I'm standing far away. And I'm standing somewhere here. Well, okay, listen, the ceiling is finished. So, how does the work look like? Well, more or less like that. It took me about 4 hours to make it. So this is a luxury project. The worst were all the rust. But I have a little bit of it. And it went pretty well. So how does it look from the bottom? And what about the materials? I still need some wool. I found myself in the pool of season 4 I thought I wouldn't survive it, but I found myself in it. Ok, whatever. What does it look like? Wow, it's epic. Wait, I have an idea. It's a middle part, right? No, I'm not connecting. Ok, I'm not connecting. Ok, that's what I was talking about. Look at the effect. It looks like a cross. I think it would be great. Let's switch it on. I'll tell you that it would be enough in this episode, because I want to start this episode a little bit. Because we will be doing a good job in the next episode, and we will build something epic. So I invite you to watch two more episodes, which will be episode 99 and 100. I really like it. And I watched this movie myself 6-7 times So... Yes... The episode is over The closed garden is open, it's nice Ok, so... Well, the episode is over and I say goodbye to you And see you in the next episode Bye and see you in the next episode"

Porque justamente comparte la cuenta, otros discritos, los dos discritos vecinos y como saben, se están haciendo obras al respecto del Instituto de Roma de Escamola de la gente, que de alguna manera ha visto el insisto del gobierno. En este largo, queríamos saber el tipo de convenio al que convenio de colaboración, de la administración de los distritos, y también queríamos saber si se ha quedado precisamente desde la administración de los caras del sector, por una posibilidad cierta de los fondos que se nos ha hecho, podría producirse después de una cuidad acuerda, o no sé, una cuidad no pargó los usan, o la cuidad de los nombres que se pasó, del mundo, y su aspecto de carcaeros de distrito, de los cuatro distritos, y en algún distante, por el que como el Dígatero. Así que, esto te doy informe, si yo quiero, vaya con el Dígatero, con la contextual, donde podrías destacar lo que díganme, cuando lo daríamos, lo tenía hecho, hubiera tenido mucho más sentido, digamos, pero vamos a hacer este proyecto, un proyecto de organización, una propuesta completa, porque ahora nosotros conocemos la cual está naciendo, pero le dimos el informe, como con el comienzo, que lleguemos a la voz judicial del Poder Provincial Municipal y a estar y con el Poder Aceso. Así que necesitamos información gratis de eso para poder pero una vez más, sé que la otra vez me esté hablando del encabezamiento intrativo. No hay ninguna idea, exactamente no hay una idea, pero la verdad es como dijo, bien, me tiene que reivindicar muchas cosas a lo que dijo la consejera de los respecto a la ley humanita de la municipalidad. En su artículo 108 habla de las instituciones y derechos, las instituciones y la correlación donde está el No solo es una divulgación, el Piscun tivo municipal, el piso de la licencia y la palabra licencia, sino que es una obligación de la licencia. Y cuando nosotros hablamos de la intervención del cuerpo de liberativo, tiene que ver justamente por esto. A ver, yo puedo decir que es un mensaje administrativo, así como esta parte de la tiempo, es una derracción jurídica. Porque la intervención, como pasó la otra vez en el contrato, Nosotros que lo mismo calciamos varias veces, pero lo que más recuerda es el contrato de la coalición del residuo. Es justamente lo mismo. El ex-suprime la voluntad de el deliberativo y el que tiene que ver con la cosa pública. También tiene que ver muchas veces con plata o con firma, cosas que son muy importantes para nosotros. No es casual ni es una cosa virtual que el deliberativo tenga que intervenir en estas cosas. Nosotros necesitamos autorizarlo porque justamente es también difícil que ve el que usted hacía recién. El intendente municipal fue elegido por el voto popular para exercer el cargo que desarrolla con normalidad habitualmente. Esto tenemos que explicar, que es que explicar cualquier persona que no fue elegida para esto, en el caso de que el intendente pida licencia, va a estar en cabeza, el ejercicio de la función pública ejecutiva local. Entonces es muy importante, a partir de la naturalidad, no quería hablar, pero quería imaginar a la naturalista que tiene la intervención de los liberativos en esto, ¿no? ¿Con qué tiene que ver? que no tiene que ver con otra cosa. Y tiene que ver con evaluar, con estudiar, la licencia se solitica y se pone a consideración del cuerpo. Para el cuerpo el relativo puede estudiar si la viabilidad es la licencia. Porque a las manos se puede pedir licencia por cualquier cosa. También es licencia. Así que nada más que decir, porque ya se dijo mucho, no quiero sobreabundarse, lo que parece que tiene que ver con eso, con el respecto a la licencia de poderes, con el respeto al voto popular, con el respeto para los que nos pide que nos está creciendo. Sinceramente, la verdad es que pedimos, pedimos, la aprobación del expediente que plantea y una ratificación de una licencia que ya fue conjada, que ya fue crecida por quien descenda al cargo de intendente de este municipio, es una dolaración pública. Entonces, porque nosotros que estamos representando a los que ha pedido, quizás no es la naturaleza, ¿eh? La prensa es estudiar, estudiar el pedido de existencia, evaluarlo con para eso se pone a disposición del cuerpo liberativo de los fuertesales. Y no es un medio trámite, un medio trámite que se hace porque hay que hacerlo porque en algún lado dice. Eso también hay que tomarlo así. Hay que empezar con uno ley las cosas, con uno ley la ley. Hay que empezar a pensar, a pensar lo de un lado cuando lo escribió. El final estaba pensando eso justamente, que nosotros piamos secretario del departamento de Ejecutivo. Nosotros somos, porque además han y the most important, para eso se ponen a favoriton, para eso se pone a disposición, que el cuerpo de la posicionado, el cuerpo de la liberativo de los colomb que tiene la administración. La administración pública tiene dos cositas, tiene que ver con la formalidad. Es absolutamente informal para el administrado, para el destino, para que tenga más posibilidad de intervención en la vida pública, todo lo que es la presentación de todas las demandas, pero es absolutamente informal y vigida para quienes ejercen la sociedad pública, porque por la misma razón, porque estamos investidos del cargo para el señor, nos convocaron los dirigieron y por eso tiene que ser así, por respeto, por respeto al voto popular. Entonces, me parece que con estas cosas hay que cumplir muy importante que nosotros se estén debemos hacerlo. Quería bueno, como se planteó también, que empecemos a leer la ley con mayor disponibilidad y entender para que se aprobese. No, la verdad que está roto, es de derecha a fría, a carciar en algún lugar que para algunos como el chiste y para algunos que tienen convenientes según la posición que ocupa. Así que nada, no puede decir esto, desde lo jurídico es una de las totales de la acción y de los","The theme of the project is to see with the support of the development and we see that the development of the work is being done by the development team. and we also wanted to see if we were able to do it in a way that would be perfect for a certain kind of school that we could have in the district, then a school that could be a school that we could have in the district, then a school that could be a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that we could have in the district, then a school that So, this is very useful, if I want to go with the context of the project, I could have said it, if I had not done it, it would have been much more meaningful. We are going to do a project, a project of NACA with a complete proposal because we know the project, but we will talk about the topic, because we want the voice of the city, the municipal government, and the city of So, this is very useful information is very useful, if I want to be honest, if I want to go to go to the content with the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content I'm not here to give you any idea, but as I said, I have to tell you many things about what the Constitution of the United Nations of the Municipalities of the 18th century speaks of the rights and violations of the Constitution of the United Nations of the 18th century. We have a distribution of the municipal budget of the legal system and the legal system of the law, but it is a obligation of the legal system. And when we talk about the intervention of the deliberative body, we have to see this together. I can say that it is an administrative method, and with this part of the time it is a legal violation. Because the intervention happened the other time in the contract, We do the same thing several times, but what we remember the most is the contract of the receipt. It is the same thing. The receipt comes from the release date and the receipt comes from the public account. It also comes from the receipt with the money, with the film, which are very important for us. It is not a card or a receipt that the release date has to be here in these things. We need to authorize it because it is also the same thing that you see with the receipt. The municipal superintendent was elected by the popular vote to be the head of the development of the normalization of the law. We have to explain what a person who was not elected for this, in the case of the superintendent, they ask for a license to be in charge of the exercise of the public function, which is a local executive. So it is very important. In addition to the naturalism, I would like to talk about the naturalism that the intervention of the deliberative has in this, right? What does it have to do with it? because having a relationship with someone who doesn't like it or doesn't like it, it has to do with something else. You have to see with evaluation, with study, a single license and you can consider the body. For the body, the relative can study if the viability of that license, because the hand can pay for that license. It's also a violation. So, nothing more to say, because I already said a lot, I don't want to overthink it, but it seems that it has to do with that, with respect to the power division, with respect to the other popular, with respect to the other popular, to the ones who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to those who are watching us and to make it more accessible to the public. that the administration has. The public administration has two things. It has to do with formality. It is absolutely informal to the administration, to the destiny, so that it has more possibility of intervention in public life, all the good, the presentations of the demands, but it is absolutely informal and rigid for those who exercise public formality, because for the same reason, because we are investing in the charge to be called to the intelligence, and that is why it has to be like this, with respect to the popular vote. So, it seems that with these things we must fulfill very important things and we must do them. It would be good, as it was also thought, that we start to read the law and continue to understand and understand why it was so important, the truth is that it is corrupt, it is in fact here, in some places, that for some it is a crime and for some it is a crime according to the position that it occupies. So, I can't say this, since the legal case is a result of the admonition and the"

I was inspired to do a bit of a video post today after a comment that a reader left who I've met and she's an amazing woman. And it was a comment that she basically said, you know, I'd love to get that banding done, but it's not worth dying for. Let me, it really, maybe think of a few things and that I want to share with you. Way back when I first met with the professor, told me, he gave me my blood results and he spoke about my suitability for being a candidate to be banded. And I almost suggest that you go back and read that original post, I'll link to it down here at the moment. On that day, which was February 2, 2010, he gave me six to nine months to live, which was something that I didn't tell anybody. It took me a while to tell Scott. And then I forgot that I even told him and I said to him, I was reminding him the other day and he said, yeah, you did tell me. But I didn't even tell my parents that. A bit huge for me to take on board, let alone anybody else. All I wanted to do was just get down to business and make myself have a life after six to nine months. So six months would have been up in August and my nine months would have been up in October. So I'm pretty close to reaching that mark now. But I've just got to say this, sitting on the other side of the fence now, not entirely, but with nearly 30 kilos gone with my HBA1C coming back as 9, not 18, that's your three month diabetes test. It still shows poor control but man, it's better than the 27 I had originally. All of my results are coming back pretty bloody good and the only thing that I'm sort of lucking in at the moment is a little bit of iron and I know that's simply because I've been choosing not to eat meat or things like that lately so that's just through choice, not through anything else. So all I've got to say is for anyone that is worried about what it's going to do, I know the professor and the group at the avenue in Melbourne have been doing this since 1991. They've done thousands of patients. There has never been one fatality ever. I did have a friend who died and I always said it was from lap banding and I spoke to one of her family members when I was back in Broken Hill the other day who said, no, she was banded for years. It ended up being a complication from something to do with her lungs and a bit of scar tissue or something like that. Anyway, what I've got to say is, and this may be really, really harsh, but you're fat. If you are obese at the moment, you have a variety of shit that can go wrong that you could die of tomorrow. If you want to weigh your shit up and worried about getting surgery only for that reason that it might kill you, well, sure, possibly. I've spoken to that has had this done has said it is as unequivocally changed their life. There's been a handful that it hasn't worked for and I do question that I'll be honest with you. I'll say well really is it the band not working for you or is it you not working for the band and using it as the tool that it was supplied to you with. Are you going back for regular fills? Are you eating what you're supposed to be eating or are you drinking high high calorie liquids? There are so many variables but if you do what is really required from your surgeon within reason. And I just, I really question it and go, it's got to improve your life in some capacity, surely, as far as weight loss goes. Yeah, that's all I really got to say about this, but I was given six to nine months to live. I'm alive now and I'm feeling the best that I've felt in a very, very long time. And the optimism and the positiveness in my heart is because I know there's an end in sight and it wasn't like any of the other weight watchers or Jenny Craig or Coins or anything like that which is so restrictive but it was something that literally my brain was restricted with. This is my body, my body's not craving the things that I'm restricted from or yeah it really depends. It depends on your surgeon, I've got my best friend Meg, she's allowed to pretty much eat everything and anything and she's not as restricted as what I am but that's the way I choose because of my lifestyle. I know that I need sort of quite a strict regime and things like that, but some people have got quite a relaxed lifestyle, eat out a lot and they need a little less and you know, that's fine and it's still working for them. So if you're even thinking about getting this done and it's only that that's keeping you back, then think about all the other shit that can go wrong while you're still fat, while you spend another year waiting and plotting along and yo-yoing. again. Think about the damage that's doing to your body. I wouldn't worry too much about an operation that took sort of a little while to recover from but still if you don't kid yourself is what I'm trying to say. Don't think that you're not going to die in other ways because of that. But yeah anyway I know I'm probably going to push some buttons here but that's me. I've never been one to keep my mouth closed and if you don't like the opinions then maybe there's something in of you that you've got a question to, I don't know, I don't really care but I hope that somebody gets something out of this and makes a decision to change their life, whether it's through having surgery or not, it doesn't matter. If you need that to kickstart your life and know that you want to be a mother or you want to be around for your grandkids, then do something about it now because I wasted so much in my life not doing a damn thing. So anyway, what do you do? I don't know. I hope you're all well and And yeah, that's all I've got to say about that. Bye.","Hi everybody.

And the optimism and the positiveness in my heart is because I know there's an end in sight and it wasn't like any of the other weight watchers or Jenny Craig or Coins or anything like that which is so restrictive that it was something that literally my brain was restricted with. This is my body, my body's not craving the things that I'm restricted from. It really depends. It depends on your surgeon. I've got my best friend Meg, she's allowed to pretty much eat everything and anything and she's not as restricted as what I am but that's the way I choose because of my lifestyle. I know that I need sort of quite a strict regime and things like that, but some people have got quite a relaxed lifestyle, eat out a lot and they need a little less and you know, that's fine and it's still working for them. So if you're even thinking about getting this done and it's only that that's keeping you back, then think about all the other shit that can go wrong while you're still fat, while you spend another year waiting and plotting along and yo-yoing. again. Think about the damage that's doing to your body. I wouldn't worry too much about an operation that took sort of a little while to recover from but still if, yeah don't kid yourself is what I'm trying to say. Don't think that you're not going to die in other ways because of that but yeah anyway I know I'm probably going to push some buttons here but that's me. I've never been one to keep my mouth closed and if you don't like the opinions then maybe there's something in of you that you've got a question to, I don't know, I don't really care but I hope that somebody gets something out of this and makes a decision to change their life whether it's through having surgery or not, it doesn't matter. If you need that to kickstart your life and know that you want to be a mother or you want to be around for your grandkids then do something about it now because I wasted so much in my life not doing a damn thing. So anyway, what do you do? I don't know. I hope you're all well and And yeah, that's all I've got to say about that. Bye."

You know, listen to your music. It is without a doubt. You are spiritually gifted. And from your bio, I see that you are from a musical family. Yeah. Started young as early as four playing drums. Tell us a story of this allurement and passion that led you to your journey to where you are. I started playing the drums and then from there I ended up being a Mozart concerto and stuff like that. And then from the play of the piano because I went to the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. It's kind of like the fame, kind of a situation. And I really wanted to play drums for a living, but the piano was in the same way. I felt that was a good thing to do. And then we're talking about the piano. too many drummers in line to play. So then what I did was I sat on the Fender Road and then took some classes from the college. David Baker, you know how to play bebop. And I kind of, I fell in love with just playing piano because I figured I can grasp the entire, I can play the drums, I can play the piano but I can play them both on the piano because the violin is a melodic instrument so is the piano. And the drums are the percussive instrument, you know, so is the piano. So I said, you know what, I'm going to stick to this. It's about to take some more violin lessons, but that's just between me and you. Right. Okay, go ahead. So what happened after that? After you finished, you enrolled, you were in music magnet school in Los Angeles, right? Right. Yeah, I went to Hamilton Academy of Music in Los Angeles, which was sponsored by the Grammys. And then I also went to the Los Angeles County High School for the R. I went to Berkeley School of Music in Boston. I left a little bit early because I had to do the Thelonious Mon competition in Washington, DC, the second time. Thanksgiving, this is a true story. I had Thanksgiving turkey and I said, hey, mommy, daddy, I said, I think I can leave. I said, I wanted to have some more of the turkey. And then ironically at that time, Jerry Moss and her bauper signed me and I ended up going to the I got discovered by Jerry Moss. I was doing something I was subbing for a good friend of mine, Billy Childs, a keyboard player. I was accompanying a French harness, his name is Richard Todd in Los Angeles, and they had a function called Grammy in the schools. And I was a little bit under the weather so he couldn't make it so I ended up subbing for him and ironically in the audience At the music Academy Jerry Moss was sitting in the audience and we played my funny Valentine and Little period Wow, and I got a chance to talk to him and decided to set me up with a Eight album recording contract and that was what year 1989 you were That was 1989 and 92. So you were about 16 years old? Yeah, I was like 16, 17 years old. And you ended up making two records there with them? Yeah, that was two records before Polygram. Oh, okay.

The training lasted 16 hours, divided in two days, with the goal of improving the quality of the production. The course's objective is to be able to teach the producers in relation to the most adequate techniques for the management of the entire field. The course has been carried out in another edition. The rural producers need to have science on prevention and precaution of bacteria before the order.

Don't fool yourself who thinks this way. Before milk reaches the table of your house, all the equipment is passed on by a series of procedures. The procedures today are a little different from what was learned in the last years. Today we work with as little water as possible inside the garden, since water is a matter of dissemination and transportation of bacteria. We work with as little water as possible inside the garden. We start with the... We remove the hairs with the help of vellas or even with a sariq, of course, inside the recommended technique. Then we spray the first jattos. We use products that make the sepsia of this tea, which we call predip. Then we make the garden The Lord Cardoso has already done five courses and for him, all knowledge is valid. Everything that comes from food is good, you will learn, we already know, with more learning, more that's it, it's too much for us to work on. In addition to learning, the producers want to add values to the activity of the production of the products. that they develop. The course comes at a good time, bringing the economic growth.

For the presidential election and presidential election, three cases were mentioned in the book. There were the three cases in 2012, 2017 and 2017. In addition, the book was also pointed out that China had the final decision to power in the political development of the region. On 15th this month, the Hong Kong University of China held a forum about the six-page book. Liu Weiheng, Professor Wang Yongmin and Lee Wing-dae, Dr. Chen Jiaro were invited to the stage but there was no stage. Several guests were also evaluated by Lu Ping-su.

This is game 1 between Akraos and Valinor for tipsy 3000s 1v1 February Iron Man Ladder. And this game will be on chasm. They are both bombers. They're actually both steampunk bombers. Valinor going with two levelers at the open right here. And Akraos going with the typical moneymaker setup. Valinor putting down one dillo here to stop those incoming jackals. Valinor has runners and Akraos has Probes do not really attack at all. They have such low DPS and it's like that it's virtually nothing. And now, Akros going for the same outpost that Valinor decides to reinforce. Akros will be surprised. He does see Valinor and he does move his attack to the south outpost. Now Valinor is coming to respond and will take out those probes very quickly, but Akros goes straight for this level or he does take it down. Going for the moneymaker, Valinor does save it. Acros is just taking this last, does take that last moneymaker and that was, that is definitely worth the trip. Now Valinor is, they are both level 2. Valinor is level 2 probably because that leveler is down. But Valinor does bring that Seeker over and does thwart Acros and make some retreat back to his side of the map. And now Valinor just continuing to fill all of his sockets. Acros doing the same, queuing up a moneymaker. Valinor rebuilding his leveler and now the fight for mid is going to start. Valinor starting earlier than Akros, but Akros did not have to rebuild the money makers that Valinor did. Now Valinor with the Dillos spam here in mid, Akros doing the same thing, but Valinor is pushing harder and more aggressively getting them closer to that mid outpost. Akros does not have his Dillos close enough to actually... and Valinor does see this, he is shooting him up, but Valinor does take mid and has an artillery here to support his units to shoot at the other side of this chasm. Dillos that were under attack by Akroz right there. And Akroz does take out pretty much all the units sitting in that corner of Balanor. Balanor is trying to ferry whatever he can on the other side of this chasm, but because of all those units and Akroz's melee, he's not able to really put enough to finish off all those other units. And Akroz is still ferrying more units, including a lot of Dillos here that are in his queue to this front line of battle here. Almost goes down to all of those Seekers and Dillos so close there. And Akraos not stopping bringing all these Dillos, but Valinor with the Bombing and these Artillery shooting at the same time, these Dillos are not lasting very long. Now Valinor finishing these units off and there is nothing left for Akraos over there. Akraos respawning has two Seekers in queue, but there is just those two Artillery on the other side of Kazmar. Ripping up anything he puts right there. And that's really the only spot that he can put things that will effectively combat Valinor in this area. So really good placement of those artillery on Valinor and they are not getting contested at all by Akros. And Akros does not have any counter-artillery. And he does go down right there to Valinor. And now this is a very big opening for Valinor. Already level 4, whoa, level 4. No, no. Valinor is level 6 and he has grinders out on the field. Acros is only level 4 and he is going to go for the north outpost there on Valinor's side But it has a lot of infantry there and Valinor will probably see this very quickly No, he has not responded yet and Acros has free reign on attacking this outpost right now Valinor is responding right now and he will be able to take out at least one of those infantry The outpost does go neutral, but Acros is not able to get any of his infantry inside. He does take down a moneymaker there But Valinor is just continually pushing. He does have them going up to this outpost, Akraos' north outpost. And one is going for, actually one Dillo is going for the fort. And the rest are concentrated over here at Akraos' north outpost. And because of this grinder his units are going down very fast. Valinor coming up with a Seeker. There are two Seekers, two Dillos and one grinder here for Valinor. Way too much for acros right now and that will probably be able to be enough to take him to take this outpost Valinor faring another grinder another grinder in queue with three patches and acros has his force deal with this distraction over here for Valinor it's shooting from Valinor it's shooting at the Main Fortin that was enough time for Valinor to get a lot more units over here especially these grinders acros almost this outpost still has four bulbs up because there are things Our units, enemy units for the blue units to shoot, but it now is going straight down. Valinor is almost down. Valinor has almost been taken out. If he lifts off, Acros will take him down. But, and Acros does follow and take him out, but Acros also gets taken out in the process with, by those Seekers. Now Valinor will respawn first. Let's see where he goes with this. Sporting that fancy tournament cup that he just got via Fedcom's Mini-Turney. and this outpost is blue. There are 4 creeps here for acros but there is nothing else. There is absolutely nothing else over there. And acros right now is at a 42 to 80 upkeep disadvantage. And acros already calling pretty much calling a GG. He just wants this to end at this point. There are so many units over here at the north outpost on the green side. And acros bringing 2 dillos over here. Let's see if Valorant notices. Let's see if he can respond it. He does see it on his minimap, but I don't think he cares There are so many dillos over here for him that even if acros had free reign on the front door Valinor will still win this game now acros coming back to defend and Does have grinders in queue he will spam them or drop them these two grinders down here and he is doing bombing but Valinor bringing everything to the Everything that he has over here to the sport. He The acros is forced to deal with the front door units first Valinor has three seekers in queue Brings the grinder down and it looks like even though there are units shooting at the front door of Valinor acros there are too many units here There are too many blue units on this side and acros will Eventually this is kind of slow actually all those armadillos are dead all those armadillo went down to the grinder and Valinor is forced to come back and kill these Armadillo. But Akros is coming back and Valinor has not seen it yet. Akros is coming back, this is so close! If Akros is able to, and he is using Mantis Strike, Valinor puts two more on the front door. Who is gonna win? This is so close! It looks like Akros is almost dead and Valinor is coming back to respond, but he does get the victory. And Valinor takes the first game, such a close margin. Wow. Alright, stay tuned for game 2. That was Games R UI. See you next time.","Alright, here we go. This is game 1 between Akraos and Valinor for tipsy 3000s 1v1 February Iron Man Ladder.

Akros bringing down Seekers, he does not have the easy quick drop that Valinor does because he actually owns this outpost right now. The artillery here, and Valinor starts to put, uh, is already starting to ferry units to the other side of the chasm. Aggros has a lot of, also has a lot of units, and is starting to take out this, but he probably will not survive this. The Seeker is shooting at him. I think one artillery went down, but that Seeker did finish him off.

You want to market yourself in a way where you're positioned in hotspots all over the internet so you can get effective traffic that actually converts on the internet. List building is very vital. Internet marketing is all about building a list. you can't grow your list, you're not going to make a nice income online. The bigger list you have, the more money you're going to make. It's that simple. I've seen so many people fail in this industry and I want to help you by giving you a free 7 video course which is going to show you exactly what I'm doing to get highly targeted leads from Myspace and Facebook and YouTube so that you can then use on your own business to effectively change, grow your list, position yourself on the internet and effectively brand yourself so that you're getting more prospects and more leisure business.

They brand themselves so efficiently that people come back again and again even though their food doesn't taste all that great. Positioning is very important. You want to have your videos. You want to market yourself in a way where you're positioned in hotspots all over the internet so you can get effective traffic that actually converts on the internet. List building is very vital. Internet marketing is all about building a list. you can't grow your list, you're not going to make a nice income online. The bigger list you have, the more money you're going to make. It's that simple. I've seen so many people fail in this industry and I want to help you by giving you a free 7 video course which is going to show you exactly what I'm doing to get highly targeted least from Myspace and Facebook and YouTube so that you can then use on your own business to effectively change, grow your list, position yourself on the internet and effectively brand yourself so that you're getting more prospects and more leisure business. My name's Gavin Stevenson and you can get a hold of me at GavinStevenson.com or you can email me at ChaseMeMarketing at gmail.com or you can Skype me at GavinStevenson.com. I look forward to hearing from you. My name's Gavin Stevenson. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

On the other hand, the European Union decided to prepare for the next coup to restore the legal system of the coup d'etat, which was more than a few years ago, from the rest of the European Union in 2012, because it was not a good goal for the Ukrainian elections in the past. and the Ukrainian people were very upset about the fact that the Ukrainian people were not able to achieve their goals. and described the intention and goal of the group that was set in the end of the war as a result of the justice of the previous ball.

If we possess a kernel of truth but face questions about it, we feel compelled to find the answers in order to solve the mystery. It is no wonder that mystery novels and films remain popular and mysteries of science generate intense scrutiny. The Church presents a mystery for our consideration on the solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity. Because this one deals with the very nature of Almighty God. We accept that we will never understand it entirely until we see God as He is, face to face in heaven. Nevertheless, we can grasp some measure of the truth of the Trinity. Jesus tells the disciples that the Trinity of which He is a member No vast, but they cannot bear it. But He promises that the Holy Spirit will enlighten their minds and guide them to all truth. The truth is this. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, three persons in one divine nature of perfect love, living in perfect unity. Each of us has a share in the life of this divine community, responsibility to live our lives in a manner worthy of so great a gift. Unlike a novel, this mystery cannot be solved only with our powers of intellect and imagination, though we use these to understand the Trinity as best we can. The mystery of the Trinity invites us to love God as He loves us. Let us strive, therefore, each day to love God through the persons of the Trinity with all our minds and all our hearts, however imperfectly, until we may adore God perfectly, forever in heaven. May God bless you.","Dear friends, few things appeal as much to our natural curiosity as a mystery.

We accept that we will never understand it entirely until we see God as He is, face to face in heaven. Nevertheless, we can grasp some measure of the truth of the Trinity. Jesus tells the disciples that the Trinity of which He is a member No vast, but they cannot bear it. But He promises that the Holy Spirit will enlighten their minds and guide them to all truth. The truth is this. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, three persons in one divine nature of perfect love, living in perfect unity. Each of us has a share in the life of this divine community. responsibility to live our lives in a manner worthy of so great a gift. Unlike a novel, this mystery cannot be solved only with our powers of intellect and imagination, though we use these to understand the Trinity as best we can. The mystery of the Trinity invites us to love God as He loves us. Let us strive, therefore, each day to love God through the persons of the Trinity with all our minds and all our hearts. However imperfectly, until we may adore God perfectly forever in heaven, may God bless you."

Man übernachtet hier oben Frühstück, ist zusammen und man formt so bisschen die Gruppe dass sie sich findet und zusammen bleibt. Fliegen bedeutet aber nicht nur Spaß.

The advantage is that you can increase the number of strikes in the school days. If you fly every day, you can reach 3-5 times a week. In normal flight life it will be limited to the weekend. The flings are also served by comrades and the fun. You spend the night here, breakfast together and form the group. The flight means not only fun, but also a new view of what is below. In the end, however, everyone has their own movement to the plane or the sailor to get on. The 15-year-old Manuel Knoblauch had his first flight alone this week without a flight instructor in the sailing plane. And it won't be the last one. On the Messelberg in Donstorff, he will be true."

Для этого используйте отвертку с тонким стержнем или любой другой инструмент, который можно поддеть клавишу. Вставив отвертку под клавишу, не сильным движением подденьте ее и вытяните. Складывайте клавиши в стороне в таком же порядке, как они размещены на клавиатуре. Это облегчит обратную сборку. Со временем под клавишами собирается много мусора, которое и нужно удалить. Для этого используйте спиртовые салфетки. Поскольку подложка не содержит никаких критичных деталей, для ее очистки можете применять достаточно большой усилий. Наиболее удобный способ очистки – протирать подкладку сначала по горизонтали, затем по вертикали или наоборот. Это исключит появление случайных грязных участок.

После очистки больших клавиш аккуратно вставьте их на место, соблюдаю помянутую специфику их крепления. Проверьте, как они нажимаются. Для установки клавиши пробел воспользуйтесь отверткой, чтобы завести концы металлического плеча в соответствующие выступы на подложке.

It includes a keyboard cleaning. To do this, you need to pull them out of the socket and wipe them. You also need to clean the keyboard's underclad. To do this, use a screwdriver with a thin rod or any other tool that can be used to push the keyboard. By inserting the screwdriver under the keyboard, do not move too much, push it and pull it out. Fold the keys in the same order as they are placed on the keyboard. This will make the assembly easier. With the time, the keys are assembled with a lot of garbage that needs to be removed. For this, you use alcohol napkins. Since the substrate does not contain any critical details, you can use a large amount of effort for cleaning it. The most convenient way to clean is to wipe the base first horizontally, then vertically or vice versa. This will exclude the appearance of accidental dirty parts. For narrow areas, use a screwdriver, turning its end with a napkin. Now you can start cleaning the key. To do this, put a new napkin on the table and, taking the key in your hand, energyfully pat it on all sides of the napkin. Then install the key on its working place. Repeat the same operation with each key. When installing the key on the place, try to do it carefully, otherwise you can break the fixers. After cleaning the key, you can start cleaning the rest of the keys. the same specific mount. Check how they are pressed. To install the key, use a screwdriver to start the ends of the metal shoulder in the corresponding protrusion. If you do not install this key for the first time, analyze the situation and try again. After that, take a new alcohol napkin and go through all the keys and the upper part of the keyboard again. The keyboard profile is finished."

We have a special interview for you guys today in the studio. We have Steve Creamer. Thanks for coming with me. Come and meet with me, Steve. My pleasure. My pleasure. I know you have a busy schedule. It's really nice of you to take some time out to come and talk with us. There's been a lot of issues in the news today about Utahns not wanting a low-lover waste coming in and being stored here. And there's been some big headlines about Utahns. energy solutions, who is one of the world's largest stores of radioactive low level waste. And we know that you guys have been trying to push for legislation to pass so you guys can be able to store low level foreign nuclear waste. And we were wondering what you had to say about that. Well, you know, by the way, I really appreciate this opportunity to be here, Barnaby. But the issue that I have with it is there is a lot of concern with this. every day there's nobody that does not have an opinion with regards to this. But a lot of it is misguided in the sense that when people think of nuclear waste they think it's we're going to be bringing in from a nuclear power plant like Chernobyl and storing it here and then it's going to get the water and we're going to have three headed to fishes and things like that. But no, that's not what we're talking about bringing in. What we're talking about bringing in are gloves, surgical equipment, things to treat cancers, that kind of thing that we're going to be storing. The nuclear regulatory agency says that this is extremely low level waste and the risk of contamination or anything is extremely low. Do you feel it's safe to bring in this low level waste when other countries feel that it isn't and they do not accept foreign or low level waste? Yeah, I do think it's safe. And I think that the situation we have is unique. In the sense that we are a very large country, most countries aren't as big as us. Especially the country that Yes, countries, other countries don't, but the thing is too, other countries don't have the capabilities to store it as safely as we do. A lot of countries have problems in storing these type of things, but the measures and precautions that we take are second to none. We have an extremely safe track record. We have never had an incident, and we are going to continue to do so because as being part of the solution to us means to ensure that we can store these safely so that it benefits everybody. We don't want that to happen. This is like making my 32. That's a very good question, Bart. Nobody wants you taught to become a dumping ground. And what we're talking about is bringing in, not a ton, we're talking about 4% of our current capacity at our flight to Utah facility. It's all we're talking about bringing in and it's all we're going to bring in from other countries. I know that in the past there's been some speculation that No, no, where are they going to stop? If they get this, they're never going to stop. But that's not true. That's not true at all. We are promising the state of Utah 4% of our current capacity. So that's a very small percentage of how much we're going to actually bring in. And we're not going to bring in anymore. We do not want Utah to be noticed on dumping ground. I love Utah. I was born and raised in Utah. There's nothing in this world that I love more than my state. That's why we give back to the community with our charities. With the Energy Solutions Foundation, we help students go to college We study math and science. We care about this state and we do not want anyone to speculate and to think that we're some sort of dumping ground. Also, what would be the benefits of Utah and the citizens of Utah letting energy solutions come in here and let this be stored? Well, I'm so happy. We just made sure that because what we're proposing can really benefit the state. First of all, what we're doing is we are all about recycling. I'm recycled every day. I love to recycle because it helps the environment and so what we're talking about doing to the to the to the state is giving half of the profits that we're going to really expect to bring in from this from this waste from Italy half of the profits we're talking 1.5 billion dollars which money that's going to be used for schools for for for elementary K through 12 as well as higher education such as Weber State that their budget was just cut $12 million because the state of Utah faces a $1 billion shortfall this year. Where are they going to come up with that money? You can only cut so much before you have to start raising taxes but we can't afford to pay more taxes right now because everybody's losing their job up to raise. These are tough times. Right now is an exceptional opportunity for the state of Utah because we're going to donate a billion and a half dollars over the 10 years to the state of Utah. help generations to come because we're just donating this money and all we're asking is to just store a tiny little thing extremely safely, a tiny little amount of low-level waste in one of our facilities in a very very remote, desolate part of Utah. One last question. There's a city that's close by this facility and I was just wondering, would you feel comfortable living near or by your storage facility for this low-level nuclear waste? Absolutely. Absolutely. I wouldn't think twice about it. The measures that we take when we bury this material ensure that it will never ever get into the groundwater. Bunker busting bombs couldn't get this into the groundwater. We do not want anything. We do not want anybody to get hurt. I grew up in southern Utah. The downwinders from the nuclear testing that the government did in the 50s and 60s over in Nevada. Those that nuclear, the nuclear problems that we have down there. I see, I see firsthand that the problems that it has caused down there and I would never ever want that to happen to anyone else. The suffering that has taken place down there with cancer and everything should not happen and I promise you, I commit to you right now that that will never happen. The thousand year lifespan that this stuff has will never be able to get into the groundwater at all. That's good. I definitely can tell that you were concerned for the state of Utah and protecting the people that live here. We appreciate you coming in and here and spending some time and clarifying some things and we wish you the best of luck. My pleasure. It's been such a good opportunity to meet with you and I really hope people, my only hope is that people really understand that what we're trying to do will actually help you not hurt you.

We just don't know what to do with this whole thing called money. Well, I found out something about money. fun if you got some. Boy I tell you what it does weave its way into the tapestry of our lives and it does mess with us on just about every possible level. So we're glad you're here. I can promise you this we are going to have some fun as we talk about money. We're going to laugh, we're going to cry, I'm going to talk to you about relationships, I'm going to talk to you about your spiritual walk, your emotions and we're going to change the way we handle our lives around this subject of money as we go through this class together. It's absolutely imperative that you really stay plugged in. Now some of you have, you just didn't want to be here. You were drug here against your will. I know that because I was out in the parking lot and I saw several sets of heel prints on the way in. Some of you, Dave Ramsey, the name has become a cuss word in your house. Some of you, one lady I was doing a book signing a while back and she said, you know, I don't even know you and I don't like you. And some of you, that's you. I understand. I get that. We are going to have some fun and if that's you, I'm probably actually more on your team than on the team of that nerd that brought you. I'm a guy that's been there, done that, got the t-shirt. I grew up not rich. How many of you grew up not rich? When I got out of college and graduated from college, my wife and I got married. We were so broke we couldn't pay attention. We didn't know what we were going to do. When we graduated from college, our net worth was a half a box of no-dos. You know what I'm saying? And we got married and started off our lives, broke. How many of you, when you started off, started off basically broke. You know what I'm talking about? We ain't got money honey, but we got love. It's a good thing too because we ain't got no money. Well that's how we started out. And I started buying and selling real estate and I got rich. At least by a kid from Antioch Tennessee standards. I ended up with about four million dollars worth of real estate starting from nothing by the time I was 26 years old. However I had done some dumb things. Nothing immoral, nothing illegal or anything like that. I didn't steal from anybody. I didn't lie to anybody. I was just stupid. it. I borrowed too much money and our largest bank got sold to another bank and then word got out on the street that Dave was in trouble and another bank got sold to another bank and they started calling our notes and we spent the next two and a half years of our life losing everything we owned. We were sued, we were foreclosed on and finally with a brand new baby, a toddler and a marriage hanging on by a thread, we were bankrupt. I was a 28 year old, young, I And I started reading another guy named Ron Blue, met another man named Howard Dayton, and these men had been teaching biblical finance throughout North America. And I started learning from them and started applying those principles in our lives because we were so beat up we didn't know what to do. And see I had all these letters and licenses after my name that says I'm supposed to know something about money. I've got a finance degree and there I sat broke. Apparently something was wrong with my plan. And I needed a new one. You see, I do everything backwards. Most people meet God at the bottom. I met him on the way up.

Now I won't point him out, but one guy was pointing this way and he did a little cheerleading move. Everybody have a seat. The point is that this is the truth. That is north, that is the truth. And we live in a culture today where people think they can make up their own truth. You can't make up your own truth. There's a truth that's independent of you. And your feelings are often not true.

This is the truth. This is the truth. And to the extent that you are not lined up with your compass, you're in what's known as lost. And you're going to bring pain to your life, and you're going to bring shortage to your life, and you're going to bring problems to your life. I know I've lived that. So how you feel really doesn't matter. matter. And we have to remember that it's about choices. Personal finance is about 80% behavior. It's only about 20% head knowledge. That's why God chooses to work through money to change and transform us. For some of you, He's going to use this issue of money to heal your marriage. For some of you, He's going to use this issue of money to put discipline in your life in a place and in a way that you never dreamed you would see it. You're going to make different choices after having gone through this. It absolutely works. Financial Peace University began about 20 years ago. I started it with a bad suit and overhead projector. The typical family going through Financial Peace University pays off $5,300 in debt and saves $2,700. That's an $8,000 change in position is the typical person or the typical family going through this. And so if you pay a little bit for this course and you go through it and you get $8,000 change, I call that a bargain. I call that a goodbye. deal and you're definitely going to want to do that.

The most important thing is to have mercy on Allah for every Christian who is a reasonable and intelligent person. For everyone who wants to control his mind before he is forced to do something else without thinking. Every Christian who is reasonable and intelligent must answer these questions which I will ask him about through the verses of the Imam of Allah. How can a murderer be the God-given servant? Some of them said that he was pleased with what they did in him. So, they deserve the reward for doing this. Some of them said that he was a liar about who killed him and killed him. So, how can a God be the one who wants to kill him? We have Muslims who see that Jesus, peace be upon him, Those are the successors. Allah raised them to Him and did not harm them. Look at the rational questions for those who worship Christ, other than Allah. And how the iron body of him is formed and his bones are crushed And how his hands are able to defeat him And how the page of his page is long and he is lost And is the Christian return to a life? Or is it the Lord's reward? And the strange thing is that the Christians worship the wood which is made of wood They say that he is a slave in a grave. How can they worship the grave that is buried? And he was surprised to see a grave in the Lord's presence, and he was surprised to see a grave in his presence. There was a man from a month, who had a lot of sins, and he was surprised to see a small child, who was weak and had a lot of sins, and he ate, drank, and came back. We know that you must eat and drink. What would Jesus do in his birth? In his youth. He would not do what all humans do. How would he do this? All people will be asked.. On the Day of Resurrection.. they will be described by their Lord.. And what is the God who worships? Is there a God in this picture? Is there a God who speaks to all of them? Is there a God who kills and slays people? Is there a God who is born like people? And dies like people? And is he buried under the soil? The wisdom of the minds before you are taken away by others, Allah has guided you to his straight path"

Yes, you are. Simba brand manager, excellent. So we're going to ask him some questions about the new NNORTS that they're bringing out end of Nations. It looks amazing. We've had a bit of a play on it today. So first of all, the game sort of specs and everything. How many people play each side on the IK? So one of the things about End of Nations is it's very scalable. So you can have, it starts off with 1v1, 4v4, APA, All the way up until 28th year, the first of 28th. So this is one of the big things we're looking to do in the nation is having really mass scale strategies. So the first of 28th battles is going to be a lot about coordination. You know having someone coordinate lots of different teams. Everyone's going to be working, the team structure works in teams of four. So it's not going to be like 28 random people on the battlefield, people working their own units. Add a new level to the game. Yeah, exactly. It's pretty good. And the maps on the game, I've heard it's kind of territory based, where it's kind of people taking territory off each other. Is that how it works? That's the map. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, they're sort of like constantly, each side is constantly fighting the territory. And you also have the End of Nations faction, which is like a BBE faction, which we're also doing the same. So, you know, details are going to be released later on about how exactly that works for you. So how many factions are there in this? split into Spartan and Patriot. And for example, Spartan is all about heavy units, a lot of armor, a lot of heavy tanks, and Patriot is about support. So you have a lot of like anti-tank gunships, a lot of support abilities. So they complement each other in different ways. And then on the other faction, Shadow Revolution, they're more about stealth and speed. And again, you have some more sort of support faction and more of a heavy hitting faction. A lot of the gameplay is going to be about working together with the different sides. You can't do everything on one side. No. So it's that huge combination of stuff that's just going to make it every single game you play is always going to be so different. Yeah, exactly. And all about coordination and teamwork. So that's really the key thing. Learning how your teammates are playing, what units they're fielding, and then doing something to complement it. Is the game a buy and then you pay per month? Or is it a buy and then it's free? It's going to be free to play. So there's no work from payment, nothing to pay at the beginning. There's going to be microtransactions supported but more details are coming out further down the line. With a store kind of basis. Will that be purely cosmetic or is that going to influence any kind of... We're very cautious about avoiding pay to win. It's always very key. It's going to be a competitive game. Maybe to win by skill. There are cosmetic items, there are going to be other items as well, but nothing, we're making sure that a lot of the items are available through playing the game. So everyone has a shot at getting them? Yeah, you can't just buy one new batang and won't have that, no one else can get them. Exactly. You can customize all your vehicles and everything, can't you? That's the MMO side of it. Yeah, customization is going to be a big thing, like you said, it's the MMO level of it. You can customize units with individual mods. There's going to be leveling up as well. So each commander will level up and eventually you can assign new abilities in your tech tree. So each commander again is going to be unique. There's going to be specializations like one guy might want to say I want to focus on their units. One might want to say focus on every tank. You can respect but of course there's a constant ball of respect each time. So yeah, there's going to be a lot of positive things. There's so much stuff that you can change. I can't even comprehend how different is it going to be, how dynamic it sounds. Wolf, you can pay per month, maybe is that coming in and getting a cover of a previous membership? We haven't decided yet, we're going to be releasing details on exactly what options a player has. We're looking into different options at the moment. And I guess three players, would they have any restrictions to their accounts? It's going to be here in Alfa now. You guys being RTS experts, it's great to get your opinion on this. Hopefully all the guys in your community can enjoy it again. I hope they will. Thank you very much. Give me the interview. Excellent, good luck with everything. Thank you.","Hi, it's Vonix from Archon Esports here with Dominic Y from the end of Nations brand manager, aren't you? Yes, you're brand manager. Simba brand manager, excellent.

So it was I mean that's always been a priority you that's part of your Growing up you know about giving to the church. So that was always something that was a given like I said, they just always saved I don't know that and made wise decisions. My father only ever bought a car if he could pay cash for it. And if we didn't have the money for it, we just didn't have it. That's the way it went. I was kind of different when I first got married. She was a saver and I was a spender. So we had totally different lifestyles to start out with. So when, and I have a little way of doing it on my little thing and I write them all down and when they're due and when they're, how much they are and which paycheck it can come out of and so I've kind of got the month planned and that's just the way it's always been. And it's when we have a paycheck, that's when we do things. When I write the bills, I write the church check and then we go home. I let him know if there's not enough money and we need to figure out where, you know, what bill we can weigh down, what bill we can do this with, how much we need to take out of savings, whatever. So it was always nice to know, even though I was never really too involved with it, I kind of had an idea I could see where we were. So it was nice to always be sort of grounded, if you want to say, in where we were. But if we were making a major purchase, or anything like that, that we always discussed that and figured out what we could afford for a car payment. But he's always, I came into the marriage with it doesn't have to be new, it used as okay, this isn't so, we don't have to have the top of the line and he always kinda wanted the top of the line and I can follow that lead really well. know, it's worked out. We still don't do it if we can't afford it. But um, yeah, I always liked the best. So I had the same attitude. You get the best. And we kind of follow that now on the same line. We try to do what we think is the best or get what we think is the best. So it lasts longer. But I've calmed down a lot and spending a little bit more rational now than I ever used to be. But if it did take a while, there was never, you know, just simple, easy. There was a lot of discussions and sometimes there were more than discussions, but it was a different background. I didn't see it as a problem. Luckily it didn't get out of control. It was spending on motorcycles. Always those. Like I said, I was raised that way. That's just part of your Christian life, is giving to the church. It didn't mean anything to me to tithe. And it wasn't until actually Ma and Jen and Ruth kind of all talked about it and I started getting an understanding of it, but still I wasn't paying the bills to make much sense to me or much too much of a concern to me. But the more I started, Jen and Ma are talking to me more and more, they kind of got an idea going on. So that's why I started reading the Bible and I finally started seeing what it was all about. And found out about first fruits and it kind of made sense and so that's where we kind of got a discussion from that point on about Tiding should be off what we make totally now. Of course fellow about the last 10 years in the 12 years. I actually go to church most every Sunday So it's different. I'm now having involvement. I have a reason and Tiding just makes sense We like it doesn't seem to hurt us. We seem to be alright. So it's been good so I'd say pray about it. Ruth writes down every bill we get per month and we've had them for years and we have these demo books that you can go back in 15-20 years and you can see some of the ups and downs, the changes, how things have done, we've done differently. How long it took to pay off the loan. So when you buy something you can see the length of time you do. as far as your giving is fine with me. But if you can say to God, yep, this is the way it is and I'm right, then that's fine. But if you're just making a lot of excuses, don't make them to me, make them to God.

I melt those down and add whatever ingredients I want to add to them and put them in the fun molds and let it cool and then I wrap it and sell it. And that's why it's called melt and pour. Cold process is like real homemade soap. You mix fats with lye and water and that turns into the soap that you see at like whole foods and stuff like that. It's usually in a loaf. Sometimes you can slice it yourself. The reason that I prefer melt and pour right now over cold process soap is because you have to use lye when you're making cold process soap. And I'm always very careful when I work with lye. I use goggles, I use a charcoal mask, I use big rubber gloves, long sleeves. I was very foolish when I first started soap. I got all covered up, goggles, mask, gloves, and flip-flops. I got one teeny tiny grain of lye on my foot. I know that most of you have seen Fight Club and you remember the part when Tyler Durden puts lye on Edward Norton's hand. That's how it's activated when it's mixed with water. It kind of froths up just a little bit and releases a lot of fumes. You have to do it in a well-ventilated area. Usually what I do is I mix and then I set it outside while the temperature drops back down so that I don't trip over it or the cat gets into it or whatever. But when I got married, I became a stepmom and I have three stepkids and I also just recently had my very first baby. So when I was in the nesting period and when I was going through the house, baby proofing the house, the lie was the first thing to go and even though it was in a place that I'm sure or no one would ever get to, I just couldn't bear the thought of any of them getting into that stuff. But what you have to remember is once it's mixed, first you mix the lye with the water and the temperature shoots skyrockets. And while that temperature is going up, you have to take fats. You can use animal fat or you can use vegetable fat. I only use vegetable fat, but a lot of times people will use lard or tallow. And I know some major soap The but something full of lye on your body and it doesn't eat your skin off. So yeah, so that's why I use melt-in-pore right now. I just feel better about it in the house with all these kids. But I do plan to carry some cold process soaps on my site soon. The friend of mine who taught me how to make soap in the first place is going to start selling soaps on my site and I'm really looking forward to that. She's an amazing soap maker, very creative and very clever. use her soap daily. She has a face soap that I have in the shower right now that I cannot be without.

And I know some major soap company is do put animal fats in their soaps. I know I received a thing of body wash in my Christmas stocking that had animal fats in it and I threw it out. So the lye heats up so you put fat on the stove and you heat that up and eventually the lye will start to come back down and when the fats and the lye are the same temperature you mix it together and a chemical change occurs it's called saponification and that's when it becomes soap.

Io credo che comunque la recensione è una cosa molto importante che poi può determinare quello che è il successo o il fallimento di un disco, perché chiaramente il potere della penna, no? Cioè se tu hai in certo peso e scrivi delle cose sbagliate perché allora se il disco è veramente brutto è giusto dirlo. ma la persona che scrive al dovere verso chi legge di sentire il prodotto, di studiarlo, io spesso ho letto recensioni nostre, dove non veniva descritto nemmeno un brano, ho impassato, quindi se lo che io e lo stonato quando io vive, no, solo la chitarra, quindi voglio dire, era un po' difficile per me essere stoato, quello voleva dire che non ha mai nemmeno messo il ciline del lettore, perché altrimenti non Sì, sì. quindi venite a metà novembre di nuovo in un tour? Sì, sì, sì. Ok, ora lascio il nome a voglio. Ok, ben, anzi tutto, ringrazio a te e staff, per gli heavy metal.it ovviamente e niente, spero che questo nuovo disco sia apprezzato per quello che è. Spero che venga capito il sacrificio che c'è dietro a un progetto ambizioto come il nostro, cioè portare avanti per quasi dieci anni stessa saga è stato veramente una cosa non facile perché chiaramente ogni volta dover aggiungere un nuovo pezzo a questo caso non è stato facile anche se c'era già il presupposto dietro diciamo era già tutto pronto a livello di storia però sai devi scrivere un discontero non è una cosa facile e spero che i nostri fan apprezzino questa cosa e spero di vederli numerosi quando vedremo dalle nostre parti e pro con Ciao, grazie mille, ciao.","what we are saying, I don't know, we said before that the last album, let's say, are very similar, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I think that even the historical groups like Stratowarius, Gamma Ray and the Heroines themselves are doing a little bit... I wouldn't say they're taking a step back, but surely they will. I think they want to do something different, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same thing for 10 years, they want to do the same because they read a genre or a name. I think that the review is very important and it can determine what the success or failure of a record is because it is the power of the pen. If you have a certain weight and write wrong things, because if the record is really bad it is right to say it, But the person who writes to have to listen to the product, to study it, I often read our reviews where it was not written in less than a song, I said in the past that I was stunned when I saw the guitar, so it was a bit difficult for me to be stunned. I think we should come to Turin again, I think it's November 12th at the factory, We will have a lot of other dates, even in the studio, in a way that is similar to ours.

Yes, yes. Ok, now? I don't want to. Ok, first of all I thank you, staff, for the heavy metal.it, obviously. I hope this new album is appreciated for what it is. I hope you understand the sacrifice behind a project like ours, bringing it forward for almost 10 years. It was not easy to make a new piece of this piece, even if it was already in the back. I hope our fans appreciate this and I hope to see them again when we will see them from our sides. Bye, thank you very much, bye!"

I left a whole bunch of stuff out because they run the show all week long and I want you guys to look at it. It's a really good show. So that's just a short synopsis of what went on and I hope you enjoy it. I'm going to watch Ante Garage. just come around in a couple of seconds and I would thank y'all for your participation back on the tour."

This is Hank and this is Frank and they're going to be my audience volunteers today. And you can see that Frank's got a skin condition over here. Don't stare, staring through it. But that's not why I asked you here. You know when you get a new pair of running shoes and the laces you get on them are ridiculously long. I mean, why do they do that? I have to end up trimming them down all the time. So what I do is I bunch them up into a little ball Squish them all down and then you've got to grab an end. Hang on. Where is that end? Alright, there's one there. And Frank, if you would hold on to this end. Thank you so much, Frank. And Hank. Oh, Frank doesn't like his. Hang on a minute. You hang on to that there. Frank, being difficult. And Hank, if you would hang on to that end there. Sorry for squeezing so hard. And then I need my scissors. So, oh, oh, sorry. Over here. Oh no, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. I think they're under here. Oh no, I remember now. I keep them right up. Oh no, we don't need them anymore. Hank and Frank, you guys. To do the shoelace trick, you need a long shoelace and you need to do a little bit of work on it. Let's have a look. You're gonna get a regular shoelace Cut about 30cm off one end. That will give you a piece like this and the rest. Then you get yourself a piece of tape and you're going to tape around the ends of those cuts and remake the little hard bits. Once you have your long piece and your short piece, you put two ends together, hold them in whatever hand you want and then The You then go to this end and start to push it in and then you go almost like an afterthought. Oh, I need to find the other end. So simply this is the short piece. You just start to grab the short piece and no one can really see what's going on in here. Don't panic. Take your time. It's like you're trying to find the end and you just simply pull out the other side of the short piece and now that's the short piece. It's just draped across the top of that there and you get your volunteers to hold one side there and one side behind. and when you do it make sure that they grab it by the little hard end because just psychologically they know that there's only two ends on a shoelace and if you give them those bits to hold it just strengthens the illusion. And then you go to find your imaginary perisceses which you don't need to have perisceses you just say you're going to get them. Now if you're holding it in your right hand you go to your left side first and you've got to make the moves slightly over exaggerated. because wherever you move, your audience will follow and they will look because this is all about misdirection. So I go over here to get my scissors. Oh, sorry. I forgot. And then I come back here and I'm going to mime like I'm trying to take this whole bunched up bit and not let it fall apart. But all I do is actually take, and this is just all miming is actually take the short rope out and hold that the long bits in the hand there. And then I go, Oh no, it's over here. down and all I do is just pull this away, nothing fancy, just pull it away and as I go under the table I drop it down there or you put it in your pocket if you're strolling around and then you come out from that side and go oh it's not there, hang on a minute, you pretend you're going to grab all this, now there's only this string there, you just mine going through there, carefully tuck it in and then you go uh-huh it's under here, I'll just go somewhere else so that you've got it and then one more time you come back and you mine doing it I like going up to my head and if you don't have a hat it doesn't matter because you can just say I keep the scissors on top of my head. The idea is you go, so we've come from this position go, I remember and you actually look up and when you look up his eyes and his eyes will go up. You watch give it a go. That's where their eyes will go and you go up on I keep them and I pick up my hat or reach on there and that's when I let go with this hand here and go to grab and I go, oh no we don't need them now and I look down and they'll look at the same time and they'll see that they've got that short bit of string in their hands. And that's the funny bit. And if other people are watching, it's their reactions that make this fun. So this is more a gag than a strong trick. And I've only had it about a dozen times strolling now and I found it's actually been quite successful. The reason that you want to use a shoelace as well or a thin piece of cord is because you can pleat it up a lot easier and smaller in your hand. You can do it with a piece of rope but the piece of rope can't be long because it gets bulky and then that difference in actual size doesn't show up as well. Alright, remember if I can do it, you can do it.","Welcome back to Julian's Magician School and I should introduce my friends.

Particles are visual effects that you can add to enhance your scene, like dust, smoke, and fire. I've set up a simple scene where I've recorded myself both as a medic and heavy moving through this area. Because I captured this alone, I wasn't able to use my medic gun on the heavy, so I'll have to insert that particle system. For any scene to which you want to add particles, you can browse what's available to you by selecting Windows Particle Editor Tool. This switches the window to a a mode where you can load in a particle file, which are grouped by function, to preview how it appears. This may change your window to be smaller and one which cannot be resized on the fly. To change this, you can alter your launch properties for the SFM. Right-click on the application icon and select Properties. In the space next to Target, add the options Dash W and Dash H to set the width and height in pixels. I've got this set to 1920 by 1080. These changes just take effect when you relaunch the tool. So since I want to add the medic gun beam, I'll go to File, Open, where I can browse for a particle configuration file. Navigate to the Game, TF, Particles folder, then select medicgunbeam.pcf. This shows me all the particle definitions that exist in that group, and I can preview which one is appropriate to use, in this case, medic gun beam blue. Now, I'll select Tools, switch to SFM, then right click in the Animation Set Editor and select Create Animation Set for New Particle System. This brings up a window where I can browse the Particle System definition file, then use the drop down menu to select MetaGunBeamBlue. Note that the start time is where the playhead currently is located, but I can easily change this number, and I'll make it before the shot so the particles exist when the shot starts. Then, I'll lengthen its duration and lifetime to go beyond my shot length and select OK. You can easily change these values in the Animation Set Editor, right-clicking on the particle system and selecting Edit Particle System Start, Stop, End Times. Now, I'll quickly attach this to the MetaGun in Heavy using the technique shown in the tutorial video called Locks. If you haven't yet watched that, I'd suggest you do, so you can understand how I'm able to lock the particle system to the motion of the MetaGun and Heavy. Note that if a particle system has two control points, control point zero is the 0 is where the particle emits from, and control point 1 is where it moves to. If you don't see a particle system that you've just added, move the playhead to another shot and move back, and that will refresh the shot and the particles will be visible. Now, as metagun beam appears as it does in the game. But, you can control every parameter of the particle system to change its appearance however you wish. Doing so is not for the faint of heart, as it's a very complex process with lots of variables and functions that aren't easy to understand. So do so without expectation. As an example, if I wanted to make the medic gun green as if it made players sick instead of healing them, I can change its parameters to do just that. To edit a particle system, right click on it in the Animation Set Editor and select Show an Element Viewer Particle System. Then right click on the particle system and select Instance Particle System. This essentially creates a copy of the particle system and allows you to play with it. with its properties. A plus sign is added next to the particle system definition, which, when you expand it, has all the information about the particles. It also adds a button to the right with three dots in it, and clicking on that brings up the particle system editor. The Metagun beam particle system is fairly complex, with many children listed in the children properties. So to simplify things, I'm going to delete all but the blue trail stage 3 and pluses. In the lower right, click accept. these particles one at a time. So in the particle system definition, clicking on the plus next to the Metagun beam blue trail expands some of its parameters. And another box with three dots in it appears next to the child. I'll click that to bring back up the particle system editor. Since this particle system has two control points where particles flow from point zero to point one, in the control points tab in the upper left, I'm going to move point one 100 units in X so I can see the effect over a distance. I can control the view in the window to the right by left mouse clicking and dragging to orbit, middle mouse to pan, and right mouse to zoom. I'll start by changing the color of the trail to green. In the lower left window, all the particle system properties are listed, and these are the parameters which affect how the particle system behaves. This is where things can get very complicated very fast, so again, proceed with caution. And as long as you save a lot, there's no harm in playing with these to see what effect each parameter has. There are only two attributes in the system properties that you'll likely ever adjust. Material is the image or sprite used by the particle system. The particle system is actually placing an image on a square plane that's oriented to camera, and this button allows you to browse which image the system will use. Max Particles sets the upper limit for the number of particles that system will allow, and is used more for optimization in the game. But if you increase your rate, you might want to increase this number as well. Under the system properties are different fields which determine how they're rendered, what properties they start with, how those properties change over time, and what forces are acting on them. Each particle has its own list of parameters in these sections which define how the particles behave, and you can alter, remove, or add functions in these sections to affect its behavior. Right-click on any of these parameters to do that. For example, right-clicking on objects operator and selecting add brings up a huge list of functions that can be added to that section to affect what changes happen as the particle system is running, and seeing that list gives you an idea of how involved the controls can be. This is where advanced users can really dig in to get the effect they want. But for this example, we'll keep things simple. Selecting the renderer affects some overall properties for the particles, but it's rare that you'll need to change parameters in this section. do the most changing are emitter, initializer, and operator. Emitter usually has a function called emit continuously and the parameters you'll most likely alter are the emission rate which sets how many particles are emitted per second and duration which sets how long in seconds particles will be emitted. Note that this is set to zero which means it will continue indefinitely. You can fade it in and out here as well. The initializer section determines how the particles will act when emitted and the operator section determines how the particles will act over time. So to change the beam to green, I'll select Color Random under the initializer list. The first two parameters are Color 1 and Color 2. So by clicking on the color swatches, I can quickly change each of them to green. Click OK to accept these changes. Note that this change is reflected in the main viewport as well. You'll notice that over the length of the beam, the color changes from green to blue. That's because there's a parameter in the operator section called Color Fade. Again, all these properties act on the particle system after each particle is emitted. Select the Color Fade parameter, click on the swatch next to Color Fade, and make it green. Click Accept in the lower right to close out the window. Now I'll alter the pluses. Click on the three dots next to the child parameter for Metagun being blue pluses. I want to change the rotation by 45 degrees so they look more like an X than a plus. So I'll add a parameter to the initializer called rotation random. If I change the value of rotation initial to 45 and set rotation offset max to 0, you can see that they are all now rotated 45 degrees and look more like an X. I'll change their color random and color fade to green just as I did for the beam. And lastly, instead of having them get smaller, I'll make them get bigger over time. I'll select radius scale and the operator. list and change the radius start scale to 2 and the radius end scale to 10. And you can see that over time they grow bigger. So that's a brief overview of how to modify particle systems in the SFM. This just scratched the surface of its capabilities and its features are quite complex and deep and really mastering the toolset and understanding the parameters will take a lot of experimentation by those who wish to explore it. But this gives you an idea of how you can alter existing particle systems or create your own to get the exact look you're aiming for. Thanks for watching and good luck!","Hi, today I'm going to talk about using particles in the SFM. Particles are visual effects that you can add to enhance your scene, like dust, smoke, and fire. I've set up a simple scene where I've recorded myself both as a medic and heavy moving through this area. Because I captured this alone, I wasn't able to use my medic gun on the heavy, so I'll have to insert that particle system. For any scene to which you want to add particles, you can browse what's available to you by selecting Windows Particle Editor Tool. This switches the window to a a mode where you can load in a particle file which are grouped by function to preview how it appears. This may change your window to be smaller and one which cannot be resized on the fly. To change this you can alter your launch properties for the SFM. Right-click on the application icon and select properties. In the space next to target add the options dash w and dash h to set the width and height in pixels. I've got this set to 1920 by 1080. These changes just take effect when you relaunch the tool. So since I want to add the Medic Gun Beam, I'll go to File, Open where I can browse for a particle configuration file. Navigate to the Game, TF, Particles folder, then select MedicGunBeam.pcf. This shows me all the particle definitions that exist in that group, and I can preview which one is appropriate to use. In this case, Medic Gun Beam Blue. Now, I'll select Tools, switch to SFM, Then right click in the Animation Set Editor and select Create Animation Set for New Particle System. This brings up a window where I can browse the Particle System definition file, then use the drop down menu to select MetaGunBeamBlue. Note that the start time is where the playhead currently is located, but I can easily change this number, and I'll make it before the shot so the particles exist when the shot starts. Then I'll lengthen its duration and lifetime to go beyond my shot length and select OK. You can easily change these values in the Animation Set Editor, right-clicking on the particle system and selecting Edit Particle System Start, Stop, End Times. Now, I'll quickly attach this to the MetaGun in Heavy using the technique shown in the tutorial video called LOCKS. If you haven't yet watched that, I'd suggest you do, so you can understand how I'm able to lock the particle system to the motion of the MetaGun and Heavy. Note that if a particle system has two control points, control point zero Now, as Metagun beam appears as it does in the game. But, you can control every parameter of the particle system to change its appearance however you wish. Doing so is not for the faint of heart, as it's a very complex process with lots of variables and functions that aren't easy to understand. So do so without expectation. As an example, if I wanted to make the medic gun green as if it made players sick instead of healing them, I can change its parameters to do just that. To edit a particle system, right click on it in the Animation Set Editor and select Show an Element Viewer, Particle System. Then right click on the particle system and select Instance Particle System. This essentially creates a copy of the particle system and allows you to play with it. with its properties. A plus sign is added next to the particle system definition, which, when you expand it, has all the information about the particles. It also adds a button to the right with three dots in it, and clicking on that brings up the particle system editor. The Metagun beam particle system is fairly complex, with many children listed in the children properties. So to simplify things, I'm going to delete all but the blue trail stage 3 and pluses. In the lower right, click accept. these particles one at a time. So in the particle system definition, clicking on the plus next to the Metagun beam blue trail expands some of its parameters. And another box with three dots in it appears next to the child. I'll click that to bring back up the particle system editor.

He's not going to give us anything on top of what's already wrong until we repent, until we understand what all of these things are. And let me say now, a lot of the struggles going on, even with our government, struggles with money, struggles in Asia, struggles all over the world. You know, I know I'm not supposed to be very detailed here, but you know, the peace talks, the things that we're talking about in the world, today that are great climatic things that are just shake everything is just in a turmoil does that have anything with the coming of a new millennium sure it certainly does but that's only a manifestation of a dimension that God is trying to bring us into it's not the time we're not waiting for the times to mature we're waiting for the church to mature yeah that whole thing is the groaning and travail of the whole creation groans and travails and all it's groaning for is it's looking for the manifestation of the sons of God. I borrowed pieces from here and there put it together say this sounds good that worked over there Let's try that hey this sounds like that's a good idea. You've ever done that. Let's try that Preaches get together paste these things all up when they get them all through they say okay now We're gonna start a church and here's what we're going to do right and the truth is that God never told him to do that in the first place God never told David I want you to build me a house He never told him that but David he wanted to do it so he jumped up to do it You know there's a lot of a lot of things that you are doing developed an entire industry around the production of a church. And in the final analysis, it's when we start messing with that kind of stuff that we really have problems. There is, in my estimation, there is something that is going on in the rumblings. And when you said, we do not know what this church will look like, I'll tell you one of the things that the Spirit of the Lord said to me very clearly. He said, we will be able to to identify one another. In other words, when I meet one, I'll know them. When I come in contact with one, I'll know them. They will be across denominational lines, they will be across ethnic lines, they'll be across national and international lines. But when we come in a relationship with one another, it will resonate. And I'm finding as I travel, and as I preach and I'm finding that God is raising these men and they're out there. I need to say something very quickly because you hit on something a few minutes ago and you were talking about you know We think that we've arrived we think we've done this and done this when we get to a certain level The fact of the matter is just like you were talking about with Solomon the men and the women of God perhaps Even in this hour that God is using are not there because they've arrived They're there because they're in the right dimension. That's the right place And they may be lesser that or this way they may be lesser characters of course and some other people people who are pristine and don't have a pimple on them. You know, and that's the first attack religion does is it goes back and says, yeah, well, he might be a great preacher, but you know what happened to him 15 years ago? You know what he went through. And the whole issue is, as you said earlier in the program tonight, is that a priest taken from among men to be made a high priest over men, Hebrews 5, must offer sacrifice for himself as for the people. He must have compassion on the ignorant, them that are out of the way, in that he himself has been He's been totally surrounded by unstable situations and circumstances and he survived Huh? We throw the people away, you know we would we would have saved Saul and killed David We save our souls sure because Absolutely David sin was a sin of the flesh Saul sin was a sin of the spirit. Yeah, God killed Saul and gave David a Messiah We've done the other because we are so earthly Yeah. Man can hand you a scepter, but if he hands you the scepter, he can take your crown. But if God ever says you are who you are, it doesn't matter what other men say you are all night. And God is getting ready to raise. And that is why the relationship with God is so important because it is only there where we really know who we are. What you say I am, what men say I am, what this one says, what that, you this, you this, you this. That doesn't matter. It's what God says you are. And you won't hear that without a relationship. You're about to say something. I want to go back and say, If you ask most any pastor, preacher, minister, bishop, whatever today, or Christian, you know, our friends, all of our church people, if you ask them, what is your vision? What is your purpose in the Kingdom of God? They'll say, man, we're going to reach our city. Oh, listen, God, God, we're going to take this valley for God. They're going to say, well, you know, we really want to, we want our church to grow. I mean, these are the things that you get response. Am I right? You're right. Okay. If I say, what is your vision? Everybody's going to say, well, listen, I, you know, I want to become a pastor. I want to win people to God. I want to win the lost. So what we have done is we have made our target, we have made our goal, reaching the world, turning the world upside down, doing all of these powerful things out here. Okay? That's our goal. The problem is not in what we want to do. God wanted a house. He just didn't want David to build it. The problem is not that we don't need the world one. The problem is that we don't need the world one. is we think we know how to do it. And so we go borrow from world systems ideas on marketing. We got borrow ideas on how to talk to people, how to win friends and influence people and all of that. We try to take all of these worldly things. And so we feel that if we can then, if since we know what the goal is, the purpose is, now we've got to work and do all these things to get to it. When I was a kid on the farm, I was given a I went all over the place, man, I'm telling you, squirrels and rabbits were safe, nothing was in danger. Nothing, you know, because I couldn't hit anything. And I learned some things, you know, there was a place on the bow where the arrow lay, a rest. So it was there every time just like that. When I pull it back, I could point at something here and I'd get the point exactly, exactly right on that, and I'd shoot and I'd go boom, way up there. I'd pull it back. Next time I put the point on exactly the same spot, I'd get the point on the right side of the arrow. same place and boom it'd go down there. What I didn't realize was that there was an anchor point. There was a foundational point back here on this string that this projectile, it doesn't matter that point rarely moves out there it's gonna stay there even if this comes down that you can still put the point on the target but you're gonna hit way up there. The point still stays basically so you raise it up to the point but see because this thing is varying back here this is what the church has lost. It's lost its anchor point so that there is no alignment between the back foundations and what we're pointing at. We want to reach the world but we're shooting up here and hitting down here because we don't know how to reach the world. We think that we need to go and preach. We need to go on the table and we need to do all these things. I really think that the greatest power for television is to reach the... I used to think that was not true. I went off television years ago because I was tired preaching to Christians. I want to reach the world. centers. Now I think the most powerful tool is reaching the Christian today. If we could reach the Christians, we could reach the world. Exhorting one another daily. I've got to come to this point. This is really important. I've got to get to this. If we don't come into proper church government and order, if we don't come into order in our lives, if we try to duplicate what has been done in the past, we are never going to see the coming up of that glorious thing. There's got to be a travailing, a birthing, a crying out, a heart hunger after God. Now that in my opinion is the veil. Okay? If we take these three dimensions again, seems like we're jumping here a little bit, but if we take these three dimensions again, if I go from the outer court to the holy place, if I'm going into the holiest of holies, I've got to go through a veil.","for God to give us a mighty river. He's not going to give us anything on top of what's already wrong until we repent, until we understand what all of these things are. And let me say now, a lot of the struggles going on, even with our government, struggles with money, struggles in Asia, struggles all over the world. You know, I know I'm not supposed to be very detailed here, but you know, the peace talks, the things that we're talking about in the world, today that are great climatic things that are just shake everything is just in a turmoil Does that have anything with the coming of a new millennium? Sure it certainly does but that's only a manifestation of a dimension that God is trying to bring us into it's not the time We're not waiting for the times to mature. We're waiting for the church to mature. Yeah That whole thing is the groaning and travail of the whole creation Growns and travails and all it's groaning for is it's looking for the manifestation of the sons of God. I borrowed pieces from here and there put it together say this sounds good that worked over there Let's try that hey this sounds like that's a good idea. You've ever done that. Let's try that Preaches get together paste these things all up when they get them all through they say okay now We're gonna start a church and here's what we're going to do right and the truth is that God never told him to do that in the first place God never told David I want you to build me a house He never told him that but David he wanted to do it so he jumped up to do it You know there's a lot of a lot of things that you are doing are dealing with. And of course now I'm, you know, I've got enemies too, so I might as well make more. But I got friends. You got friends. But the fact of the matter is there's a lot of things that are going on. You know, there's a lot of user friendly churches and all this kind of stuff. And Marty, guys going out and they're building churches by knocking on doors in the community and finding out what the people want. And you know, I don't think Jesus ever told us to find out what the people want. I think He told us what to preach and what to give. And we have developed an entire industry around the production of a church. And in the final analysis, it's when we start messing with that kind of stuff that we really have problems. There is, in my estimation, there is something that is going on in the rumblings. And when you said, we do not know what this church will look like, I'll tell you one of the things that the Spirit of the Lord said to me very clearly. He said, we will be able to to identify one another. In other words, when I meet one, I'll know them. When I come in contact with one, I'll know them. They will be across denominational lines, they will be across ethnic lines, they'll be across national and international lines. But when we come in a relationship with one another, it will resonate. And I'm finding as I travel, and as I preach, and I'm finding that God is raising these men, and they're out there. I need to say something very quickly because you hit on something a few minutes ago and you were talking about, you know, we think that we've arrived, we think we've done this and done this when we get to a certain level. The fact of the matter is, just like you were talking about with Solomon, the men and the women of God, perhaps even in this hour that God is using, are not there because they've arrived, they're there because they're in the right dimension, they're at the right place. And they may be lesser characters. Of course. people who are pristine and don't have a pimple on them. You know, and that's the first attack religion does is it goes back and says, yeah, well, he might be a great preacher. But you know what happened to him 15 years ago, you know what he went through. And the whole issue is, as you said earlier in the program tonight is that a priest taken from among men to be made a high priest over men, Hebrews five, right, must offer sacrifice for himself as well. Yeah, he must have compassion on the ignorant, them that out of the way in that he himself has been He's been totally surrounded by unstable situations and circumstances and he survived Huh? We throw the people away, you know, we would we would have saved Saul and killed David We save our souls sure because Absolutely David sin was a sin of the flesh Saul sin was a sin of the spirit. Yeah, God killed Saul and gave David a Messiah We've done the other because we are so earthly Yeah. Man can hand you a scepter, but if he hands you the scepter you can take your crown. But if God ever says you are who you are, it doesn't matter what other men say you are all night. And God is getting ready to raise. And that is why the relationship with God is so important because it is only there where we really know who we are. What you say I am, what men say I am, what this one says, what that, you this, you this, you this. That doesn't matter. It's what God says you are. And you won't hear that without a relationship. You're about to say something. If you ask most any pastor, preacher, minister, bishop, whatever, today, or Christian, you know, our friends, all of our church people, if you ask them, what is your vision? What is your purpose in the Kingdom of God? They'll say, man, we're going to reach our city. Oh, listen, God, God, we're going to take this valley for God. They're going to say, well, you know, we really want to, we want our church to grow. I mean, these are the things that you get response. Am I right? You're right. Okay. If I say, what is your vision? Everybody's going to say, well, listen, I, you know, I want to become a church. I want to win people to God. I want to win the lost. So what we have done is we have made our target, we have made our goal, reaching the world, turning the world upside down, doing all of these powerful things out here, okay? That's our goal. The problem is not in what we want to do. God wanted a house. He just didn't want David to build it. The problem is not that we don't need the world one. The problem is that we don't need the world one. is we think we know how to do it. And so we go borrow from world systems ideas on marketing. We got borrow ideas on how to talk to people, how to win friends and influence people and all of that. We try to take all of these worldly things.
