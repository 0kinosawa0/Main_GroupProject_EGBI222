It was all square at the top of the championship table. The battle for seventh position and sixth position was sealed when Benderbosch made a smart move around the outside of Giovanni Bussai. But no one rode smart and this guy all day long, Manu Hermunna on the CH Racing, Husqvarna. Having another battle there on the final lap was Christian Ravaglia and Tiaz.

I'm going to give him a little ripple, a little shake. Your card being the nine of diamonds is now on the mat. The ace of spades is back on top of the deck. I'm going to take and cut the deck, put your card back in the middle, give it a little snap, and the rice is back to the top. I'm going to do that one more time. Cut, snap, back to the top. What I'm going to do is I'm going to make it little nice and easy. There's your card. Nine of diamonds. Middle of a deck. Ripple. Snap. To the top. Now, make a little bit different.

Fire vs nature on map HALADU and Yabro is building parwell and Disciplet also parwell but outside of the middle another dryad and Sunstriders yes universe first shot of the game and both players don't want to engage just now oh Yabro is going for monument this is nature monument so twilight deck we're seeing how this apple will respond to this I think yes he won't build his or forces own again manawing really funny stuff that we can see in manawing that often now yeah this you can see now strange of manawing okay I am mistaken now it sucks to shot me to to shot manawing nice I think he didn't knew. Something new. Still, Mowing sucks. Second tier. What is Spell and Venom? Let's call it. Thing is, Ev-Venom is really great against Hellfire. But I don't think he got enough firepower to kill everything in this base. Yeah. Only one squad left. And he don't have... Eh, he have an MG to build his own orb. or pure nature vs twilight first brewer of the matchup and skyfire this standard combo very strong because Lee hard to counter brewer is great vs range units because he can run away and skyfire is great vs melee units because they can't shoot and attack him I think that he... yeah he's dead I'm not sure why this hyperlid isn't defending. Spirit Hunters won't do anything against this mortal tower. And he needs to start shooting. And this parable is down. That's all. I see from both players it's a lot of sloppy play. Mistakes on the first matchup and the second matchup also a lot of mistakes. so skyfire will have a lot of chance against them even in our field another mvenom just cost about 50, yeah 75 energy i think mvenom saw is warfare so use heal and he's running for parrel fire sword yeah and this is problem with this deep one because yeah he can walk away now I'm not sure why he want to use this one Last second owing from almost both players You can see We're waiting period are always boring And oh we can see that those kite friends are in full charge on the second level This is also unusual with this type of high level players I'm not sure what decks are playing Yeah, bro, what? Yeah. And this deep one... No, we will not die. And again, we can see this problem with this one deep one. This deep one. That without route, he can't attack enough this enemy fire swan to destroy it. Another enemy Venom. And first Ravage to defend it. Yeah, he really should use... green affixion d1 for the for route it's a lot of battery man opinion and yeah and then on this weaker than ravage and even yeah even the don't deal damage if you need that is casted on don't deal damage it's pretty fun as well yeah surrender so if you like this subscribe and see you next time"

We meet again today for Sniper. So we meet again on my screen. I was with friends, we had fun and you will see that it's going to be a good gameplay. I'm going to play a game play from today, February 1st, a sniper game play in different games. It will be MW2, MW3, Black Ops 2 and Call of Duty 4. I'm going to play a game play in this project for a month. We were waiting for our whole team to get killed to make the best of him. I'm very motivated for this new project. I'm waiting with the impression that the month of February is coming. So always subscribe, leave comments, I always answer. I introduced you to who I was. I was with Fit Flush and Nice. I'm going to make a 360 and I think it was 1080. So in this sleeve I didn't kill. We will not see the quillcon but you will see anyway. I think it will be in this one, the first 360. So I hope this new series will please you. Tomorrow I think it will be the NW3 So I will do a white line on the NW3 So I think tomorrow it will be a shooting part of my studio And that's it I will not talk much I just wanted to watch my videos So I will put that right I think that in this month I will do two kills To die I don't remember anymore but I will not die much I will do some trick shots to have fun So there I go back to the first flash cop I think it will be in this sleeve, the 360mm. Yes, it will be now. I take a heat marker and I take the 360mm. We will not see the Quilcom, I think. It's me the Quilcom, we will not see it. I think you liked it. I had fun. 2 shots that went I think and that's where I'm going to die I don't know too much so here we had fun in this game it was really only 3-6, Strix Shot, Flash Cops, Titanic so here it was really the 3 friends to have fun to find each other so here it is so I will repeat it again, talk about my channel, subscribe so here beautiful double feed and there you will see the Kiltam of fixed flush, well played to him, double-ed or the 20 It's beautiful, I won't take it away from me, it's a shame. So he managed to double the album. So I chose 4A0 without searching for instructions. So what I said earlier, subscribe to my channel, speak to your friends, so the little hitmarker. I don't know if you can write well the hitmarkers with the quality. So here, speak to them, subscribe, like the videos. And here I am going to do this new series. So if it works well, I kill it in the case 40. So if it works well, then why not with the machine guns? For example, only one month of machine guns, only snipers. I will try to make some tutorials with you in the game. So if it can be good, then better. I hope so. I'm going to die in this game, and after that I'm going to do a small 1080p, but it's really not perfect. I'm doing 1080p, but I'm really waiting for a little moment, but not at all long. So there you see, you're trying to go in this game, the fit flush is done, I'm done, but if you kill everyone, we lose this game, I don't think so. It's all in the underground but it will be well heated for us to keep. And now we are all going to shoot. I decided to leave. So here I am, my friend Michael who is online. I really like him. I know him in the private life. I really like him. It's a photo. Besides, I will upload it right after the video. So here I am doing a 40mm illumination. And my next illumination will be the little frame in 1080. And there you will see, no it's not ok, that's it, here in the room to finish well. So I hope you enjoyed this video, subscribe to my channel and come back tomorrow for a little gameplay. Hi everyone and subscribe do not forget and share my channel. Come on, bye bye."

Bueno en este encuentro La segunda vez que vengo me he reencontrado con papás de muchos renaceres de otro país, de otros países vecinos. Y la verdad que estoy en un estado diferente porque recorrí un camino diferente a mi primera vez en venir acá y me siento distinta, me siento como que he elegido pares para acompañarme a mí y yo ahora puedo acompañar a vosotros. y de renacer, que no puede decir de ser el grupo que ha sido el iniciador, que no quiere contar del funcionamiento, de algo que tengan permiso hacer en lo que va el año, al resto de la vida. de actividades y hay algo confirmado por intergrupo, algo que nos pueda llegar a contar, para que se entere en los compañeros que nos están viendo. Bueno, yo me inicié en el Sácaxetán de Belgrano, me recibieron con mucho afecto, mucho cariño, llegué con todos los padres destruidos y ahora, así como me dieron a mí, yo ahora puedo dar, también recibí a otros papás nuevos, que se inician al camino, con los mismos papás que están desde hace mucho tiempo y lo que nota, la diferencia que noto es que renacer sigue creciendo, siempre va para adelante. ¿Qué otras cosas pensamos seguir? Bueno, siempre hay cosas para hacer, integrarnos sobre todo, unirnos con otros grupos para facilitarnos el poder de seguir creciendo. de movimiento cultural o esa revolución cultural que el que está fuera por ahí no le entiende porque hay papás fundamentalmente en ese grupo de muchos años en renacer, cómo se produce este trasvasamiento, cómo el papá de tantos años va abriendo las puertas del grupo para que otros papás sigan el camino como es el caso de Mercedes por ejemplo con respecto a Graciela Scantelero y otra mamá más que no vale la pena no, porque son muchas, nos olvidamos en algunos y se enojan, pero cómo se está produciendo eso? Yo creo que eso se produce por el amor El haber pasado por el dolor que nos tocó a todos los papás, lo que seguimos quedando no se ha remasar es dando amor. Creo que es la fórmula mágica y es lo que nos han dejado nuestros hijos. Por eso ahora pudimos volver a reír y a tener proyectos, sobre todo. Cosa que en un primer momento a nadie se le pasaba por la cabeza, estar como estamos ahora, después de haber recorrido es un largo camino porque no es fácil, pero la fuerza que nos han dado nuestros hijos y nuestros compañeros que nos han antecedido a nosotros con el apoyo de ellos creo que se puede. Estás devolviendo, como comúnmente se dice. Ahora estoy devolviendo y siempre agradecida, muy agradecida por todo lo que me han dado y yo poder ahora dar porque en un primer momento uno está muy vacío de todo verdad ahora después de seis años realmente es muy gratificante es un homenaje también a Comaruel y a todos los hijos porque son como una familia todos nuestros hijos no te que para menos duda te agradecemos Mercedes gracias por estos minutitos y seguir disfrutando de este encuentro gracias muy lindo","This is the time of one of the primary groups of the Federal Capital and the Grand Buenos Aires because some of the partners who do not know how to organize it, there are not only groups in the interior of the country, but of course in the Federal Capital and in the Grand Buenos Aires. And besides all that, some other parts of the country, and then they go to see other little notes, as we see with Papa de Paraguay, Papa de Chile. But now it's time to talk about the group that was established in Buenos Aires, which is San Cayetano, from the neighborhood of Belgrano. Ernesto Mercedes, one of the people who was there a while ago, is the group of Graciela Canteros for all those who know. And basically what we need to ask is, the pioneer group that has just completed 16 years, the other year Renacer Buenos Aires, to this group that was born the initiator of this cultural revolution, as Gustavo Berti likes to say, which is Renacer. What does this meeting mean to you, Mercedes? Well, in this meeting The second time I come I have met with many parents from many births of the country, of other neighboring countries and the truth is that I am in a different state because I traveled a different path my first time coming here and I feel different, I feel like I have chosen pairs to accompany me and I can now accompany and the fact that the one who has created Renacer Coroval, who had the first idea, I am very grateful because he has done us well, me and many parents, and always the truth is that our children. and activities and if there is something confirmed by the group or something that can not be told so that the companions who are not well know. Well, I started in San Jose Taneo del Belgrano. They received me with a lot of affection, a lot of affection. I came with all the parents destroyed and now, as they gave me, I can now also receive other new parents who start in the fireplace. with the same parents who have been with us for a long time. And the difference I can see is that Renacer is still growing, he is always moving forward. And what else do we think about? Well, there are always things to do, to integrate, especially, to join with other groups to make it easier to continue growing. cultural movement or that cultural revolution that the one who is out there does not understand it because there is dad and fundamentally in that group for many years to be reborn how this transition is produced how the father of so many years is opening the door of the group so that other dads follow the path as is the case of Mercedes for example with respect to Graciela Scantelero and another mother more than it is worth it because they are many and we forget some and they get angry but how is that happening I think that is produced by love The pain that we all had to face, what we are still doing, is giving love. I think it is the magic formula, and it is what our children have left us. That is why we can now laugh and have projects. Especially things that in the first place, nobody thought about it, as we are now. It's a long way because it's not easy. But the strength our children and our companions have given us, that have preceded us, with their support, I think it can be done. You're returning, as they say. I'm returning and I'm always grateful for everything they have given me. And I can now give because at first you are very empty of everything. After six years, it's really very rewarding. It's a tribute to Manuel and all the children, because they are like a family, all our children. Don't worry about it. Thank you, Mercedes. Thank you for these minutes and keep enjoying this encounter. Thank you."

Единственное, что мне не нравится, это то, что моя манула в детстве меня постоянно обманывала. Она мне в детстве говорила, сынок, ты вы маленький богатый. Ты у меня самый сильный, самый смелый, самый красивый. И только когда я пошел учиться в школу и познакомился с группой таких людей, как алхазян, сиропян, социев, я понял, что я далеко не богатый. Далеко не самый смелый. Но тем не менее я продолжал оставаться самым красивым. чёрта моя мать была права мне же без бороды друзья и кстати про рост хотелось бы узнать в зале я спорю много курящих да поднимите руки курящие люди те кто курят отлично это курящие люди на мой взгляд это самый смешный люди на свете потому что вот многие из них делать знаете они когда курят сигарету докуривают и остаются буквально чуть-чуть там уже бычок и вот они стоят он там где-то стоит мусорка и пытаются прицелиться туда и попасть понимаете это если нужно как-то Кинуть туда, а если они провахиваются, они похорят мусорки, подбирают бычок, а ходят еще на более дальнее расстояние, усложняй себе спорты. Ахорят и опять пытаются попасть. Самое смешное, это когда они пытаются рассказать параллельно с этим еще какую-то историю. То есть они говорят, вчера с девочкой обзакамывался в клубе. Слушаешь, да? Вот, короче, и она... И она... Ну, она, короче, в клубе была, и, да? Вот, и я ее клею. И... И самая горная, они при этом еще кричат, трехок в клубе. Покажите где одно очко! всегда делать какие-то выводы и все то что я вам сказал можно сделать один вывод друзья когда на улице идет дождь носите резиновые спаки спасибо","I want to perform in the hall, there are also Russian people, I am very glad. Well, friends, as you have noticed, I am not a big grown-up, all my friends are tall, and my nickname is small, because I am the smallest, and for my whole life I understood one thing, I hate tall people, but I just don't like these eternal jokes. I was a good parent and a good teacher. The only thing I didn't like was that my mother-in-law was always lying to me. She told me, sonny, you are a little rich. You are the strongest, the most brave and the most beautiful. And when I went to school and met groups of people like Alkhasian, Syrogan, I realized that I am not a rich person. I was not a rich person. But I continued to become the most beautiful. My mom was a real pro. Friends, I'd like to know about the growth of the group. I've seen a lot of smokers. Raise your hands, smokers. Those who smoke. It's great. Smokers are the most funny people in the world. Because many of them smoke, and they stay a little bit there. And they try to get there. And if they are crying, they go to the trash, pick up the bucket, go further away, make it harder for themselves. And they try to get back. The funniest thing is when they try to tell a story parallel to this. They say, there was a girl with a friend from the club. And she was in the club. I stick her. And the worst thing is that they shout, three times in a row. Where is the 3-point line? Where is the line? Show me. Where is the line? Where? Why? Why? Why is it a choice to throw the trash in the trash? 3 km in the trash is all 3 points. One shit. Let's draw 2-3 points. Where is the second team? Tell me. No, let's do it as a delivery. Why? Why not? Let's leave the trash in the trash before the three people. We will throw it over and take it. It's really cooler. Well, you know, in the end of each performance, Always do some conclusions. And all the conclusions I have said, you can make one conclusion. Friends, when the rain is on the street, wear rubber boots. Thank you. Sasha, good bye."

So, for dodge we'll say Neon, Neon, SXT, and Intrepid. And for Honda we will say Civic, Accord, and Crosstour. And for Subaru we'll say Empresa, Outback, and Forester. Okay, so we have our three lists. Now we need to name them. In order to do this, highlight the area that you want to name. Click on Insert, move down to Name and Define. We don't want to call this Dodge, we want to call this Make. You'll see that it automatically populates the Refer to section. If you haven't selected an area, you can change this now. Since we've already selected it, you can simply click OK. Now we need to name this list Dodge because it's going to be directly related to the Dodge option in our first drop-down. So again, we'll go down to Name, click Define, name it Dodge. that these match exactly the options in your first list. So of course our second option list will be Honda and our third list will be Subaru. Now we'll click in cell C4 and then click data either up in the very top or data here and we're looking for validate, data validation or again up here we can click data and go down and click validation. Change the type to list and then source. It's very important that Enter an equal sign and type make. This tells Excel that you want to use the list you have predefined and named make. Now we have a list that drops down. We can choose dodge, Honda or Subaru. The next section is model. We are going to tell Excel to use whatever list is in the make field. We will highlight d4 under model. Again, we will click validate data validation. We will change it to list. Now this time you'd think that you should be able to enter equals and then simply C4. Well, watch what happens when we do that. We change our drop down, dodge. The only option we have is dodge. Why isn't it using the list that we've referred to from C4? Because Excel thinks that we want whatever the value is in C4. There's a way that Excel allows us to work around this, though. It's a function called indirect. So we'll get rid of C4. We'll enter indirect. and then in parentheses enter C4 again and click OK. Now when Dodge is highlighted in the first column the list named Dodge appears in the second column. Right on down the line.","So we're going to take a look at how to make a drop-down box that Causes the contents of a second drop-down box to change using Excel The first thing that we need to do is determine what we're making our boxes with We're gonna use the example of cars Make these a little bit bigger and we'll just make a couple of headers here to make it easy to find where we're working Change the background color Our first our first column will be make our second column will be model keep it real simple C4 is where we're going to put our first drop-down box that's going to be for the make of the car.

Talk about basically two technologies from Brazil that are really impressive right now and it may sound like I'm showing up but I'm not. One thing I want to talk about is if it moves, now it's locked. Okay, so let's talk about the electronic fault in the land of the Amazon forest Brazil started adopting the electronic fault in 1996 that's when the process started in Brazil then by this the machine people tied the number to same means yes to means no And you can type the candidate number. By 2000, a hundred cities had electronic machines to collect votes. The people in the Amazon forest, the Indians living there, they have no electricity. People getting boats and taking the machines there, they will be able to vote and collect those things back to a central place where they could connect to the network and then do the counting for the voting. By 2011, We had a presidential election, 190,000 votes, 500,000 machines, and just to tell about the timeline, by 5 p.m. the voting stopped on the east coast. By 7, it was done on the west coast. By 8 p.m., 50 votes were out counted. By 11 p.m., we knew who the president was. It took four hours. Now, you guys can do that. just need to get to it. Federal tax return, another impressive thing for me. 1991, we started doing electronic tax returns in Brazil. They are the government supplies, the software to do the, your tax. It was a DOS program, and you would get these flop disks, do it at home, and go to the agency and give you to them. Here's my tax return, and they would put email in to process that. 1996 Windows was released by then 1997 50% of all tax were electronic 1997 1999 they can only be done and submitted online you can assume this paper but not 2004 was a Java program was available because people complain about I use Linux I cannot They don't force me to use Windows to run this. So they have a multi-platform available in 2011. You cannot do paper anymore. If you have to fill taxes, you have to do it internally. It's not allowed. So it's a big sponsor of open source software. They develop internal software. They release internally for the whole cities to use and companies to use. And it's starting to get better now with open data and open docs. and I think hopefully you're reflecting better lives for the proceedings. And that's what I have.

What gun did you use and I'm just like I honestly had no idea Nothing to tell him on how I got it. I told him just plain normal He would give one but he was asking for tips on stuff telling him right there I decided to make a video for it to help all of you who have got any moabs So just take note that I only have five moabs, but I should have more but I die on like 20 streaks but for tips for number one Use guns that you're good with don't use a class that everyone else uses cuz you may not be good with sick last Even though I want to give you the class I get my moabs with just in case you want to try it out, whatever. But that's tip one for me. But, and then, tip two, play smart. I'm being a complete hypocrite about this tip because I play like a complete, complete moron. But I still get them. But that's just most likely why I die on the good streaks. Because you gotta play smart. You gotta know where the enemy team is. You gotta know where to go, where your team is, what side of the map to play. Run support for you. Well, whatever if they're nice enough they could do that. Number five. Don't worry about your streak. I don't pay attention to my streak. My streak because it gets stressful and you worry a lot and will make more mistakes in your gameplay. Because you'll be like, oh my god, I'm on a 21. I am only three four kills away. Whatever it is, it's like a 24 kill streak, I think. It's like, oh my god, I'm only three away. Oh my god, I'm so close. And then, then when you Alright, can't hear a word right now. When you think you're close, you are close. You're gonna make more mistakes in your gameplay, so you're just gonna be like, oh my god. So then you're just gonna get angrier at the game, so just, just at least know you're close to it and continue to play smart during the game. Alright, number six. I don't know if you have this, but use a headset, alright? If you have one. This is just like a tip if you wanna do it. So I'm pretty much saying no to sound horror. I don't have one, but my score will probably increase I'm not sure if I would afford a headset, but I plan on getting one soon. The attachments are up to you. I usually use silencer and extended mag for ACR and then rapid fire and silencer for the MP7. I know, two guns that people hate. And then secondary, MP9. Whatever you're attaching, I usually use silencer and then perk once, scavenger pro because you start off with more mags, hardline, second perk, hardline pro because it helps you get assist, you can get your first perk easy. And three, dead silence because it will counter all headsets. users which could help you and then for specialist sleight of hand assassin stalker sleight of hand so you can reload quick and finish off those motherfuckers assassin so you're not on the radar stalker just so just so when you get it you can aim fast enough with it and this usually works well with the PP 90 and the P90 because the moab I got when he asked me for tips was with the PP 90 my first with the PP 90 so it should work it should all work with pretty much all those guns most assault rifles most Most sub machine guns, but don't take my word on it guys. I hope these tips help you to achieve your moab so yeah guys I will talk to you","What's up fishes? All right So this is a commentary on something that I was asked a while ago when I was playing some offer three Just for some Moab games, you know just so I could upload cuz I finally got my PVR hooked up will not hooked up yet But it will be but anyways, but when I finally got my first Moab the night one of my teammates asked How did you get it? What gun did you use and I'm just like I honestly had no idea Nothing to tell him on how I got it. I told him just plain normal He would give one but he was asking for tips on stuff telling him right there I decided to make a video for it to help all of you who have got any moabs So just take note that I only have five moabs, but I should have more but I die on like 20 streaks but for tips for number one Use guns that you're good with don't use a class that everyone else uses cuz you may not be good with sick last Even though I want to give you the class I get my moabs with just in case you want to try it out, whatever. But that's tip one for me. But, and then, tip two, play smart. I'm being a complete hypocrite about this tip because I play like a complete, complete moron. But I still get them. But that's just most likely why I die on the good streaks. Because you gotta play smart. You gotta know where the enemy team is. You gotta know where to go, where your team is, what side of the map to play. Run support for you, well whatever if they're nice enough they could do that Number five don't worry about your streak I don't pay attention to my streak my streaks because it gets stressful and you worry a lot and will make more mistakes in your gameplay Because you'll be like oh my god.

O regresso é uma primeira divisão, é sempre eliciente. O Câmara está no lugar onde deverá estar todos os anos porque é uma equipa que tem capacidade e é um clube que tem alguma história dentro da modalidade. que temos feito esta semana tem sido um trabalho mais duro, mais intenso, como é normal na pré-época mas penso que até agora está tudo bem, não há lesões que são mais importantes nesta fase inicial e esperamos de aqui a mais uma semana estarmos na melhor condição física possível para iniciar o campeonato. que teve o nome passado, muitos motivos de orgulho no Ocampatins Senior e Cama das Jovens. Este ano, como é que vai ser em termos de chamar a deputado João Pavilhão? Eu acho que a cidade de Valdecâmbara deve estar orgulhosa do Ocampatins porque não é fácil, em um clube com a idade que tenho o Câmbara, que são os anos, que já ganho uma taça de Portugal e a resta de séries de anos, penso eu, 6 ou 7 anos sem descer divisão, entre elite do OcA Nacional. Quando desceu, no ano seguinte, deu a resposta que deu, subiu e foi campeonational na segunda divisão. Não há outra maneira as pessoas em Vale Câmara estarem mais orgulhosas de nós neste momento, de que até agora. E o só espelho e peço é que nos venham a apoiar, que deixam um pavilhão, já tenho soldados a ver pavilhão cheio e gritar para o OcA. Entre os atletas estão muitas crianças que jogam aqui vocês são ídolos para essas crianças, não é? Sim, eu penso que sim, eu penso que qualquer miúdo numa fase inicial que é na modalidade as referências são jogadores sêneros, normalmente olham para os jogadores sêneros do seu plantel onde praticam modalidade e certeza absoluta que há jogadores aqui dentro que são referências para esses miúdos Para terminar, um desejo para estes próximos meses de competição.

We have done a lot of work this week, it has been a harder and more intense work, as is normal in the pre-season, but I think that everything is going well now, there are no more important injuries in this initial phase and we hope to be in the best physical condition possible to start the game. Do you accept this role? I accept it in the best way. I've been playing for a few years now, I'm part of this club for a few years now, and I've been playing for almost the same years as I was. We always try to integrate the best way, the reinforcements that come in the UNICEF, because they have to be able to have more difficulty. It's a normal feeling in the sport. I think the city of Valdecambra must be proud of the Ocampatinhas because it's not easy, in a club with the age of the Ocampanhas, who are 12 years old, to win a cup of Portugal. And the rest of the years, I think, is a great opportunity for the youth to be able to see the world. I've been playing for 6 or 7 years without leaving the national team. When I left, the next year I gave the answer that he left and was the national team in the second division. So I think there is no other way for people to play in the Valle de Câmara to be more proud of us at this moment than even now. I only expect and I ask that they support us, that they leave a light, that they have already sold out to a full light, to shout for the Academy of Camp. You are the idols for these kids, right? Yes, I think so. I think that any form of football in a first phase of football that is in the game, the references are the players. They usually look at the players of their squad, where they practice as a player, and it is certain that the players here are references to these games. To finish, a wish for the next months of competition. Many victories."

I met one of my buddies that I grew up with, referred me to Janie Bullard based on a wonderful experience he had at a resort called Capta Luka. He got married I think it's about seven or eight years ago now and he came back from his honeymoon at Capta Luka and described it to me and actually told me all about it. I knew that whenever I got married that's where I was going. I got engaged in 2009 and it was time to start cleaning a honeymoon. So then I contacted my buddy specifically to get the contact information for the travel agent that he used. And it was Janie Ballard at Distinctive Journey. I worked with Janie and described her what I wanted out of my honeymoon. And she worked me from the very beginning. She handed me all the different flight options and gave me all the literature that there is out there about Captain Luke. and then I was able to communicate to her what I wanted and she took that all into consideration and before I went to the actual honeymoon or even got married I got a package in the mail with all these, you know, basically my itinerary as well as these different vouchers or coupons if you will for different things down at the resort such as dinners and snorkeling events, massage which was pretty nice that happened I was there for 7 days and one of the neat things about it was that while I was down there, I actually ran into two people I knew already. One couple was down there on the honeymoon and the other couple was down there. That's just a regular vacation. During some of our visits we got to talking about comparing notes about what kind of deals each person had. It turned out that ours was, through distinctive journeys, was light years back. that have been with the other two couples that received when they had worked with the travel agents. I would say, this is the top of my head, but anywhere between two and three times the savings that the other couples had. And these savings included meals, and that's another thing that was great about this place is it gave us the opportunity to enjoy some really wonderful meals that would be normally very expensive and we were able to enjoy this for free. Anyway, so I got back, talked to Janie and told her about our wonderful experience and that's really about it. Since then we've been in contact. I get literature from her probably quarterly about other opportunities out there. You know, I've been married quite a year yet, but I know that going forward when it comes to a nice vacation like this, I'll be in contact with Janie at the Stinkal Trunks.","I just want to take a little bit of time and discuss my wonderful experience with distinctive journeys.

Hier soll es um das deutsche Team gehen und da das erst heute angekündigt wurde, heute am 12.03.2013 möchte ich dazu möglichst schnell das zusammen haben, weil es wäre so geil, wenn Deutschland gewinnt dieses Warwick Event. Und ich fasse erstmal das Wichtigste zusammen. Ein Team ist immer Nationale. Ja, dann es gibt, ihr könnt nur mit Free to Play Waffen zocken, also nur mit DINAR Waffen, kein Premium gelumpel, kein G1, äh Quatsch G1 Waffen, oh da war ich schon wieder in alten Zeiten, ah, nee Nexon ist besser, also keine Nexon Cash Waffen, nur alles, was ihr mit DINAR kaufen könnt, also, das ist ja ein ganz guter Waffen, aber ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Ahnung, ich habe noch keine Meine Idee ist, dass wir im offiziellen VAROG Global.com Forum Fred machen. Das habe ich schon erstellt. Das ist auch noch mal das wichtigste von meinen Ideen. Dass wir da diskutieren, welche Spieler wir erstmal in einem 24er Match gegeneinander zocken lassen. Wir wissen, maximal 12 Spieler heißt es wäre gut, wenn wir einen 24er Match machen und da die schlechtesten 12 raus senden, dann haben wir 12 gute Spieler oder eben 12 Leute, die gut zocken. Ich werde auf jeden Fall bei den 24er mit dabei sein. Sollte ich mich qualifizieren, werde ich davor natürlich noch ordentlich üben. Ja, wie gesagt, wir können ja in dem Thread, das ist auch unten eine Videobeschreibung verlinkt, ein bisschen weiter diskutieren. Wenn wir da in die 24er Brigade reinstellen, da würde ich sagen, machen wir dann so ein Match oder zwei oder drei am besten und da senden wir dann die schlechtesten 12 raus. Ja, was gibt es noch zu sagen? Wenn wir dann in den Games sind, Das ist der erste Mal. Die Debron geht auf die NIU, die NIU auf die Debron. Dann zocken sie nochmal sieben Runden. So können wir auf jeden Fall so Ungleichheiten von den Maps ausgleichen. Zum Beispiel, ich weiß ja nicht wie ihr das findet. Aber meiner Meinung nach hat die Debron auf NIU einen Nachteil gegenüber der NIU so was. Das ist jedenfalls meine Meinung. Es gibt natürlich noch andere Map wie manche empfinden, dass die NIU auf Carly total underpowered ist. und Ich werde dazu noch ein paar Videos machen. Also keine Sorge. Ihr werdet immer wieder informiert hier auf meinem Kanal auf LeafGamePlay2. Und wenn ihr da gar nichts verpassen wollt, abonniert das Video. abonniert einfach mal meinen Kanal für die Zeit, ihr könnt natürlich am Ende das Abo wieder wegmachen. Wenn ihr deutsche Warrock Freunde habt, teilt mit ihnen das Video einfach, würde mich sehr sehr freuen. Und das war es auch, wie gesagt, ihr findet alle Links in der Videobeschreibung. Ich bin raus, zockt ein bisschen Warrock und wir sehen uns dann, wenn es drauf ankommt. Bis dann, Over and out, Leaf Gameplay, Tschüss!","Welcome to this information video. Here at LeafGamplay2 I am talking about the Warwick ESL Country Championships 2013. Here is where the German team should go. Since the event was announced today at the 12th and 3rd in 2013 I want to have this event as soon as possible because it would be so cool if Germany wins this event. I will first talk about the most important thing. There is only one team and that is 6-12 players. If you are played, there are 4 players per team. My idea is to make a thread in our official VAROGLOBIL.com forum. I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of the level minimum, I don't think I have enough of I will be there at the 24th. If I qualify, I will practice a lot. As I said, we can discuss this in the Thread. If we put in the 24th Brigade, we will send the worst 12 out. So we should have done it so far that the event starts this country championship 2013 and we play against for example America then the team captains do that is determined beforehand I would say that the 12 of them decide then the team captain of that and that the some then put themselves on some map how is played and for seven rounds after that it is not over then the pages are changed so the The Daburon is on the Nu, the Nu on the Daburon. Then they play 7 rounds again. In any case we can compare the maps. For example I don't know how everyone thinks that. But in my opinion the Daburon has a disadvantage over the Nu. In my opinion there are other maps like some that are underpowered by the Nu. I think it's a bit overpowered, even though I think it's a bit of a dev match. It's not a dev match, it's a dev match. It's a dev match, it's a dev match. It's a dev match, it's a dev match. It's a dev match, it's a dev match. It's a dev match, it's a dev match. It's a dev match, it's a dev match.

I will make some videos about it, so don't worry, you will be informed about it. subscribe to my channel for the time you can of course delete the subscription at the end if you have German Warrock friends share the video with them I would be very very happy and that was it as I said you can find all links in the video description I'm out play a little Warrock and we'll see each other when it comes to it until then Over and out leave gameplay bye"

I'm gonna do an achievement guide for Beijing 2008 I've done an achievement guide before for pit boss achievement on one warfare 2, but Well, this is Beijing Olympics 2008. It's no game. Yes, but I recently picked up and I'm gonna start with kayaking kayaking my friends say and most achievement guides says the hardest one of the hardest achievements and basically I got the hang of it after a few tries. You have to really get used to the controls to be any good at this. You have to learn the course as well. So even if you're not good you can still go down the course, learn where the gates are, know where to turn, know when to turn, know how sharp to turn. And especially watch out for these backwards gates, which are really annoying. And I'm gonna say that if you're, for the backwards gates, try and go through a diagonal. so that you come out, so it's easy just to stick your aught in and spin round and carry on with a course. Now I missed a gate there, but, and look like that. Hit straight across at a diagonal and then I just floated down, stuck the aught in, and turned round. So much easier to do it that way, rather than trying to go straight through, I think I actually do this on one gate, but go straight through it, then try and turn yourself around, and then try and push yourself away from the gate sideways, and then I hit a gate for those who don't know, if you hit a gate you get plus 2 seconds on your time. You have to do it in under 112 seconds in total, including penalty time for the achievement. and all my friends seemed impressed by it so that's the kayaking done in 110 seconds which is my personal best and I believe there's judo next and judo's achievement is for winning the entire tournament without getting any points against you which means you're not allowed to get any yukos, kokos, wazahari or wazahari or ipons against you Basically, to win this easily, you'll learn the patterns. So I knew from when they started pushing, how shall I show you, you have to press the arrows when they appear. So I knew when we started going that way, they were going to be a right. So I pressed right. And I find the easiest one is to do is just tap Y as many times as you can. And then turn the controller so that the trigger is on the top and use all of your hands to just tap the triggers. I think I'll win this one as well. or doing something else which has a gauge where you choose wazze and you have to tap A as fast as you can to try and Ip on them which means 1 point in Japanese which means you win basically you win the match instantly with an Ip on or 2 wazze Aries and there's also a pin as well which is exactly the same as this you just have to tap the triggers as fast as you can Anyway, I find this the easiest way to win and that was the tournament over with achievement got. Next one 25 meter rapid fire pistol. This one is really easy. Basically for that, the bar goes by you have to get 5 10s in a row on one shot. So this one I don't think I get it. My friends covered it up by inviting me to play Mono Warfare 2. No, I got a nine in there, but once you get if you get breathing excellent It's really easy like they're got five tens sorted this one's juggling throw if you notice there It's actually my second attempt when I'm doing this because I fouled the first one by accident and you have to throw it over 98.6 I do believe for this one and my tip for this is just waggle it as fast as you can hold down hold the stick right up until it's locked and then just get it So you stop dead on the line because on that one I didn't actually make it, 93 I think. But this one, you want to get the angle as close to 45 as you can possibly get and as close to the line without going over for a foul. And this one I think I get a 43 degree angle and stop dead on the line, which is pretty much perfect. My world record now is 98. 8.8 something and this nearly beats it I think it's like three centimeters or so short of the world record so but It's still a good throne. I'm guessing a bit easy to beat for some of you guys But that's it for this achievement guide. I hope you enjoy it. Hope you use it Hope you like it if you want more achievement guides for some games or ones that you're stuck on Send me a message or leave me a comment down below I do read them and if you subscribe then they make them up I'll try and make a video and try and help get around to everything you want I'm gonna be working on a montage soon for modern warfare 2 and I hope you guys, I hope to see you guys next time see you later","Hey guys, I thought I'd do something a little different today. I'm gonna do an achievement guide for Beijing 2008 I've done an achievement guide before for pit boss achievement on one warfare 2 but Well, this is Beijing Olympics 2008. It's no game. Yes, but I recently picked up and I'm gonna start with kayaking kayaking my friends say and most achievement guides says the hardest one of the hardest achievements and basically I got the hang of it after a few tries. You have to really get used to the controls to be any good at this. You have to learn the course as well. So even if you're not good you can still go down the course, learn where the gates are, know where to turn, know when to turn, know how sharp to turn. And especially watch out for these backwards gates which are really annoying. And I'm gonna say that if you're, for the backwards gates, try and go through a diagonal. so that you come out, so it's easy just to stick your aught in and spin round and carry on with the course. Now I missed the gate there, but, and look like that. Hit straight across at a diagonal and then I just floated down, stuck the aught in and turned round. So much easier to do it that way, rather than trying to go straight through, I think I actually do this on one gate, but go straight through it, then try and turn yourself around and then try and push yourself away from the gate sideways and then I'm actually hitting a gate there, if you hit a gate, for those who don't know, I've never played this before, if you hit a gate you get plus 2 seconds on your time. You've got to do it in under 112 seconds in total, including penalty time, for the achievement. And actually this is my personal best on this one. But even with a penalty I'd do it under the time, and if you miss a gate, so if you just go straight past it, it's deeper. and all my friends seemed impressed by it so that's the kayaking done in 110 seconds which is my personal best and I believe there's judo next and judo's achievement is for winning the entire tournament without getting any points against you which means you're not allowed to get any yukos, kokos, wazahari or wazahari or ipons against you Basically, to win this easily, you'll learn the patterns. So I knew from when they started pushing, how shall I show you, you have to press the arrows when they appear. So I knew when we started going that way they were going to be a right. So I pressed right and I find the easiest one is to do is just tap Y as many times as you can and then turn the controller so that the trigger is on the top and use all of your hands to just tap the triggers. I think I'll win this one as well. or doing something else which has a gauge where you choose waz-a, you have to tap A as fast as you can to try and Ip on them which means one point in Japanese which means you win basically you win the match instantly with an Ip on or two waz-a-aries and there's also a pin as well which is exactly the same as this you just have to tap the triggers as fast as you can Anyway, I find this the easiest way to win. And that was the tournament over with achievement got. Next one 25 meter rapid fire pistol. This one is really easy. Basically for that, the bar goes by, you have to get 5 10s in a row on one shot. So this one I don't think I get it. My friends covered it up by inviting me to play Mono Warfare 2. No, I got a nine in there, but once you get if you get breathing excellent It's really easy like they're got five tens sorted this one's juggling throw if you notice there It's actually my second attempt when I'm doing this because I fouled the first one by accident and you have to throw it over 98.6 I do believe for this one and my tip for this is just waggle it as fast as you can hold down hold the stick right up until it's locked and then just get it So you stop dead on the line because on that one I didn't actually make it, 93 I think.

Jeg vil egentlig også starte med at sige, at jeg gjorde det. Og også det videoen handler om, det er faktisk også det, der har gjort, at jeg kunne gøre det, fordi jeg gjorde det. Det er fordi jeg har længe gået at tænke på, eller jeg har sagt jeg har faktisk tænkt på nu igennem års tid nu, faktisk skirk her. Jeg har ikke haft det hele for tæmmere sammen, for så har jeg så glemt det igen. Men i dag var jeg lige nede i en timstid. Jeg synes faktisk, der var rigtig hyggeligt, så det er noget, jeg skal have gjort et par gange om ugen. Så kan jeg sikre, at man også kan blive frivilligere ned. Det kunne i hvert fald blive ganske cool. Det er jo i hvert fald også noget, at se frem til. og jeg ville blive noget for andre mennesker, så det er også noget jeg rigtig er glad for. Og det gjorde så også, at da jeg så kom hjem, så kunne jeg selvfølgelig se på de kommentarer, der var kommet til min video om, at jeg ikke følte mig hjem på den her kanal. Der var der sådan en enkel kommentar, der sådan set rigtig sprenge over øjnene, og jeg gik og tænkte på det, synes jeg ikke omkring, at jeg kunne tage 20 minutter og sætte, jo, jeg tror kraftigt, at jeg gør det. Hvilken kommentar er eller hvilken kanal er min beslutning og min overvejelse, så det hele er fastlagt. Jeg starter forfra på en ny kanal, så kan folk kalde det i Lukas Nilsen eller hvad pakker jeg ved. Jeg har tøndes til nærmest ligeglad. Jeg synes jeg trækker til at have en helt ny frisk start, hvor jeg starter fra Scratch. Det er kun to af mine bedste venner, og så en som har fuldt målitsinde, at jeg startede med hyggen 6 al. da jeg ved, hvad det er for en kanal. Så det er så de tre mennesker, eller de tre personer, som jeg så starter med. Jeg har allerede oprette kanalen, den er så skjul nu. Jeg gør så også det, at jeg har Jeg er på... Nu her i løbet af næste uge. Der tager jeg os sletter den her kanal. Og så lader jeg mig opdag igen. Så vil jeg heller bruge tid på det, plus at jeg så laver en ny stin, hvor jeg så også køber ny spil. Sådan så, at jeg ikke har gået rundt i det samme. Og selvfølgelig min Xbox Live. Det blev selvfølgelig også lavet om, så det er jo ikke lige frem den største hergaver. Og så vil jeg så bare langsomt bygge min nye spilsamling op, da jeg sådan lige nuværende har jo fat i mange spil. Jeg er faktisk aldrig nu sine spiller. Så det er sådan set det, der kommer til at køre, og så plever min fansider på Facebook, de vil også plive slet. Jeg ved ikke om jeg kommer til at oprette en fansid igen. Nu skal jeg lige have bygget det nye fanbase op. Som er det navn jeg har fundet. Det tror jeg helt sikkert nok, at det skal nok blive godt når jeg så pæde opdaget igen. Jeg vil selvfølgelig ikke sige, hvad det er. Så er det næsten, som jeg siger. Vi har fået en brev her fra Herbert, Marianne, Hansen og Gamlevand og Nye. Og det synes jeg ikke. Det er jo så rigtigt nogle nye start. Jeg fik det næsten med den her kanal, fordi der var ikke særlig mange fra Høgingsuniverset, der rykket bagover, sådan hvad jeg kunne se. Men jeg synes da lige vel, at jeg har succes med den her kanal, og det kan jeg jo sige kun tak alt jeg ser for. Men jeg synes bare ikke, at det er holdbart i længden, når man ikke føler sig hjemme i den navn og selve kanalen. Jeg har faktisk mig heldere med ud om, hvorfor og hvordan og bl.b.b. Så har folk i hvert fald en forståelse for det, inden jeg gør dem. Og nu i og med, at du er subscriber eller ser mine videoer, så vil du i hvert fald vide, når du har set den her video om, hvorfor jeg slettet min kanal i løbet af næste uge og arbejder på den kanal, som du selvfølgelig ikke kender i nu, så må du bare prøve at se, om du ikke kan finde mig igen. Det glæder mig også til at komme til at arbejde med igen, fordi som regel er det også meget nemt at sige for mig, når folk spørger om røget, hvordan man skal gøre det med den kanale. Jeg havde succes inden jeg hovedet begyndte at starte med at vide om hyggen i MA. Jeg er bare lettere kendt inden for det Xbox Live form, Så det var jo lidt af en succes, så jeg har jo ikke prøvet at starte fra scratch, hvis man skal sige det sådan. Og det er så også derfor, at jeg har valgt at sige, at nu vil jeg prøve at plive opdagede igen, med et navn, jeg synes, jeg kan identifisere mig med. Så det skal nok plive spændende at se, hvordan det så kommer til at køre om, hvordan min fanbase så pliver. Tak fordi du har vælt og kiggede med. Og så vil jeg selvfølgelig også tak alle jer ser og alle jer subscriber på den her kanal. Så fordi det er jo også jeg, der har været med til at gøre, at jeg har kunne komme op på 1100 views om dagen i snit. Og det er selvfølgelig også rigtigt glade for. Og det svære følger mig bare rigtig hjemme i kanalen, så I skal have rigtig stor tak. Hvis du skal have et på gensyn, hvis du finder min kanal, så skal du i hvert fald have et på gensyn. Så jeg vil i hvert fald slå det af herfra og så ønsker dig en fortsat god aften og en god jakt, hvis du kommer til lige efter min profil. Men den kommer først live fredag på et tidspunkt. Så det er ingen grund til lige før fredag. Men som sagt, det er sådan set... Det er ikke min beslutning. Så kan man selvfølgelig også sige, at på min steam har jeg selvfølgelig for mange 100 kr. og spil mig til. Ja, og jeg spiller dem jo alligevel ikke jo. Så derfor har jeg tænkt, at man så tager bare en frisk ny start, hvor jeg så siger, at man så er det simpelthen nogle af mine spillere, som jeg må købe igen. Og så er det så også en ny spill, jeg så også skulle købe. Og så er det jo noget helt nyt, så kommer til at ske fra og med næste fredag. Så... Hej!","Hi and welcome to this channel's last video. I want to start by saying that I didn't do it. And also the video is about, it is actually also that I did it. That I could do it because I did it. It's because I have not been thinking about, or I have actually thought about it now, through the years now, actually share here. I have been thinking about coming to the real world, which is actually me, about 20 minutes away. But I have never really understood the whole thing, because I have forgotten it again. But today I was just down in the middle of the time, and I actually think it was really nice, so it's at least something I have to do a couple of times a week. And then I can also make time to be free to go down, so it could at least be quite cool. So it's at least something to look forward to, because then I can also I was left with something from other people, so that's something I'm really happy about. And it also made me come home. I could also see the comments that were coming to my video about me not coming home on this channel. There was a comment that was really scared in my eyes, and I thought about it for about 20 minutes, and I thought, I think it's really strong. I don't know which channel is my decision and my selection is completely fixed. I start from a new channel so people can call it Lukas Nielsen or whatever I think is the most pleasant. Because I think I need to have a brand new start where I start from scratch. There are only two of my best friends and one who has followed me since I started with Hygge 6 Alfaerys, who know what a channel is. So these are the three people that I started with and I have already opened the channel, it is so scary now. And I also do that I'm here running for the next week. I'm taking the channel and then I'm letting myself update again. So I'd rather spend time on that plus I'm making a new stone where I also buy new games so that I don't hack around in the same and of course my Xbox Live I also did some things, so it's not the biggest thing I do. And then I will just slowly build my new game collection. When I have so many games, I have never really played them. So that's what I will do. And then my fans on Facebook will also be happy. I don't know if I will ever be able to make a fan base again. I think it will be enough when I get the update. I don't want to say what it is. We have received a letter from Herbert Marjann Hansen who wants to be new. I got it almost with this channel because there was not much from the Høgens University back then, as you could see. But I think I have succeeded with this channel and I can only thank you for that. But I don't think it's sustainable in the long run when you don't feel at home in your name and your own channel. I am actually more concerned about how and how and blah blah blah. So people have at least a understanding of it before I do it. And now, in the meantime, if you are a subscriber or watch my videos, then you will at least know when you see this video about why I deleted my channel in the course of next week and worked on this channel that you of course do not know now, then you just have to see if you can find me again. I'm also looking forward to work with them again. As a rule it's also very nice to tell people about me when they ask me about how to do it with another channel. I had success in my head at the beginning with a real video with the hygen. I was just easily familiar with the Xbox Live form. So it was a success, so I haven't tried to start from scratch. And that's also why I have chosen to say that now we will try to stay updated again. With a name I think I can identify with. So it should be enough to stay excited to see how it will turn out. Thank you so much for choosing to watch this channel. I would also like to thank all my viewers and subscribers for watching this channel. It is also me who has been able to come up with 1100 views in a day. I am really happy for that. It is hard to feel at home in the channel. I would like to thank you very much. If you want to have a good view of my channel, you should have a good view of my channel. I want to end here and then I wish you a good evening and a good hunt if you come to my channel after my profile. But it will be live Friday at a tea time. So it's not a reason to wait for Friday. I don't have my own decision, because I can also say that on my steam I have to pay a lot of money to play with things, yes, and I play them all the time, but not really. So that's why I think, I just take a fresh new start, where I say, then it's just some of my games that I have to buy again, and then it's also new games that I have to buy, and then it's something completely new, So, next Friday, I will be going to Skifrager.com. Bye!"

Yes my dear, you're bragging, but I still like your little fjord. In this middle there are homos, olive oil pots, they say they are big shots while they like to be remembered. It's a jooler, they still do it, they all have taken it. It's not true, they're not good at it, they're blah blah, it's fiction. Why do they rebel? They want to copy when they have. Maybe to hit women, but they don't have the right to be in the Glamour. To go through a big radio, rappers are too much for the deck. Like a bullfighter, to be taken by my necks. The kids want to make a career, like to touch their fucking. Better to kill your mother, you're like a fucking. The old ones are too stupid, so the rain is going to be a tragedy. They should have stopped the rain, like the career of Saïd. They all have the same ideas, so the disc will fly too low. The worst is that they find each other too beautiful, while they are like a dog. Some think they will lose well, they have the Rima Raqiri. But their flow is useless, like the Zahiri dribs. They pretend to be a sonan, just because they insult your mother. But they are so violent, that a attack from Francis Leazer. It's a shame that they don't see anything, it's a shame that they are so stupid, and they are so stupid, but they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they are so stupid, they A priori, they don't know tomorrow, they'll find a JPP The rappers sell me an album that has a supporter in Louis II It's not wrong to make a comeback, they are so vain Look at their face there, who looks like Jerome Rotten The phoenixes are so pale, it's stuff like the M The arctic is no longer the gennaker of a round, and yet there are some who walk March the world's champions, there was well Stéphane Givache The Wacken, if Rakaïe, made sound at the front They wear small kamaeus, and feminine like the Slant They say they have big lips, like it's a conda I don't even listen to their Foskeld, these bidon like Shibonda I think they should wear the full A if they have 2-3 supporters it's the same as this Zoubar in the clip of the girls who never pined me these idiots like the beef, as much as you humiliate I don't know if rap is dead, what about those who are racist? in this middle of the doors, fiascoes like Alphéradi the hippo of France is without a sound like the french FA they aim the song of the champions but at the level of the FA the MCs need the R&B to get some badlames they flirt with their enemies and exchange teams like Graveln there would be by the radios such Jerome the king in blue they make some lies for the adults We don't care about the carambu, Fredo, congratulations, he doesn't deserve it. There is a technical deficit, worse than Jérémie Clément, in the game, only impostors, in the kind of appoulant help. Either you go for a Osler, or you go for a ZML.

Dat gebeurde nadat de Explosieve Oepruimingsdienst van Defensie de ontsteking had verwijderd. De omgeving is weer vrijgegeven. De Britse 250 ponder uit de Tweede Wereldoorlog kwam tevoorschijn bij bouwwerksaamheden voor een nieuwe parkeergarage aan het kruisplein. Na de fondst werd in overleg met de Explosieve Oepruimingsdienst Defensie het autotrem, metro en busverkeersstil gelegd. Ook werd de ingang van het centralsstation afgesloten. De doelen, het conservatorium, de partebioscoop en het Manhattan Hotel hoefden niet te worden ontruimd. Wel moest de hotelgast staan aan de kant van het plein even van hun kamers af. Bewoners van Fletsch vlakbij de bouwpunt kregen het advies om niet bij hun ramen te gaan staan. Wat gebeurt er dan als ik vraag mag? Nou, ze gaan een bom onschadelijk maken, maar dan moet je eerst alles ontruimd hebben. O, kijk eens, gewoon een test, zeg maar. Nee, er is licht een bom in de parkeergereis en twee wereldoorlogbom, ja. Zodat? Ja? Nou, beter afstand nemen, hè? Ja, ik zou maar doen. Ja, daar gaan we maar even verder. Oké. Het is goed. Rond half 11 maakte de EOD de bom onschadelijk door een zogenoemde raketklemp te gebruiken. Het gaf een bescheide klap. Na deze kleine explosie kon het projectiel uit de bouwput worden getakeld en op een vrachtwagen afgevoerd. Waarschijnlijk wordt de bom vrijdag op een afgelegen plek tot ontploffing gebracht.","The aircraft bomb that was found in a building on the cross-strait in Rotterdam was damaged and destroyed. That happened after the explosion service of the defense had removed the evidences. The area has been freed again. The British 250 pounder from the Second World War came to appear at construction companies for a new parking garage on the cross-strait. After the collapse, the car, tram, metro and bus traffic was still in place with the explosion service. The entrance of the central station was also closed. The goals, the conservatory, the pathébioscope and the Manhattan hotel... ...were not to be cleared. The hotel guests had to leave their rooms on the side of the square. The residents of Fletch got the advice to not stand in their rooms. What happened? They're going to make a bomb, but first they have to clear everything. So they just have to test it? No, there's a bomb in the parking lot. A bomb? A two-way bomb. Really? Yes. Better to take a break. I'll do it. We're going to go back. Okay. Good. Around 11.30 the EOD made the bomb harmless by using a so-called rocket clamp. It gave a sharp slap. After this small explosion the projectile could be taken out of the building and carried off on a freight train. Probably the bomb will be delivered to a place on a remote location on Friday."

Das von der EU geförderte Projekt ""Blicke wechseln - Sinne wandeln"" hat Blinde und Sehende zusammen gebracht und mit Ihnen ein Fotoprojekt realisiert. Ziel war es herauszufinden, wie unterschiedlich die Welt wahrgenommen werden kann. Blinde oder sehbehinderte Menschen nutzen verstärkt ihre anderen Sinne, wie das Tasten oder Hören und haben so einen anderen Eindruck von der Welt, als Menschen die die Welt zu einem großen Teil visuell wahrnehmen. Dieser Umstand wurde hier beleuchtet.  Die Austellung befindet sich ab dem 13.4.2012 im FINCAN - Altenbraker Straße 26, 12051 Berlin-Neukölln.","carpeberlin, sehbehinderte, Blicke wechseln sinne wandeln, FINCAN, Foto, Ausstellung, Kunst, Dirk Sorge, Blinde, Fotografie, Silja Korn, Lisa Müller",519,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/4A5-BfqfgZc.mp3,"Ich bin Lisa, ich bin aus dem Team von Rick Gewexel in Sinne Wandeln und ich habe das zusammen mit vier anderen Berliner in der Pandemie zit. Die Idee ist eigentlich ziemlich banal. Also es ging, im Endeffekt haben wir uns die Frage gestellt, was sieht man, wenn man nicht sieht, oder wenn man nur eingeschränkt sieht und was übersieht man oder sieht man eben nicht, wenn man sieht und wir haben versucht, das mit fotografischen Mitteln anzugeben und mit diesem Mediumfotografie Ich gehe meistens, wenn ich ein Foto mache, nach Geräuschen und nach Empfindungen und was ich rieche und so und höre. Und da konnte ich manchmal Sachen nicht wahrnehmen, weil ich die nicht gehört habe und auch nicht gebrochen habe. Und da ziemlich darauf aufgewachsen gemacht. Und das war auch so der Sinn der Sache. Dass wir praktisch zu zweit einen Sehner und ein Blinder durch die Straßen von Berlin gehen sollten. Und dann habe ich ein Bild praktisch nachgemaht, Das ist auch so eine Leinwand, wo ich praktisch ein Foto versucht habe, nachzumachen. Weil ich sonst künstlerisch auch tätig bin, ich male nämlich auch. Und das habe ich versucht, was da auf dem Bild ist, diese abtragte Fotografie nachzunfinden. Das mache ich noch hier auch. Wenn ich raus ein Tisch und da werde ich dann versuchen, wenn Leute wollen ein Foto, dann können sie sich nehmen in die Hand und dann mir beschreiben, was sie dort sehen. Und ich versuch das dann nachzumachen. Jonas Hauer, mein Kollege, der ist Musiker. Wir haben uns überlegt, wie Bewegungen verschieden sinnlich wahrgenommen werden können. Er kannte halt als blinder Pianist, kannte er Bewegungen in Bildern überhaupt nicht. Also er konnte sich gar nicht vorstellen, wie im Video zum Beispiel Bewegungen dargestellt wird. Er kannte nur Klangentwicklungen, wie der Musiker das Klang gemacht hat, über eine Zeit, eine Zeitspanne, die sich entwickeln muss. Das haben wir uns überlegt, wie man das irgendwie einmal akustisch darstellen kann und dann auch noch visuell und dann auch noch durch die Haptik. Die Haptik ist halt in dem Fall, dass wir gemacht haben, so eine Tasten vom Klavier, die sich bewegen. Das heißt, die Tasten werden haptisch runtergedrückt. Man kann visuell sehen, wie sie runtergehen und man kann akustisch hören, wie der Ton, der Akkord erzeugt wird. Und das haben wir in einem Stop-Motion-Verfahren als Video gemacht. Wir haben 25 Einzelwäder geschossen von der Bewegung. und haben die in einer Sekunde Video zusammen diskutiert. Das läuft jetzt hier im Endpläts-Log als Videoprojektion. Also ich habe mit der, durch die Arbeit mit Jonas habe ich eben gemerkt, wie wichtig mir die gesuelle Wahrnehmung noch ist. Ich habe halt noch einen See Rest, den auch relativ gut ist im Vergleich mit den anderen Seebeinderten. Ich habe dann wieder gemerkt, wie extrem visuell ich immer noch drauf finde, obwohl ich halt weiß, ich werde irgendwann blind sein. Das ist eigentlich eine komische Situation, sind wir sehr visuell. Ich habe gemerkt, Jonas ist fast vom Geburt an blind. Er macht alles ganz anders. Er hat sich überlegt, bei den Tasten runterdrücken kann er nicht schauen, wie tief sind die Tasten gedrückt, sondern er muss eben fühlen und sich im System bauen, die irgendwie so eine Präzision zulassen, die man gar nicht sehen kann, sondern die man halt nie mehr durch Mechanik erzeugen kann. Das finde ich sehr spannend.","I'm Lisa, I'm from the team of Rieke Wexel in Sinnewandel and I have organized this with four other Berliners. The idea is actually pretty trivial. In the end we asked ourselves what you see if you don't see it, if you only see it restricted and what you see or don't see if you see it. We tried to give it to photographers in the middle and with this medium photography I usually go to the recording studio to make a photo, to listen to the sounds and to hear what I hear. Sometimes I couldn't perceive things because I didn't hear them and didn't smell them. I did that on purpose and it was also the sense of the matter. We had to go to the streets of Berlin to see and to see the things. Then I made a picture and I drew it. You have to see it, it's a canvas where I tried to take a photo afterwards. Because otherwise I'm an artist, I'm painting. And that's what I tried to do, what's on the picture, to find this abstract photographic reference. I do that here too. When I'm outside a table, I try to take a photo if people want to, and then I describe what they see there. And I try to take it afterwards. Jonas Hauer, my colleague, is a musician. We thought about how movements can be perceived in a different sense. He knew how to play as a piano player. He knew how to play in pictures. He didn't know how to play in video, for example. He only knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound.

He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. He knew how to play in sound. We thought about how to make it acoustic and then also visually and then also through the Haptic. The Haptic is in this case a keyboard keyboard that moves. That means keys are pressed down. You can see visually how they go down and you can hear how the sound, the chord is generated. And we did that in a stop motion video. We shot 25 1-CVs of the movement. and they recorded a video in a second. This is the end of the video. Through the work with Jonas I noticed how important my personal perception is. I have a very good rest and I have noticed how I still find it extremely personal. Although I know I will be blind. I realized that Donas is almost like a birthmark. He does everything differently. He thinks about pressing down the buttons. He doesn't look down, but he has to feel and build a system that allows him to make a decision that you can't see at all, but that you can create by mechanics. I find that very exciting."

Красивое имя, говорила я, еврейское, говорил папа. И рассказывал мне библейскую историю про персидскую царицу Истер, любимую жену Артек Серкса, который жил в сказочном дворце роскошь и богатство и уже начала забывать, кто она и откуда. Пока в один не совсем прекрасный день. Весь наш народ может погибнуть, Злой Аман задумал истребить всех евреев. Ты одна может спасти нас всех, Иди к царю и скажи, что Аман подлец. Но я не могу в эти к царю без разрешения Меня могут казнить, Девочка моя, Иначе казнят нас всех, Надо попытаться, Ведь ты одна из нас. Надо рискнуть, даже если я часто представляю себя на месте той, Эстер. Именно в эти минуты. Быть богатой царицей в чужой стране или пойти на смерть ради народа, к судьбе которого ты только что прикоснулась. Какие чувства боролись в ней? Почему победил этот веками непокоренный еврейский дух? И что все-таки значит эти слова? Виты одна из нас. с которыми я ступаю, такие знакомые камни. И эта стена, святая стена, стена плача, прикасаюсь к нелбом, кладу на нее руки, закрываю глаза. И неведомое село поднимает меня над этой стеной, над маслянечной горой, над золотым Ярусалимом, над маленькой огромной страной, поднимает и несет История, которая проникает в мою память. История, побед и трагедий. История, гордости и веры. Бестрашие и решимости. Через время я чувствую эту решимость. Решимость наших пророков. Решимость СТР. Решимость защитников массады, которые так и не покорились Рымлянам. Тесечи защитников этой крепости, осажденные и безоружные, выбрали добровольную смерть, но не сдались, не стали рабами. Все как один. Все как... Одна. Что значит быть одной из нас? Глядя через время, тот же вопрос задаю я себе. Помните древние библейские книги? Или просто танцевать с незнакомыми людьми на набережной Талявиво? Танцевать взявшись за руки. Вдыхать в прохладный воздух в субботне молитвы в Ярусалимской синагоге? и с прекрасного источника Энгеди, который пил еще царь Саламон, когда сочинял самую лиричную песню о любви. Песень песни. А может это значит просто сказать Шалом, приветливому еврею из Аргентины, которого ты встречишь на узкой улочке древнего Явла? А может это все-таки значит держать вместе с братом Ёмкипор и ждать, когда в этот день запоюд к Лнидрей? Самую красивую еврейскую молитву. как зоноза врезается в память.

And told me a biblical story about the Persian queen Esther, the beloved wife of the Orthodox Church, who lived in a fabulous palace of luxury and wealth and already began to forget who she was and where she was from. The whole nation may die. The evil Aman thought and killed all the Jews. You alone can save everyone. Go to the king and say that Aman is a traitor. But I can't go to the king without permission. I can be punished. My girl. Otherwise, everyone will be punished. We must try. After all, you are one of us. I must risk even if I often imagine myself in the place of that Esther. It is in these minutes that a rich queen from a foreign country or go to death for the people, to the fate of which you have just touched. What feelings fought in her? Why did this century defeated the Jewish spirit? And what does this word mean? Why did she go? She went and saved. Why? I remember how the first time I flew here. A dense, hot air burned my face. Such a familiar air. Abyssinia trees stretched branches from the white clouds. Such familiar branches. Glands, rubbed with time stones. I walk with my hands, I touch with my hands, I put my hands on it, I close my eyes, and my unknown strength rises above this wall, above the oil mountain, above the golden Jerusalem, above the small, huge country, rises and carries the He takes you to the high mountain where Abraham was dedicated to the priest and began our history. The history that penetrates into my memory. The history of victory and tragedy. The history of pride and faith. Fearlessness and determination. After a while I feel this determination. The decision of our prophets, the decision of Esther, the decision of the defenders of the Mossads, who did not so much to the Romans. Thousands of defenders of this fortress, besieged and armed, chose a voluntary death, but did not give up, did not become slaves. All as one, all as one. One. What does it mean to be one of us? from the beautiful source of Engedy, which drank the king Solomon, when he started the most lyrical song of love. Song, song. Or maybe it means just saying hello to my Jew from Argentina, who will meet you on the narrow street of ancient Asia. Or maybe it means to stay with the brother of Yom Kippur and wait for the next day to sing to the Nidra. The most beautiful Jewish prayer is so much to know. To be one of us. I went to the synagogue to learn the Jewish prayer myself. I went to read the Holy Torah together with the Ravine, the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the first words of the The sound of the tongue and the clink of the letters, As the nose cuts into memory.

Δεν θα πεις κακή κουβέντα για τον άρχοντα του λαού σου. Μάλιστα με την ευκαιρία θα σας πω και ένα μικρό παράδειγμα πάνω σε αυτό. Ο Απόστολος Παύλος έλειπε από την Παλεστήνη χρόνια χρόνια πολλά. όταν κάποτε ήλθε και συνελήφθηκε έγιναν κοινισφασερίες και τα λοιπά, την ώρα που απελογεί το στο συνέατριο αντελήφη ότι κάποιος έστηλε κάποιον και του δωσε ένας καπίλης το πρόσωπο. Όπως το λογος Παύλος. Παρετήρησε ποιος ήταν εκείνος, γνωρίζε να ξέρει ποιος ήταν. Τότε στρέφεται προς εκείνον και του λέγει τίχε και κονιαμένε μέλη σε τίπτην ο Θεός. Είναι στις πράξεις αυτό, του βάρει ασπρισμένου. Έτσι θα σε εκτυπήσει ο Θεός. Του λέγουν, τον αρχιαρέα του Θεού ήδωρεις ήδωρο θα πει κατύγο ρόγοι, βρύζω! Ποιον, τον αρχιαρέα του Θεού, αδελθεί δεν το εγνώρι. Και ζήτησε συγνώτου. Και εκεί σημειώνει το ευλειό των πράξεων διότι ο νόμος λέγει, άρχοντα λαού σου οικερίς κακό. Τέλειο, σε πάει. Δεν μπορείς να φρίζεις εκείνο που σου διεκεί. Μα θα μου πείτε ήταν αυτός ο δίξος ο μίξος. Αχ, κονταλαούς σου, ούκαιρεις κακό σου. Θυμηθείτε τον καλιά. Λείσαι μέρα να μιλήσεις, λέει, στον Χριστόν. Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω την εξουσία να σε ελευθερώσουν, να σε καταδικάσουν. Όχι λέει. Δεν θα είσαι καμία εξουσία επάνω μου. Εάν δεν σου είχε αντοδεί, άνω θεω. Από το Θεό.

And God will rule the young ones, like the original one. God will rule the young ones of the nation. God will rule the nation, the nation, the country, the country of the parents. And God will rule the young ones of the nation. Do you see the difference? The most powerful child of the apostasy. And it creates, as is very natural, the phenomenon of social distancing. A society that initially lives in a distance, because of the fact that it is certain that it is certain that it has a certain distance. This person is connected to himself. He is connected to society. What is society? You will be shocked. Or the colonial society. Because the wealth of the human resources that develops the distance, the authority and the foundation is the colonial one. That is why in other times and they developed these phenomena, but only with loneliness. Today, however, there is a mystery, these are discovered. We never forget it. How does the Holy Bible see the energy? It sees it as a very strong symbol of the established man. And it is actually a good, well-designed society, and it is forced to be based on the principles that govern this society. The old tradition is already in the context of this. I will tell you where it is characteristic. It says, the people are coming, or you are coming bad. I will not say a word about the people coming. Again, with the opportunity, I will tell you a small example of this. Apostle Paul was missing from Palestine for many years. When he came and became a priest, he decided that someone sent him a letter to the priest. As Pavlos said, he recognized who he was, without knowing who he was. Then he ran to him and said, what happened to him? He was shocked. This is in practice, eh? The heavy burden. This is how God will express himself. They call him the Archangel of God, the God, the God, the God, I will say something, I am afraid! Who? The Archangel of God? Brother, he does not know him. And he asked for forgiveness. And that is where the reward of the action is realized, because the law says, your people come either bad or bad. You cannot be afraid of that person as you are. But you tell me, was he the right or wrong? You have your people, you are not bad. Do you remember the Kaya? You said that you do not speak to Christ. Do you not know that I have the power to free you? No, you will not have any power above me if God had given you. I mean, listen to this. How does Apostle Pavlos, with a clear conscience, in his last letter, in the 13th chapter, I will read to you, however, a part of the text. What is it? What is it? What is it? A place. I was told to be a good man. I was wrong. But think that God's love was to be proved by the same God as the people. It was to be proved by a man who was a saduk. He didn't believe in God. And by a servant. That's why Christ said, you will not have power if you were not given in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the power of God, in the The idea of the throne is that the crime is being committed. Those who oppose it will be punished. Who is that? God. The garrarchs who are afraid of the workmen but the evil. Because what the archers say is not the fear of the workmen but the good man who will be affected by the evil. Do you want to scare the power of the evil? You say you are not afraid of the power? Do good, support the laws. You will be rewarded for that. And you will be rewarded for that. God is the devil, the state of the loved ones. Because he is the devil of the government. Now I repeat myself again, because God is the one who is responsible for the evil. I repeat myself again. If you are not a evil person, fear. We thank God. Let's see. The evil man is the one who fights. and the way to put it in the middle of the circle, so that it does not interfere with it.

The rest of it you just get this sort of white noise, ambient noise in the background, you know like water running, things like that. And it's really unsettling. Now speaking of those bear traps, you will die horribly a lot throughout this game. One of the main causes is those bloody bear traps. And this brings me to my next point. It's a very gory It's rated in 18, I thought it was unusual for an animated game but then I saw the devastation that one of those better traps causes to name a few. There's many ways to die throughout this game. Other things, gameplay. No instructions whatsoever. You were just literally flung into limbo and said get on with it and you have to figure it out from there, which I quite liked. Now the achievements. You get achievements for finding these little tiny eggs throughout the whole game and some of them are pain in the ass. asked to find. And this is my main gripe with this. If you fully complete the game, you get the biggest achievement, you get the 100 point achievement, which is great, and you deserve it, definitely. However, there is another achievement that if you die less than five times throughout the whole thing, which if you've played limbo, you know how much of a bugger that is to do, you get 10 points. I just think that's unfair. Anyway, so really, if you haven't played limbo, at all, give it a go. I mean, hey, just go buy it right now, if you haven't played it because you love it, and you'll hate it at the same time. I now understand what my friend Rob said to me, which he advised, have someone nearby that you can punch really hard. Because after you've tried to do the same sequence five, ten, twenty times, you need someone there to take it out on. Or, you know, you can just throw your controller through the TV. Anyway, so yeah, that's all I've got to say. So this is me using artisan and I'll see you again next time.","Hey everyone, this is me using artisan and today I'm going to take a look at limbo The Xbox live game not the actual sport anyway Now I took some advice for a friend of mine in regards to this My friend Rob suggested I give this game a go now seen on Xbox live But it was always a case of I don't know if I'm in the mood for that. It looks very grim But I gave the go now 1200 points which actually I didn't mind playing paying, giving the actual game was really really good. Now, just a little interesting thought, this game was designed by a very small company called Playdead, which is based in Copenhagen. At the time, the website was updated, they only had 20 people working in the office now, and this was their first game. I'm just really stunned at the quality, it's so good and I really can't wait to see what else they're gonna bring out. Now, for the rest of this review, I'm gonna have to turn the lights off, I think. There we go. So the story is you are this old dude, little guy, who goes off into limbo to find your sister.

Then you have your spectator select a card and they all remember that card and place it back in the deck. Like so. Cards are now shuffled. You can even shuffle them again if the card doesn't.

On Sunday September 11, 2011 we plan to let them know about it! Will you also? There was NEVER a formal disclosure to Jehovah's Witnesses at meetings or in WT literature or letters telling the JW's about the affair. Word is though, that several elder bodies, especially in the UK did receive a letter from WT headquarters admitting their involvement with the UN and giving a deceitful excuse for becoming affiliated with the UN. Despite this, many elders still DO NOT know about this in the United States!  So since the GB won't tell them, WE WILL! The plan is simple. (A.) We will put flyers on the windshields of JW's while they are attending the meeting on 9/11/11. You can make your own flyer or use the one we produce for all to download and print. It will be a copy of the Guardian newspaper article that first exposed this in the UK in 2001 and a quote from the October 1st 1995 Watchtower in which the WT praised the U.N. (B.) An extensive online campaign on 9/11/11 which includes making your own video exposing the WT/ UN affair, posting links on current JW's profile pages that expose the UN affair, and anything else that could get a lot of internet attention to this affair online that day.  Any other ideas you have are welcome! Using banners, commenting at the WT meeting and telling about the affair (if you still have that luxury), shaking hands and telling them face to face, wearing t-shirts that tell about the affair to the meetings and conventions, etc., knocking on JW's doors, sending JW's letters, protests, getting in touch with news sources, etc., etc. These are all things we can do also or in addition to using flyers. Link to Guardian Newspaper Article exposing the WT / UN affair: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/oct/08/religion.world Also a site with lots of helpful info on this subject: http://e-watchman.com/jehovah/chapter-11-strange-bedfellows.html","x264, 002, 006",2464,32,34,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/4lmdgyyK-DE.mp3,"Jehovah's Witnesses need to know that the watchtower became recognized as an NGO under the Department of Information of the United Nations. They got to know this. This is the biggest act of hypocrisy. It's an act of infidelity and witnesses don't know. So on September 11th, this year, 2011, which falls on a Sunday, many ex-Jehovah's Witnesses are going to go back and look Let the Jehovah's Witnesses know. Now it doesn't have to only be ex-Jehovah's Witnesses if you are a Jehovah's Witness and know this and feel it's an act of hypocrisy. Then on that day, tell Jehovah's Witnesses about it. Tell your parents or your family or your friends, somebody. Even if it's just one person, tell them sincerely. And anyone who's associated with Jehovah's Witnesses, maybe your Bible student, maybe you're still studying, You never really got baptized. Nothing prevents you, if you're bold enough to do this, go into the Kingdom Hall, maybe even sitting through part of the Watchtower meeting, and just telling witnesses face to face about it. You could pick a hall where nobody knows you, or you could pick a hall where they do know you, however you want to do it. Another thing that you could do is, oh, you could wear a t-shirt. You could write on a white t-shirt to Internet news sites, you know, TV, news stations, in any place that we think might think this is a big enough story, because that'll get the word out. That's a great way to get the word out, obviously, through the media. Now, if you're wanting to participate in this, then the first thing I think, the first thing that you can do that's helpful is actually make a video to get more people doing it, too. to tell people that it's gonna happen on September 11th and to ask more people to join the cause because we need a lot of people to do this. I made a Facebook event invite about it and a good bit of people have responded. So that's good news. I think right now there's 30 something who said they're gonna do it, 20 something that says they might do it, and there's been over a thousand and invited so the numbers should keep growing and You know that doesn't mean that there's not more people who are willing to do this We don't need like a thousand people would be great if we had a thousand people But even a hundred people doing this all over the United States is great and everybody who signed up to do it so far Or said they're gonna do it They're all over the United States people in California people in Michigan I'm in Georgia. I can't remember my memories failing me right now under pressure of the camera. And sign up for it or whatever you want to call it. But get the word out about this. Use social websites, make videos, ask people to do it. Oh, and another important thing, on September 11th, and I forgot to mention this, this is so important. We're not just going to go to the Kingdom Hall and call up friends and relatives that are JWs and all that stuff. We're also going to use the internet that day. a couple of days in advance, you know make a video and upload it that day telling about the watchtower joining the UN or put a link to a website telling about the watchtower UN affair own a Jehovah's Witnesses page I go directly to their Facebook pages and And put up, but you know links and all sorts of things that day In addition to going to the Kingdom Hall and doing the other things that we're doing So that we can get as much attention to this fact as possible because Jehovah's Witnesses need to know this. This is a big deal. It's a real big deal. And I know that this has been, you know, we've known about this for a long time. It's been on the internet for a long time. But Jehovah's Witnesses don't know about it for the most part. Even elders don't know about it. So we need to get them to look at these things. Yeah, the Guardian newspaper article telling about this came out in 2001. Most witnesses though haven't read it and they're not searching for it. So if we can provide that for them it can help them to see that even the men that they respect so much in this organization have made a great mistake and this can help them to free themselves from the control that men have over them right now. and kind of help them to see the broader picture and where we're at right now. But anyway, we do need as much help as we can get. We have to cover the whole United States and Canada. There's probably, there's somewhere around a million witnesses. But since, you know, about 60% of people who become witnesses leave, there should be plenty to help in this work of letting them know. So I hope that you help out. And please maybe make a video also trying to get more people to cooperate.

So the day has come and I kind of figured this day would happen eventually although it did catch me completely off guard. Lady Vixen, the YouTube account that most of you that are watching this or all of you that are subscribed to or have been subscribed to has been completely deleted by YouTube. For reasons in which they're not really telling me. There's a few violations that I guess I had that I don't see as violations because I've seen videos twice or three times as bad if you want to talk about any kind of pushing the envelope kind of deal. But that's beside the point that decided to delete my account. And you can't fight corporate. So I'm done with YouTube. Many people have been going this route because I believe really truly in my heart that YouTube is a bigoted site for the GLBT community, especially trans people. I think that this was a personal attack and I don't agree with their code of conduct anymore because it isn't just me that it's happened to. It's been happening to other people. It's happened in the past to other people and it will happen in the future to other people. Not telling you to delete your YouTube account. I'm saying I'm not going to be really a part of it. I made this channel as a way to let you guys know what's up. I believe even press Hilton to fuck YouTube because of their big activities. It's real. It's not good. And I'm done. That said, now it's time to figure out what I'm going to do next. I'm gonna keep making videos. I love all of you guys. You know it. I'm not gonna try to cry here because It's not about losing my account. It's about letting you guys down. Because you guys mean the fucking world to me. That's why I do this every week. That's why we put out three videos every week. It's not because I want anything. It's because we've grown something here. And that's gone now. And it's tough because I don't want people that feel, you know, people that I was talking to you know, through the messaging system on YouTube, I think that I'm not, you know, I've abandoned them or something. You know, what is the fallout gonna be because of this? I'm not, you know, I didn't have 10, 12, 20, you know, I didn't have a lot of subscribers, but the one, I did, the people that I did, and I do, I have somewhat of a deep connection with. And that's what I'm concerned about. Aside from that, you know, it's whatever, it's life. These things happen. It's not, that's not the point. part of it. It's not my ego that's being challenged here. It's that I feel like I'm losing all you guys. So I will, until I get other things started, and I do it just contradict in myself, I will be posting updates on here about what's going to be happening. I'm going to put my full energy into something.

I'm done Aside from that I was supposed to go out to a Halloween party that I don't think I'm gonna go I don't know I may have a cigarette and see if I'm gonna be the gangster I was supposed to be tonight.

For Cristina, 40 men with mangas, machetes and even with her hands have managed to limit the advance of fire, but neither they nor the helicopter of the Air Force have enough results to finish the fire. Very early on, emergency organisms reactivated their work to try to control the forest fire that, from yesterday and throughout the night, has been active consuming part of the serruses of the north of Bogotá. while the helicopter tried to turn off the flames. Down there, full of 40 firemen, they worked without stopping to control the conflict. The fire was almost under control.

Le gouvernement a toujours minimisé ça. Des signateurs de la majorité des signateurs socialistes ont voulu s'opposer au projet Dois. Leurs votes n'ont pas été comptés. Il y a une vraie violence qui est faite. Mais derrière ça, la première violence, c'est une violence contre les enfants. Ces enfants à qui on va donner de papa ou de maman et à qui leur camarade de classe va dire mais il est où ton papa, il est où ton maman ?

The government has always minimized that. The signators of the majority of the socialist signators wanted to oppose the DOA project, their votes were not counted. There is a real violence that is done, but behind that, the first of the violence is a violence against children. These children to whom we will give two parents or two mothers, to whom their classmates will say, but where is your father, where is your mother? They won't have anything else to say that I don't have a father or a mother because 10 years ago the government banned it in France."

Hello you David. Nice to have you back Lisa is here with an awesome item and you know We were going on the show today with my team and when I got to decide on my rundown I just said tis the season. Yes, we are getting into warm weather My hook or my cook we're gonna get there. I'm told by the weekend. It's supposed to warm up 70 degrees next week I'll take it. But you know what? 70 is going to give way to 80 and then 90 and summer time arrives. And if you're looking for the best way to keep things cold without turning your lunch or your beach cooler into a great big water ice bath, we're going to show you how to do that with these thermofrees. I personally use these all summer long. I absolutely love them. They're so easy. Talk to us about how this works. Well, you use just exactly what you said, David. Typically, when we want to keep things cold, we use ice or we use a big bulky gel pack. But this is what happens. The ice melts and then, oh gosh, this This is what happens. Everything becomes a wet, drippy, soggy mess. Not a good idea, right? Okay, thermo-free sheets are the ultimate and ice gel pack substitute. Why? Because this is how you get it at home. It's nice and thin, way for thin. All you have to do is hydrate it in warm water. So basically, put this in a sink or in a bowl of warm water. Exactly. It'll puff up. Yep. And when it puffs up, put it in the freezer. Put it in the freezer. And in two hours, David, frozen solid. But the beauty of it is, isn't that awesome? It's flexible when it's frozen. You are good. I know, right? But so like you can actually conform it around your food and beverages to keep them colder because guess what? This is not going to conform around your food and beverages. Yeah, it's not going to, it's not going to envelop or surround your things in cold. Exactly. Let me show you what you've got to choose from here in terms of colors. And then Lisa, I should also say we're getting a total of how many sheets? You're getting a total of 15 sheets. You're getting five large and 10 medium. 10, five large and 10 medium. 15. You know, we went to the thermofreeze website and you would pay $16.10 for just 10. of them. Oh, see, we're going to charge you $19 and you're getting 15, a total of 15. And here are your color choices. I have polka dot. This is called damask or damask. Potato potato. And then finally we've got it for you in the the plaid. I have it in the plaid and I really love mine in the plaid. Now let's also talk about the fact that this is flexible. This thermo freeze will actually wrap all the way around your water bottles around your sandwiches around your kids juice boxes. I have all kinds of things. But the big thing, the big question is David, is yes, it's going to work, but does it really work? We wanted to prove to you that it would work. So what I did is I set up two lunch boxes here. Okay. This one has the big heavy bulky gel pack that is not going to conform around your food and beverages. This one has the thermo-free sheets that you can wrap around your food and beverages. Okay. So if we look at the thermometer here, we can see that this was set four hours and 27 minutes ago. And if you widen out just a smidge, you can see that the milk in this is 59 degrees because this is where the thermometer is. Now I'm going to take it out of this milk, this lunch box and put it in the thermo freeze box and you're going to see that temperature is going to go down. So here it's now 48 and what was it at 50? Isn't that amazing? So okay, so it went down to 39 degrees. Okay. Now this was like I said, we packed him four hours and 27 minutes ago. That's still going. Oh my goodness. Look, it's already this is because you cannot not put this close to it. I don't know about you, but I'm not drinking milk. No, that's not safe. It's not healthy. All right. How about when you're shopping and you have so many errands to run and you have to run home right after you grocery shop because everything's going to get warm. Not anymore. Bring your thermo free sheets. That's why I like to buy different colors because I use a certain color just for my food when I'm shopping. So now because you can cut it to size, it's flexible and frozen and it's reusable. Do I tell you that? Over and over again. And do we ever have to rehydrate it after we have to have done it in the water once. No, you can't. Absolutely. Well, what will happen is this eventually over time it might start to thin out a little bit, put it back in water and rehydrate it. Not a problem. Over and over and over again. I just leave them rolled up or flat in my freezer, depending on what else I have in the freezer. Absolutely. You know, earlier we talked about the Sachi bags and Deb always tells us to put a little cool gem or something inside. Oh my gosh. This in your Sachi bag because the Sachi bag is already insulated. You got it. Yes. Wrap it in your. This is a Sachi bag. There you go. So here what I have is I have my salad in my Mr. Lid container. I'm gonna put that in there. Then I'm gonna wrap up. Let's see here. Let's put this sandwich in there. And I have mayonnaise on here. Do I want to put that in without something to keep it cold? No. Right? No. That's a sick, that's a sick, you don't want to wish on anybody. Here's my salad dressing. Put it in there. And if I were to put this in David, I better take something out. I'm not gonna be able to fit my apple, which is healthy. I want that. Might not fit my water because it's too big and too bulky. Now I'm ready to go. And never mind the fact that those those are expensive when y is a great way for you to be a if you've got a little one you to the park or to the pool, their baby bottle or maybe medicines have to stay cold. That's gonna be as well. $19 is your price for this back down on this end, Lisa. What they have and what you will receive five of the medium sized sheets. you can cut them to size. Here is your polka dot. This is damask and this one is your plaid. Thank you. $19. $16.10 is what you'll pay at the Therma Freeze website for only 10 of these. We're going to give you five additional and charge only $19 for the entire set. And how about down here, David? I have to show you, there's such a great value. I know. Thank you for pointing that out, David. But look at all the uses. Picknicking. Maybe you're going to be doing going a very fancy picnic. Oh my goodness, isn't this nice? Camping, take it to the beach. You can use it for anything reusable over and over, David. 800 of these sets are gone, and I know you may be thinking it's a little early to be thinking about hot weather. But you know what? Oh, no, it's coming. Before we know it, it'll be here, and you'll be so happy you have these, and you can reuse them over and over and over again. Miss Lee Sidenover, we're going to see you Sunday. Thank you, yes. I shall see you then. Looking forward to you then. Take good care. Thanks, David. Thank you, love. Thanks, everybody. This is Kate, 34711. Stay on the line, then.","Hey, let's also go right on into dish with David every Wednesday and Sunday I choose an item in the show that I think is a personal must have and tonight my choice for you is thermo freeze Lisa Brandy is here.

It explains the effect of the coefficient of thermal expansion in these bars and its effect when they are in a composite form. Brass has a more coefficient of linear expansion compared to that of steel. So brass will induce a compressive stress due to the restriction form steel and steel will induce a tensile stress due to the expansion of brass.","Watch (Collection Category), Read Description, Animation (Industry), Cartoon, Read, Please, Description, Update, Lyrics Description, Animated, Review, Must Watch, Please Watch, Box, Information, Announcement, Plz, Info, Lyrics, Must",26066,117,16,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/77W-QR59Mts.mp3,"Hi friends, today we will be learning about the thermal stresses in a composite bar with the help of an animation. As you know on the screen we have a steel and a brass bar which in a composite state and when it is getting heated what is the difference or how the rate of expansion is happening on these two bars will be explained here. However, there is some increase or decrease in the temperature of a bar. bar consists of two or more different materials it causes the bar to expand or contract on account of different coefficients of linear expansions the two materials do not expand or contract by the same amount but expand or contract by different amount so as the steel and bar has a different amount of coefficient of linear expansion when they are heated separately Brass will expand more compared to the steel. of the composite bar as a whole will be less than that of the brass but more than that of the steel as shown over here in this figure. So that is the reality. So it is thus obvious that the brass will be subjected to a compressive force. Here you can see the brass is subjected to a compressive force because the steel is not allowing the brass to expand to the limit up to which it is capable of expanding. So the brass will have a compressive force whereas the steel will be subjected to a tensile force because the brass is forcing the steel to expand above the particular limit or the state of coefficient of linear expansion of the steel which extends the steel further so it has a tensile force. So to be making it more clear brass will be in a compressive force and steel will be in a tensile force. in a tensile force which makes both of them in a same amount of expansion but the nature of expansion will be different. So this is actually what is happening in thermal expansion, the way of thermal stresses happening in a composite bar with steel and brass. So I believe you got an idea about it. Thanks for watching.","Hi friends, today we will be learning about the thermal stresses in a composite bar with the help of an animation.

Ladies and gentlemen, the experts of the biomass community. You see it's hard to speak for me. It's a real great honor for me and a great pleasure to get this prestigious award at this 20 European Conference. Of course you have heard from Professor Van Swaie the work which was performed during my scientific life, but you can imagine that I could not do it alone. Of course there are a lot of people I'm very grateful that they could do this work. So I have to share this prize of course with my partners, with my coworkers, with the students from the university which working really enthusiastically. to show our results and discuss with colleagues. So at each time I go back I got really inspiring new ideas for my further work. Last but not least I have to thank also the person who proposed me for this prize. I don't know who was it but I thank this unknown person anyway and of course I have to thank the committee. I'm sure there are a lot of other potential candidates for this prize and so I'm very I'm very thankful also to these persons here. Götting was mentioned here as one of our lighthouse projects. And if you think you can plane such a product, you can plane a lot of these things, but you cannot plane the success. To get the success, there are a lot of factors which has to come together. You have to have the right idea for the right time, the right persons there, and then you have to have a lot of luck. And I know I had a lot of luck. I like biomass very much. That's why I'm working in biomass. I can follow directly the speaker before. I think biomass will be one of the key energy carriers for the future. Biomass is a peaceful energy. Biomass is distributed over the world more equally than all the fossil fuels are. So I hope at least, or I'm sure that no conflict will arise to this biomass. So, biomass is stored solar energy. So, my previous speaker already said we need storage capacity and there we have it from the nature. You can use biomass even in night when the sun is not shining. You can use biomass when the wind is not blowing. So, biomass is really an excellent energy carrier. We need it in the future and I will say it's a bright future for biomass. and there's also a bright future for these conference, I'm sure. This award has a two-fold value for me. First, of course, I'm deeply honored to be in a row of other persons that had got previously this award and these are all outstanding people in this biomass society. Of course, I saw this list, but I could not find a lady in this list. It's only man up to now. Perhaps there is a chance for a lady, sorry, that I'm a man. Secondly, the linear born prize had a special importance for me personally because you heard from Wim that Johannes Lineborn was a pioneer in gasification. He worked on gasification many decades before I started to think about gasification. But you could see I'm working on gasification and I'm also sure gasification will be a key technology technology. If you heard the four keynote lectures this morning, three of them were tackling seriously, gasification as one of the key technology to convert the solid biofuel into a more homogeneous gas and you can do a lot of this with this gas. And so I feel as real successor of Lineborn, he was a pioneer and I feel also a little bit of pioneering work we have done and we will do also in the future. It's funny as I wake this morning, I remember sometimes many years ago my doctor said to me I had some problems. He said, you have a cycle of 10 years where you have highlights and then it goes down and then comes up again. So it's more or less through as this doctor says. So in 1982 I finished my PhD. In 1992 I made my habilitation to become a docent is in our region it's a docent to become a lecturer more or less. In 2002 you would expect to become professor. No, it was already 1997, but in 2002, Gösing started operation and it was also a big success, of course. And I was thinking what will happen in 2012, next 10 years. So I think I know it now. It is this award I got as highlight for my professional career. So this award encourages me for further and for in the work of biologists for another 10 years. I'm not so young as I look like, but 10 years are still available for my active work. And to follow some visions from Johannes Leeneborn, of course, in an adequate and modified way for the time now and for the future. As I already said, I'm sure biomass has a bright future and also I wish discomfort and see a bright future. Thank you once more to giving me this very prestigious award. Thank you very much.","Thank you very much, Wim, for this really kind and nice presentation of my work. Ladies and gentlemen, the experts of the biomass community. You see it's hard to speak for me.

We're doing giveaways, $25 gift cards are going to be given out and the $25 is put on to whatever card you want. And we're all doing this to kind of pass the torch. Last weekend I stumbled upon this guy's channel twitch.tv slash jays vfx. He had an amazing quality stream going on. He was entertaining He was Responsive to the audience and he interacted and it was just it was nice. He's an older guy. Well, not 40 but he's a you know a gamer just like me full-time father and full-time Real-life job and loves to stream on the weekend and I wanted to just you know help him out promote his channel some views and if you guys could help me out just go over there hang out for a little bit check them out if you like what you see hit that follow button and if you stick around long enough you might just win yourself some so I hope to see you guys there and I'm really looking forward to releasing some more competitive footage from before game battles was even out isn't that crazy 10 years ago I recorded this footage and I still have it it just still blows my mind so anyways live stream starts at 9 p.m. Pacific time 12am eastern over at twitch.tv.jaysvfx links down below hope to see you there"

Üyellerine sunduğu yüksek kazan sistemiyle X-network, girişimcilerinin yeni göndesi olmaya dayı. X-dicaretin yeni hizmete olan X-network kazancının %70'ini üyeleri dağıtarak sektüre yeni bir soluk getiriyor. X-network bilinen reklam yöntemlerin aksine yapılan harcamalardan kısarak yüksek karpayını üyelerine dağıtmayı garanti ediyor. Kar ortağı üyeler tarafından yapılacak. Sistem tam olarak nasıl mı çalışıyor? Kısaca hizmetlerinizden bahsedebilir misiniz? Klasik network marketin firmaları genelde maliyete yüksek fiziksel ürünlerle çalışıyorlar. Bu yüzden çok fazla karpayı dağıtamıyorlar. Fakat bizim sunduğumuz üründen çok bir hizmet. Üyelerimize sunacağımız hizmetleri bir yıldır süren bir çalışma ile hazır hale getirdik ve zamanlı yapılacak güncellemeler haricinde bir masrafı yok. Bu yüzden çok fazla giderimiz olmayacak ve bu kadar fazla komisyon dağıtabileceğiz. Biz Xnetwork olarak diğer firmalar rakip değiliz. Onların üyelerini çekmeye çalışmayız. Aksine Xnetwork diğer firmaların işlerini kolaylaştırmak için vardır. Nasıl yani? Diğer firmalar elleri kabat etmek yerine onları destekleyecek misin? Evet, aynen öyle. Üyelerimiz eğer başka firmalarıyla çalışıyorsa kendilerine vereceğimiz hazır site ve yazılımlar ile o firmalardaki kazançlarını da arttırabilecekler. Hatta her network marketing firması için ayrı çalışmalarımız olacak. Açıklamalarınız için teşekkür ederim Bay X. Üyeler sistemde alacaklara eğitimlerle sadece interneti kullanarak gelirlerini arttırabilecekler. İki kişiye ulaşmasını talep etmeyen X-Network üyelerinden sadece iki kişiye tanıtım yapmasını bekliyor.

The X network, which has a high profit system in the Uyghurs, is the new eye of the developers. The X network, which is the new service of the X trade, makes the sector a new problem by putting the profit 70% of the Uyghurs. The X network guarantees to increase the high-income Uyghurs by shortening the costs of the products made against the known advertising methods. How does the system work? Can you talk about your services? We are not a team of other companies as Xnetwork. We are not trying to attract their customers. Otherwise, Xnetwork is only to make other companies easier. How so? Will you support them instead of fighting with other companies? Yes, that's right. If our customers are working with other companies, they will be able to increase the profits in those companies with their ready-made software. We will have separate work for each network marketing company. Thank you for your explanations, Mr. X. The system aims at 35 million users who enter the internet every day in Turkey. The main profile is those who spend time on the internet and want to earn money by dividing the time into very small parts. The Uyals will use the internet to increase their income with the training they will receive in the system. The first is the profits from the web sites that will give the users the information. These sites will be updated automatically. The products and the campaigns to be updated will be added automatically. The users will only have to introduce the sites. The second and perhaps the most important is the profits from the Xnetwap introduction. The users will be very much encouraged to introduce the users with the new market plan. The X network is expected to be introduced to only two people from the UL. In order to make more profit for the UL, the first two people will be able to earn from the fifth and seventh steps. The X network UI panel you see on the screen is the X network UI panel. Every UI can see this panel when it activates the X network UI. When you are in the X network UI, a special invitation request is sent to you. With your invitation request, the X network UI panel is the X network UI panel. You can get 4 more U-Series. In short, you can get 5th grade in each new U-Series. And you can get 1500 TL in this new U-Series. In addition, you can get 3-month U-Series. You can get 3-month extra U-Series. Of course, you can get new U-Series."

To jest kolejny unboxing po moim powrocie. Dzisiaj zajmiemy się odpakowaniem edycji kolekcjonerskiej Starcraft Heard of the Swan, czyli dodatku do edycji podstawowej. Na wstępie powiem tyle, że dla mnie Blizzard jest nr 1 jeżeli chodzi o robienie kolekcjonerek. Może można by dodać twórców Skyrima i Widzmina. Ale mniejsza z tym rzecz. Blizzard u mnie guruje. A już powiem dlaczego. Każde pudełko to dla mnie Duże zaskoczenie i precyzja w wykonaniu Nie pomyli się również tym razem Budełka jest bardzo fajnie zdobynna przez wszelkiego rodzaju odblaskowe wzorki a także różne inne rzeczy Budełko niemal identyczne do tego z pierwszej części Świetnie wygląda na półce Prezentuje się naprawdę bardzo dobrze Z przodu jak widzimy znak hekastów Napisy decyko egzomerckiej oraz zupełnie inne tło i co? co my tu mamy? tutaj poza tym nic, za to z tyłu z tyłu mamy dużo, bo mamy całą taką dodatkową kartkę, którą w każdym momencie możemy sobie odkleić kartka ta opisuje wszystko co jest w środku jeżeli chcecie tutaj dokładnie wszystko czytać radzę po prostu zastopować filmik, bo mnie nie mamy na to czasu dobrze no to przejeźdźmy do sedna sprawy zaprezentuję wam teraz jak otwiera się najnowsze pudełko Starkraft Hearth of the Swan Szef z gwiazd, wstąpienie, należał mu się oraz upiery z pustki. Tak wygląda oto ścieżka dźwiękowa z bardzo fajną grafiką. Drugą rzeczą jest płyta za kulisami. Płyta ta zawiera komentarze reżysera, studio aktorskie, sportową, retrospekcję oraz narzędzie pracy. Następną rzeczą jest DVD z grom. W środku znajdziemy płytę z grą instrukcję szybkiego startu instrukcja bardzo ubogalna, co tu dużo pisać oraz oczywiście jak by nie inaczej wersje próbne czyli wersja próbna Diablo wersja próbna Starcraft edynki żeby zaprosić znajomego i wersja próbna World of Warcraft Dobrze, kolejną rzeczą, bo zbliżamy się już do finału, jest ta oto dosyć biedna podkładka z gry. Powiem wam szczerze, nie jestem zadowolony z tego czy umieści coś tak wstrętnego w edycji kolekcjonerskiej. Jak widzimy tutaj mamy bitwę, ale nie chodzi tutaj o samą grafikę, która jest na tej podkładce, jednak oto jak sposób i z czego jest ona wykonana. Otóż, blitzart tak naprawdę teraz nas trochę poniżył, ponieważ To jest ten artbook, który zawiera najnowsze koncepcyjne grafiki z gry, ale również i takie, które są w 3D. Zobaczcie to wszystko w osobnym filmiku, żeby potem nie było w komentarzach. A dlaczego jeżeli tu jest taki spoiler, po co mi to pokazało się w ogóle? Dlatego już się tego nauczyłem i będę to mieszczył po prostu w osobnym filmiku od pakowania tego artbooka. Artbook oczywiście zdobiony jest tak samo jak opakowanie chodzi mi głównie o te odblaskowe wszystkie rzeczy. No i to by było na tyle jeżeli chodzi o tą edycję kolekcjonerską. Jeżeli byście chcieli ją zakupić to koszt wynośni będzie w Wynosił Wam Was ok. Ja za pocięstę 199 złotych mam rabat na jednej ze stron Nie powiem jaki Także Dlatego tyle mnie to wyniosło Jeżeli chodzi o tego typu unboxingi edycji kolekcjonerskich To jest to ostatni unboxing edycji kolekcjonerskich w tym tygodniu Następny unboxing edycji kolekcjonerskich planuje na... jakiś... no za około 2 tygodnie tymczasem zajmę się wreszcie let's playami, o których tak długo marzyłem. Dlaczego za 2 tygodnie? Ponieważ za 2 tygodnie jest premiera czego? Dead Island Raptide. Czyli kolejnej edycji kolekcjonerskiej. No i to by było na tyle. Dzięki Wam za uwagę, trzymajcie się, cześć.","Hello, welcome back to my unboxing video. Today we will be unboxing the collection of Starcraft Hearth of the Swan, which is an addition to the original edition. I will tell you that Blizzard is number one for me. If it's about collecting, you can add the works of Skyrim and Witcher. But the thing is, Blizzard is proud of me. It's a great surprise and precision. The box is very nice, made of all kinds of shiny patterns. The box is almost identical to the first part. It looks great on the shelf. It looks very good. The front is a sign of Hecast. It's a sign of the Egyptian version. And a completely different background. And what do we have here? Nothing else, but the back. We have a lot of it, because we have a whole additional card that we can glue to each other. This card describes everything inside. If you want to read everything here, I advise you to stop the video, because we don't have time for it. Let's move on to the set. I will now show you how the newest box opens. The box opens in the same way as the box from the first part. It shows the bells. And that's how the whole edition looks like. And the first thing you'll see is the well-known Starrcraft Heart of the Swan. The path contains the most popular songs. The sound is very good. The second thing is a plate with bullets. This plate contains a studio, studio, sports, retrospective, and work tools. The next thing is DVD with a game. I will show you the instructions of the game, the game's page, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game, the instruction of the game Ok, next thing, because we are approaching the final, is this rather poor motherboard from the game. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with this, because it fits something like this in the ad-disc collection. As we can see, here we have a battle, but it's not about the graphics itself, which is on this motherboard, but about how and what it is made of. Well, the Blitzart really has lowered us a bit, because This is the best possible material for CD-Action. This is the artbook. It also contains the latest graphics from the game. But also 3D graphics. I will show it in a separate video. I have a robot for $1.99 for one page. So that's why I'm taking it. About unboxing of the collector's edition, it's the last unboxing of the collector's edition this week. I will be doing Let's Play for about 2 weeks, which I have been dreaming about for so long. Why 2 weeks? Because 2 weeks is the premiere of what? Dead Island Raptide. So another collector's edition. And that would be all. Thank you for your attention. Take care. Bye."

The favourite Bellavino still about falling south and they're looking to wind up now. Down to the 250 they come. Flash Happy tackled them to the center by Platinum Dancer. The heckler's trying hard on the outside switching to the inside. KG Rai 2 by Craig Grills. Got the lead pretty easily after 200 litres. Then eased off the tempo coming down this side. If they kicked again shortly after straggling, Platinum Dancer on the outside tried hard. The heckler ranged out momentarily. Now, late run along the inside Mercury Mistress. As they go down towards the line though, Flash Happy will get there. Second at the line.

I've learned a lot about different things like the Pythagorean theorem. I've learned how to make a proper graph and a good table with x and y relationships. And one of my great graphs that I wish to show is my time versus distance graph. It's labeled nicely. It's neat. It has a good story to go along with Can you read us the story that goes with the graph? here. They stopped for one hour to fish small game, to fish small game and to bait the fish. After 35 miles they hit a hot spot and fish for two hours. After that they put the boat at full speed. At 100 miles they got to their destination and fish for six hours catching all kinds of tuna and margarine. And you guys can look at my graph. This is my dramatic representation of a cell and what I had to do was I had to use the ten organelles in a cell and animals and plant cells which are like the features like the nucleus is the main one and then there's mitochondria and I was partnered with Eric and we wrote a story about all ten organelles being kings in different cities and then a huge monster came and they had to all join forces in order to destroy it and after they destroyed it they all formed into one great machine that we're now called today the cell. Missy Nostro has a technique called curse which is circle the answer, underline the question, record your steps, show you work and explain your answer and that helps me a lot because it's all the basic things I need to put together a good program. Now I'm transitioning over to humanities. This year in humanities I've had a lot of fun. We've read Beowulf so far which was, thankfully it was a modified version because Miss Chin said she read the full version in college and it's all in old English and very hard to understand. This is one project that I did. This is called my outside reading project. We picked a book and we read Hatchet, Eric and I again and we read this book Hatchet and we had four at least we have four weeks to do the project so we had to make a timeline Eric and I plan that we'd have the book done in two weeks and then have the rest of the two weeks to work on the presentation and when Miss Chin assigned this project we had to take on two different roles. I was an analyzer so These are my two analyzations. One of them is that there's, in the book hatchet, there's a secret that Brian's mom doesn't share with his dad. And that makes it a lot harder in the book for Brian to stay happy when he's stuck in the wilderness. And then another analogy that I made is that in the wild, all the animals and challenges that he faced helped him prepare for the real life. and also to stand the wilderness and it was a key for him to survive. So, Eric was an illustrator, he illustrated all these pictures and we put together this project and we got a very good grid, we got an A and I was happy with it. I also wrote this one right at the book. What was your favorite part about it? I like fishing so I liked what he made this year and tried to fish but for some reason the water shows the fish It doesn't show the exact place of the fish because there's a reflection in it. So he had to figure that out on his own and I thought that was pretty fine. And one more thing I don't have, Ms. Chen said she might bring it, was the journal writing. It was what I thought of a hero and basically I wrote about this imagination and it was a creature I was a teacher, actually a human who was brave, courageous, he had all the great traits and yeah he was in the army and I explained how I would never want to be in the army but I'll always look up to those who want to defend our country and I can improve all my journal writing by writing a little bit more in them because she gives us 15 minutes to write and I write around page in that 15 minutes. I think I can elaborate more and probably make better stories. So personal goals I have in just my whole life is I want to attend Notre Dame and I want to graduate from there and I want to come back to San Diego and get a job in forensic science and then some goals for these two classes. I want to make friends and have a group of friends relationships with everyone in these classes including my teachers and I want to achieve grades that I think are good enough in my study. And as a learner I like to learn in an environment with people that I get along with, that I work well with, that get the job done, and I need to get the job done and I like it to be quiet. A classroom that would drive me crazy would be all the kids yelling and screaming and throwing papers all over the place and most of all not paying attention to the teacher.

This which we'll undertake will be a lonely journey through Italy's most fascinating ghost towns, while keeping an eye on the many ones all over the world. We'll cover their history, the causes of their abandon, their legends and curiosities; we'll talk about this phenomenon which, according to the estimations, is destined to a worrying increase; and most importantly we'll discover places, often unknown to man, hidden and forgotten, which are going to enchant and intrigue us for their beauty consumed by time and the mysterious stories they can tell us.

Le chiamano città fantasma, borghi abbandonati o in modo ancora più lugubre città morte. e Ghost Town si trovano pressoché in tutto il mondo. Spesso sono importanti siti archeologici di cui rimangono solo rovine o rinomate attrazioni turistiche tenute in uno stato di fattiscenza controllata. Nella maggior parte dei casi, tuttavia, sono vere e proprie città abbandonate e dimenticate dall'uomo. Sentire parlare di Ghost Town richiamo subito alla mente scenari post-apocalittici dopo catastrofi nucleari, ma soprattutto riporta le vecchie città minerarie abbandonate del far west, con il loro fasce nomitico e consumato dal tempo. Quello delle città fantasma è un fenomeno che interessa anche all'Italia, la quale, fra i suoi numerosi esempi, ce ne offre alcuni indubbiamente di grande fascino, ma che al contempo lasciano diversi spunti di riflessione sul futuro preoccupante dei nostri comuni. un paese bello perché è pieno di ricordi La rocca non è qualcosa di immobile. Partiamo, partiamo. Finché il Paese era il nostro abandonato, totalmente. Il 80% dei colpi alla tua chiungue. Ma il vendece l'abbiamo noi, cittadini, che l'abbiamo abandonato. Volevano trasferirsi. Perché chi vuol trasferirsi? Si è rimasto un vostro certo. E ora, oltre a Città in Phantasma, davvero anche Città che sta per sparire. Si perde una parte della storia. Ci sono cose di storia, cose evidente, cose che succedono oggi, sono calamità naturale che portano alla storia questa cosa. Diciamo che io prefererei nostalgicamente metterlo sotto una campana di vetro, poi mancare che qualche giorno lo aprisse qua dentro. Bascerai ogni pietra che c'è in questo questo, di qualsiasi strada, che quando ti pulirebbe le strade non con le macchine mamma, verrai? Se sono tornato a Poggiorriano. che quando succederebbe una cosa di questo paese si nascerebbe per visitatore, non per altri, per portare dei bambini qua e raccontarci la mia storia. Però sempre la storia di Poggio Reale, perché è un paese che vale la pena raccontare la sua storia. Poggio Reale è un paese fantasma che tra le sue mura conserva ancora la storia e i frammenti di una vita passata e distrutta. È un paese che ci aiuta a ricordare che ogni cosa può svanire in un istante. ma che non si può cancellare per sempre la memoria di ciò che ha rappresentato, perché un popolo senza memoria non ha futuro.","There are many causes that can lead to the abandonment of a city that may have known wealth and splendor for a while, and that now it is no longer a place of rock and falling, in which the presence of the man is now a spectral heritage only among the memories of the walls, and whose history can be taken from the legend or be forgotten among the inexorable advance of the shards that slowly cancel the existence. They are called ghost cities, abandoned villages or even more so, death cities. and Ghost Town is found almost everywhere. They are often important archaeological sites where only ruins remain or renowned tourist attractions held in a state of controlled fatigue. In most cases, however, they are real abandoned cities and forgotten by man. Hearing Ghost Town talk, it immediately calls for the post-apocalyptic scenario after nuclear disasters, but above all it brings back old abandoned mining cities from the Far West with their mythical and consumed from time. The ghost city is a phenomenon that interests Italy too, among its numerous examples, there are undoubtedly some great fascination, but who at the same time leave various points of reflection on the future worrying of our communities. A beautiful town because it's full of memories. Rock is not something immobile. As long as the country is abandoned, totally. 80% of the people are closed. But the sale, we have it in the cities that we abandoned. They wanted to transfer themselves. Because who wants to transfer themselves? They left a vote. And now, besides the ghost city, I also see the city that is about to disappear. If you lose a part of the story, There are things, things that happen today, they are natural calamities that put history in this case. Let's say that I would prefer to put it under a glass bell, then maybe someone will take it and put it in the trunk. I would throw every stone that is in this one, on any street, that when you would clean the street, not with cars or cars, you would say, if I went back to Poggiorrhiana, that when something like this happens, this country would be reborn as a visitor, not for others. To bring children here and tell them my story. But it's always the story of Poggioreale, because it's a country that is worth telling its story. Poggioreale is a ghost country that, among its walls, still preserves the story and the fragments of a past and destroyed life. It's a country that helps us remember that everything can disappear in an instant. but that can not be canceled forever the memory of what it represented because a people without memory has no future"

A reorganização curricular que aumenta o número de alunos por turma para 30 e diminui o número de horas de aulas veio simplesmente colocar professores sem trabalho e outros sobrecarregados. Em 35 anos de serviço vou ficar com mais duas turmas qual que teria direito a ter, ou seja, estou a roubar horários aos meus colegas, exclusivamente. O facto de termos 30 alunos por turma põe a qualidade do ensino completamente no chão. Eu sou professora de línguas, como é que eu ensino uma turma a 30 alunos em inglês? Claro que para nós também é importante ajudar os alunos, dar apoio, mas passar assim um ano só a fazer isso não, não é? E mais os nossos colegas que vão ficar vão ficar muito supercarregados, porque são turmas muito grandes, não é? Com muitos alunos, muitos testes para corrigir, muitos problemas para resolver. Um problema dos professores, mas apenas enquanto a sociedade não percebeu que o problema é transversal. São incompreensíveis as medidas agora turnadas, sobretudo numa altura em que as famílias estão desapejadas em todos os sentidos e portanto a escola muitas vezes e nós vemos isso dentro das salas de aula são abrigos. Eu penso que isto é uma luta não só de professores mas uma luta de pais, uma luta de educação. Na cidade de Vila Real foram várias dezenas de professores que se juntaram contra a reorganização curricular com o carimbo do governo de Passos Coelho.","The Ministry of Education has made sure that no teacher without a letter or a letter would stay without work at schools, but few believe it. I don't believe that the Minister said that when he saw the black in the white and the same things as the red and the yellow ones. I think it was to demobilize us, but not demobilize us. We believe that the Minister is in a good position. I believe he did bad things in the Excel sheet, which normally happens. And that he didn't think the number would be so big. Of course it costs me everything. but above all it is a profession that I have embraced with passion. Seeing me in the beginning, I will not go back to a classroom. The curriculum reorganization that increased the number of students per class to 30 and decreased the number of classes, simply came to put teachers without work and others over-carried. In 35 years of service I will be with two more classes than I should have, that is, I am stealing hours from my colleagues, excuse me. The fact of having 30 students per class puts the quality of the teaching completely on the floor. I'm a language teacher. How do I teach a English class of 30 students? Of course, it's also important for us to help the students, to give support, but spend a year alone doing that, no. And our colleagues who will stay will be very, very overloaded. Because they are very large classes, not with many students, many tests to correct, many problems to solve. A problem of the teachers, but only while society does not understand that the problem is transversal. They are incomprehensible the measures now taken, especially at a time when families are supported in all directions and, therefore, the school, many times, and we see this in the classroom, are open. I think this is a fight not only of teachers, but also of parents, a fight for education. In the city of Vila Real, there were several dozens of teachers who joined the reorganization with the government of Passo Escoelho."

Ok. Y le digo ok. Como veis, si hubiese habido alguna regla que machacara al anterior, aquí pondría un ansimo de dado de interrupción. Vamos a ver para lo que veáis. Voy a borrarlo. La regla de afinidad que me acabo de crear y voy a meter en una regla de afinidad. Vamos a añadir la misma regla, pero a una regla de afinidad. Vamos a llamarle T es. vamos a meter las mismas máquinas que teníamos en una regla de antifinidad, veréis que nos va a dar un error, fíjate nos da un símbolo de rojo de exclamación y nos dice si damos en detalles, nos dice cuál es el problema, tenemos básicamente las mismas máquinas metidas en diferentes reglas, con lo cual de abajo de las reglas hay de alguna forma inteligencia, como lo deberíamos para que no te machaques y crees reglas de antifinidad y antifinidad, erróneas bien. vamos a borrar esta regla y vamos a crear una regla de afinidad, vamos a ponerle afinidad y vamos a decir quiero mantener estas máquinas virtuales juntas, es decir, mecheni se cuele porque es, decimos ok, y ya tenemos nuestra regla de afinidad, como veis, estas máquinas siempre van a estar juntas con independencia de cómo tengamos los settings del cláster de resen, sabéis que de resen nos va a emigrar la máquina virtuales de un lado para otro, una forma más o menos inteligente. Pues bien, esto nos va a permitir, como digo, repito de tener siempre estas dos máquinas virtuales con independencia de cómo estén configurados los sitios de RDS. Por supuesto, yo esa regla de afinidad la puedo romper manualmente. Es decir, yo puedo, voy a decir aquí OK, para crear esta máquina virtual y yo puedo decir que esta máquina virtual es el Chains y el 2000 SQL, yo puedo decir que migrarla de un servidor a otro. Eso rompería, por supuesto, las reglas de Afinidad, pero el Cluster RS automáticamente me la movería de nuevo al mismo SX para asegurarse de que estas dos máquinas siempre están juntas. El Chains 2010 y el SQL 2008 siempre van a estar juntas en un mismo sevedor SX o SX-I porque así lo he dicho en la regla de afinidad. Pues bien amigos esto ha sido todo por hoy espero que hayas visto en profundidad el tema de reglas de afinidad y de afinidad. Por supuesto esto se puede complicar Mucho más no es una norma recordar esto de las reglas de afinidad de afinidad no es una norma es más bien una excesión porque en definitiva estamos aumentando la latencia de nuestros sintomas o como digo yo la burocracia con lo cual no abuséis mucho de las reglas de afinidad de afinidad está bien crear un par de ellas para como hemos enseñado para el tema de los controlados dominio para las aplicaciones multi tier paquem frontend y middle tier que queremos tener en un mosex pero a partir de ahí nos volvamos locos recordar no os volváis locos con esto de las reglas de afinidad y de la indefinidad porque en definitiva vais a añadir burocracia a vuestro sistema y como sabéis la burocracia mata por lo menos en algunos países.

Szanowni Państw...,"http://sejmometr.pl/sejm_wystapienia/6189  Posiedzenie Sejmu nr 9 1 marca 2012 r. 15:13:35 Poseł Sławomir Kłosowski:   Panie Marszałku!  Panie Prezesie!  Pani Minister!  Szanowni Państwo!  Myślę, że dzisiaj na tej sali nikt nikomu nie powinien udowadniać, jak wielkie znaczenie ma powszechny dostęp do wychowania przedszkolnego.   To jest prawda znana nam wszystkim od wielu, wielu lat.  Im wcześniej ten powszechny dostęp zostanie zapewniony, tym mniej pieniędzy później wydamy.  A na co?  Na wyrównywanie szans edukacyjnych, bo pogłębianie różnic w dostępie do edukacji bierze się właśnie z tego, że nie obejmujemy wychowaniem przedszkolnym całej populacji dzieci w wieku 3--5 lat, lub 2--5 lat, co jest już dyskusyjne.  Dopóki tego się nie zrobi, dopóty będziemy bić pianę polityczną, jak wyrównywać szanse edukacyjne w szkole, w gimnazjum, a bywa, że i w liceum, i co za tym idzie, wydawać na to pieniądze z budżetu państwa.   Bo na wyrównywanie szans edukacyjnych wydajemy duże pieniądze.  W związku z tym rodzi się pytanie: Czy nie lepiej wydać te pieniądze na zorganizowanie, dotowanie, moim zdaniem bardziej subwencjonowanie wychowania przedszkolnego, uczynić z tego zadanie powszechne i spełnić wymóg Komisji Europejskiej?  Do 2020 r.  nasz kraj ma objąć wychowaniem przedszkolnym 98% populacji dzieci w wieku przedszkolnym.  Nawet gdyby rząd objął dzieci subwencjonowaniem bez narodowego programu odbudowy bazy przedszkolnej  (Dzwonek)  , w ramach tych wędrujących przedszkoli, alternatywnych form wychowania przedszkolnego tego się zrobić nie da.  W związku z tym pytanie do pani minister: Czy rząd zamierza się poważnie zaangażować w odbudowę bazy przedszkolnej?  Drugie pytanie, właściwie do nas wszystkich, stawiam je sobie po usłyszeniu wszystkich wypowiedzi klubowych na tej sali.  Platforma deklaruje: tak, będziemy pracować.  PSL deklaruje: tak, będziemy pracować.   My deklarujemy w sposób zdecydowany, podobnie jak SLD, że będziemy pracować.  Ruch Palikota deklaruje, że będzie pracować nad tym projektem.  Pytanie zasadnicze: Kto będzie pracował autentycznie, a kto tylko teoretycznie?  Przecież wczoraj, szanowni państwo, członkowie komisji edukacji, obecni tutaj wraz z prezydium, rozmawialiśmy o tym, że za chwilę będziemy mieli przedłożenie rządowe, a jest przedłożenie PSL.  I mówiliśmy, że będziemy pracowali nad tymi projektami, a ten dalej będzie czekał w kolejce.   Nad czym chcecie pracować?  Kiedy wreszcie powiecie prawdę?  Przecież rząd powiedział, że jest przeciwko temu projektowi.  Pani minister napisała, że będzie przeciwko, a wiadomo, że zachowujecie się zawsze tak jak rząd.

Powiedzcie raz prawdę.","Mr. President, Mr. Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am sorry that no one should be able to prove that the importance of the access to education is a great value. This is the truth known to us all for many, many years. The earlier the commonality is ensured, the less money we will later pay for the equalization of educational opportunities, because the deeper the difference between access and education, Education is about not taking the whole population of children in the age of 3, 5, 2, 5 years of discussion, 3, 5 years of education. And until we do that, we will be here, a political piano, to see how to balance educational opportunities in schools, in the gym, and in the high school. And what is going on, to spend money on it. From the state budget, because we are going to spend money on balancing educational opportunities, So, the question is whether it is better to give them money to organize subvention, to do so, in my opinion, to subvention of pre-school education and to do the general task and to fulfill the requirements of the European Commission until 2020, our country has taken 98 populations of children in pre-school age, pre-school, non-national program, even if the government took children with subvention, non-national program, The question is whether the government is going to engage in the construction of the school base. The second question is about the club statements. We will declare a decision-making movement and the government will declare that it will work on this project. The question is fundamental. Who will work authentically and who will work only theoretically? Yesterday, the members of the Education Commission are present here with the Presidium. We know that we have talked about the fact that we will have a government proposal in a moment and it is a PSL proposal. and the next one will be in line. What do you want to work on? When will you finally tell the truth? When will you tell the truth? The government has already said that it is against this project. The minister has said that it will be against it. And it is known that you behave always like the government. Why do people who make up a project collect signatures? Tell the truth."

James M.

I'm a Republican from Oklahoma. I'm the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Today, the Obama administration announced an unprecedented rule, one that will have far-reaching implications for each and every American. The administration's so-called endangerment finding will lead to a wave of new regulations, new bureaucracy that will wreak havoc on the American economy that will destroy millions of jobs and consumers to pay more for electricity and gasoline. This bureaucratic nightmare is based on flawed science. Lisa Jackson, who is Obama's EPA administrator, admitted to me publicly that the EPA based its action today on the findings of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, known as the IPCC. She told me that EPA accepted those findings without any serious independent analysis. to see whether they were true. Of course, we now have thousands of emails showing several of the UN's top scientists apparently evading laws requiring transparency, defaming scientists with conflicting viewpoints, and manipulating data to fit preconceived opinions. I use it, say it a different way. They cook the science. For example, some of the scientists involved working to exclude inconvenient facts, most notably the fact that there has been no global warming since 1998, the scandal which has come to be known as Climate Gate has rocked the scientific community. The Atlantic Monthly said, quote, the stink of the intellectual corruption is overpowering, unquote. And the UK Telegraph, that's a major publication in the UK, they said, quote, this is the worst scientific scandal of our generation. The UN is investigating it. Don't expect too much from the UN because they're investigating themselves. But nonetheless, they are investigating it. Leading academic and scientific institutions are investigating it, and I'm investigating it. Yet, Democratic leaders in Congress and the Obama administration have dismissed it. Yet, I agree with Joe Lieberman who said of Climategate, he said, quote, we ought to be demanding that it be cleaned up. We ought to be angry about it. The endangerment finding also will have virtually no impact on global warming. That's because Indian China to the world's leading emitters of CO2 are left out. So our jobs and our emissions will move to countries that have few, if any, environmental requirements. Don't take my word for it. Just as EPA Administrator Jackson said, the United States action alone will not impact world CO2 levels. So today the American people are getting a raw deal, all cost with no benefit. Yet the Obama administration is moving forward Anyway, don't forget today's action was taken just as the UN's Copenhagen global warming conference gets started. President Obama will attend. He desperately wants to show the world he's doing something about global warming. Yet putting on this show has real costs and the American people will pay for it many times over with higher energy bills and many with their jobs. Let's remember that the Obama is trying to do with regulations what he couldn't do through legislation. This is a raw deal for America.","Hi, I'm Senator Jim Inhofe. I'm a Republican from Oklahoma.

Precisaremos de dois recipientes, um com água e temperatura ambiente, um com água com temperatura a 100 graus celsius, e a garrafa pede. Agora vou colocar água quente nessa garrafa, tampá-la, esperar 20 segundos, esvaziá-la, tampá-la novamente, e colocar no recipiente com água de temperatura ambiente. Termoquímica é o ramo da química que estuda a energia nas reações químicas e nas transformações físicas. No segundo esferimento, podemos perceber que quando colocamos a garrafa quente na água fria, a temperatura cai e a pressão permanece praticamente consciente.

Also die beiden haben die gegründet, ich bin dann ein halbes Jahr später dazugestoßen und das war das erste Bilder Street Art Archiv. Also eine Seite, wo Leute sich anmelden konnten, registrieren konnten, sich im Profil erstellen konnten und ihre Bilder hochladen konnten. zu der Zeit wo es Flickern noch nicht so gab oder irgendwelche anderen großen Seiten. Und ich glaube, Le Clemence City hat damals zu der Zeit im Gegend ganz großen Teil so zu der Vernetzung der Leute beigetragen. Das Fotografien hat zwei Seiten. Einmal irgendwie das Draußen unterwegs sein und das Foto machen und dann die Ergebnisse nochmal im Ruhig Tutor mir anzuschauen. Und mich da gegeben, falls dann auch irgendwie von den Fotos überraschen zu lassen. Die Reaktionen auch nochmal zu erleben oder so. Bei mir spielt es einfach eine große Rolle, dieses Teil mit anderen Menschen, das Online-Stellen und andere Leute durch die Fotos an der Aktion teilhaben zu lassen. Größtenteils versuche ich auch den Prozess festzuhalten, weil ich finde, wie Dinge entstanden sind, teilweise viel interessanter als das fertige Ich mache Fotos, um damit Geld zu verdienen. Ich versuche auch davon zu leben. dass es als selbstständiger und als Autodilag relativ schwierig ist, da irgendwo Fuß zu fassen. Das ist ein ganz schöner Hasse, würde ich sagen. Es ist ein bisschen die Frage, wie man damit umgeht. Ich meine, im Endeffekt ist alles fair, komizialisierbar. Und während kann man sich dagegen nicht ums Seil gucken, wie man damit umgeht. Wenn man das als Street-Artist positiv für sich nutzen kann, indem man selber dann irgendwie an die Aufträge rangeht oder irgendwie Wände mal für die und die Firma und da vielleicht noch so ein bisschen irgendwie dann von dem profitieren kann, was man gerne macht. Also ich finde, das spricht überhaupt nichts, überhaupt nichts gegen so. Eigentlich ist es ja auch der Traum von eigentlich mit dem, was man mag, irgendwie Geld zu verdienen, überleben zu können. Klar, alle Anfängen sind schwer oder schwierig und die haben einfach","I have two friends. Back then, that was 2003, the site Reclaim Your City was founded. So the two of them founded it. I joined them half a year later. And that was the first, the first picture street art archive. So a site where people could register, register, set up a profile and upload their pictures. I think that the film has a lot of people involved in the network. I think that's a big part of the process. I try to make photos to earn money and try to live it. I think it's more self-sufficient and it's also difficult to get to the point of being a car that's like a foot. It's a pretty nice thing to say. It's a bit like the question of how you deal with it. I mean, in the end everything is fair, commercializable and you can't really see how you deal with it. If you can use it as a street artist, positively, and then you can take advantage of it, which you like to do. I don't think it's against anything. It's actually the dream of the day, to be able to survive with what you like. Of course, all the beginnings are difficult or difficult, but we just do it."

A Dale is known by many different names. Professor, mentor, visionary, entrepreneur, inhibitor, and I've even heard it rumored on some occasions where students don't quite agree with Dale's assessment of their work. Other epitaphs have been scribed. But that's very, very fair, let me assure you. His efforts have been tireless in creating a unique set of environments for entrepreneurship here at the I both on the campus as well as off the campus. to meet with me tomorrow as examples of Dale's lasting gifts to the AI University. The first is his venture series, the Graduate Level Entrepreneurship Hierarchy. He created expressly for MBA students. Every aspect of venture creation are dissected through a wide array of one-penner courses run on Friday and Saturday on the weekends and are taught by seasoned practitioners and proven entrepreneurs. Dale was the head of our company when he created the venture series in 2001. It put Lehigh on a curve long before the surge of interest in entrepreneurial studies became popular at other campuses. A second example, more recent, Lehigh siliconed out. Keep in mind, The Lehigh Valley is always three hours ahead of Silicon Valley. And it was a fresh start, and we're going to hear more about that shortly.

Those who know me, well, especially my wonderful wife, Kev, 43 years, you know that I am a man of few words. Thank you for that. I will keep my thank you short and to the point because something's going to follow here that kind of sets forth what the experience was with Lehigh Silicon Valley. Let me begin by saying thank you Dexter Baker. Thank you so much for your kind words. I am deeply humbled and incredibly moved by this special award on this special evening here on Lehigh's wonderful mountaintop campus. And to be surrounded by so many distinguished friends of Baker and sharing this part of my life with family makes this moment for me truly a Lehigh moment, a Lehigh moment. Special thanks to my comrades in arms who are the strategic and day-to-day leadership of the Baker Institute. And Lisa, thank you so much for all of your support, your help, your encouragement and your patience. And let's not forget Rick Klein. Rick, where are you? Would you please stand? Rick is part of Joe Kenders' wonderful advancement organization here at Lehigh. Rick is our rainmaker extraordinaire. And you put together for us a path into Lehigh Silicon Valley through the many alums that are out there waiting for our arrival. Thank you so much. You've been a wonderful colleague and friend and there are more things that are going to happen in coming days thanks to your efforts. This past year has been a wonderful roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs in regard to building Lehigh Silicon Valley. many more ups of course to help the bank routine plan organize and carry out a one week immersion program I can recall vividly Todd at my retirement celebration back in May saying today we just need a few days of your time it was one heck of a sucker punch more like a year but a wonderful The one week immersion program that took 56, why 56? Thanks to Lisa, Lisa determined that a bus would only hold 56 students. So there's the 56. 56 wonderful entrepreneurial minded and spirited Lehigh students, including about a dozen MBAs. We marched to the West Coast to create an experience that for most, perhaps all, was an experience that will carry with them for the rest of their lives. It was about Silicon Valley style entrepreneurship. It's a different breed of entrepreneurship. A picture, or in this case, a video, is worth a thousand words. No words for me could do justice to what actually happened. So let's see for yourself. what happens and then I like to return to provide sort of the epilogue to this brief video that we're about to see.","for outstanding leadership in guiding the high university and a program for nearly four decades. A Dale is known by many different names. Professor, mentor, visionary, entrepreneur, inhibitor, and I've even heard it rumored on some occasions where students don't quite agree with Dale's assessment of their work. Other epitaphs have been scribed. But that's very, very fair, let me assure you. His efforts have been tireless in creating a unique set of environments for entrepreneurship here at the I both on the campus as well as off the campus. immediately to launch as examples of Dale's lasting gifts to the AI University. The first is his venture series, the Graduate Level Entrepreneurship Hierarchy. He created expressly for MBA students. Every aspect of venture creation are dissected through a wide array of one-penetra course run on Friday and Saturday on the weekends. and are taught by seasoned practitioners and proven entrepreneurs. Dale was the head of our comic when he created the venture series in 2001. It put Lehigh on a curve long before the surge of interest in entrepreneurial studies became popular at other campuses. A second example, more recent, Lehigh's Silicon Valley. Keep in mind, The Lehigh Valley is always three hours ahead of Silicon Valley. And it was a fresh start, and we're going to hear more about that shortly.

Today we're going to demo the hot can. Now the hot can is a great little thing. It's a full can of wet food inside. It's got a padded jacket which is also used for insulation so that you can hold the can even when it's hot. Now this is a self-heating can and it will heat the food. You open at the top and inside you will have a spike and that spike pierces these holes here and inside You will see there's a can of food with a ring pull. You open up the food, pierce the can and within a couple of moments it will start to get really hot. We'll show you how this is done. So first of all you have the lid which you now place on the bottom of the can. And then that makes the bottom of the can also insulated. So that fits on quite nicely. Secondly you take the spike and pierce the three holes that you saw earlier. all the way to the bottom and that breaks the chamber inside causing the chemical reaction to happen. You've got a few minutes before that happens. Okay, so that's now been pierced. Now you've got the ring pull. Open up the ring pull. It's important to open up the can whilst it's heating or before it heats because otherwise you're going to have a bit of a mess on the ends. So open up the can and allow the reaction to take place. Okay, so now it's time to get the hot. You can hear it sizzling and steaming. It's got steam coming out of the vents now and it's getting very very warm. But the insulation is preventing it from being too hot to touch. At this point you want to get a plastic spoon where possible. Try and use plastic rather than a metal spoon. Because now you want to stir the inside and allow the heat to heat all the way through the food. The reason you use a plastic spoon is because you don't really want to scrape the size of the can. They are coated with a lining and you don't want to scrape that lining off if you can't have them. Now we'll continue to warm for about 10 minutes. Once it's stopped you'll hear the hissing stop but it will still be warm to touch and it will be warm for quite some time. But don't worry, the chemical that causes the heat does not contaminate the food in any way shape or form. It doesn't even touch the food.

Not a bad cross! How did he miss that header? Well he just missed time to jump Chris, that was a problem. Jumped a bit too early in anticipation, once again a lovely delivery. Just jumped too early. Stephen Eyre it was, and it's going to be a goal kick. More headed there, Olympics, walked, kicked out there. Going to be a throw into Hartford. Well even though they scored a third goal there, they're less than settled, they're less than comfortable. The ball is already out, it's a corner kick. And I think Felix Baffel, doing quite a bit after, boards secretary and a stomping of hearts of oak, to extreme right, or curled in. Confusion galore. In defence and in attack. Because this... Sweet lovely ball, comes over. There's no communication, is there, between the two of them? None at all. And just about 20 odd minutes to end. This particular game in Olympics by Dent of the score line clearly in the driving seat. Can't say the same about possession though. Hartford seem to have most of it. But what to do with it seems to be the problem. And a long ball in. Oh! That tackle in the box or outside? It's outside. It's a free kick. Sora's similar challenge being given as a penalty during the playoffs. National Division One. Mediama versus Dwarves, I remember correctly. Meanwhile, someone he sees about to be brought on for Harteberg. We'll just see how things pan out for him as he comes on. The fourth official should stand on the box. We can all see in this substitute. No, he's not. Come on. He's all right. Surely don't mean to suggest that he's vertically challenged. He's definitely very short. Anyway, we take a look at the free kick. And why did I even get my hoops up? I mean, they just, I just can't believe them. I mean, do they understand what a free kick is and how they can profit from it because they've whipped everything over the bar. Just can't understand it. They just keep doing it time after time after time. Meanwhile, a bit of an attack there cut out by Hartavook. Well, it is a good header. And he raises past this man, dragged down. That's a penalty and that's a red card. It's an early shower. I think I wrote an article recently talking about last defenders, they commit the fouls and eventually get yellow cars and start Wellington having none of it, gives a straight red and clearly. Yeah, it's very, very clear, goalscoring opportunity. He's passed the last man, he goes down. I will have to wait and see what Olympics will convert their penalty. And if they do, my money is on them taking the Millennium City Challenge Cup. It's all about who's going to take it. Is it Teigo, Dormund? Oh, Super Penalty! Absolutely. Brilliantly taking Penalty. And look at the dignitaries congratulating themselves. I'll confirm for you who took that Penalty in a bit. Well, that's really Klotty. You might not Klotty. Well, would you believe it? It's Akraha to book one, Olympics four. Look at that. That was cool. The cool operator. very well. Going forward, the referee spotted that he was going to go down so allowed him to continue. Good decision by the referee. And that's Felix Bafo, trying to lay off that ball. Edmund Setche, throws to losing that particular ball. But eventually, he gets help. Hard to go, get possession again, and Felix Bafo decides to go for goal. But at Japan got his ball behind the ball. And clearly someone can't deal with the spectra of a little bit. I think the entire pack is gone. And Ismailayi has been taken off in Aladja Alasa and who scored that score against Hard of Lions comes on. He's worked hard Ismailayi. And this is the chance for Olympics! Anyway, it's caught offside. Well, he couldn't even put it in the back of the net. And that's amazing. Angelo.","That's a good ball to the Krummer.

Si con la familia Touch hemos vendido algo más de tres millones de terminales en un periodo de un año, desde su lanzamiento, tendemos que con este dispositivo deberíamos incrementar al menos un 20% o un 30% aquella cifra.

La relación de HTC con Microsoft es sólida y no es de extrañar que el mismo Steve Valmer se declarará hace poco en Madrid fan número uno de este dispositivo.

If we sell something more than 3 million terminals in a period of a year, from its launch, we think that with this device we should increase at least 20% to 30% that number. its price-oriented market launch should be around 599 euros. In Spain, the growth prospects for this type of device are located above the two digits. There is a media moment around the touch screen, this category of new devices. So what we are perceiving is an exponential increase compared to the previous year. The estimates of some specialized source in market consulting are a 40% growth, 40% compared to the previous year. HTC calls Windows Mobile as an operating system. HTC's relationship with Microsoft is solid and it's not surprising that Steve Valmer himself declared himself as a Madrid fan number one of this device. We are seeing again a trend in the market in which productivity demands are joined. As for a very advanced device, we came from a professional profile where the electronic mail and the productivity elements of Windows Mobile are decisive. with all these people who use these solutions, we are demanding solutions from the field of the OZIO. At the end of the year, HTC Preve will commercialize a mobile model that will use Android, the system open to Google."

I'm DJ Jungle Boy. I'm gonna talk to you guys about the Scratch by Stanton, which is basically a controller. It's completely MIDI assignable. Everything that you would do on the computer, you can do right here. You don't have to go from back and forth. So I'm gonna show you guys how to go over some basic functions using the Scratch in two turn tables. And I've got two Scratches. First thing I'm gonna show you guys is how to do a loop real quick right there. It's a four bar loop. I can break it down. Q points, we all set Q points. I go to trigger. I use one of my accessory buttons. And by doing that, I can set five different Q points. One, two, three, four, five. And I can use them on a fly. Now, the cool thing I can do is I can stroll through all my crates. I can stroll through my records. So I don't have to be like up, down, up, down. I can stroll through right here, through my crates. Find a song and load it on either deck go through my list and just drop drop on all of your Brows your prepare the import you can do all of that using this again. It's completely media signable Some other features is like a sensor reverse I have it so that once I hit this It'll reverse it sensor it on out Another cool thing is that I got instant doubles So if I want to send what's playing on this deck to that deck I got to set the tap So, all I gotta do is it's over there. It's back over there. Relative mode versus internal mode. I can fix that or toggle between even this. That puts me internal and external or relative. I also have a setup so that my master volume is controlled here and fade on out. So again, it's completely MIDI signable. Anything that you want to use, however you want to configure it, you can do that. Not to mention that The stand touch technology and this control surface here allows you to move in many directions. You can go circular, you can go up and down, you can even go diagonal. So it's a pretty cool product.","What's happening y'all? I'm DJ Jungle Boy.

He taught me a lot of different things last week because there's a lot of tricks to the train. He's one of those guys that he wasn't always the biggest guy, but he fights very smart.

It used to happen to see the locker room. divided into three different rooms and it's so hard to get your team together let alone be in 45 minutes late.

Kickoff, we gave little Joey Menser an opportunity twice just to see how he would do when he kicked both of them out of bounds. Felt terrible for him, but our coverage was really good. We got one kickoff return and they mortgred it and we got it back to the 42. and the block you never had to go out. So that was good. Offensively, obviously the key of the day was rushing for 328 yards. We possessed the ball for 37 minutes. Certainly did not throw it as well as we would like to, but hopefully that'll improve as Pat gets more comfortable with things and we get to understand what he I know I've been involved in a lot of games that have been under 100 yards, but I don't think I've ever been involved in a game with one yard. And one yard divided by 50 isn't many inches. So obviously at 33 yards passing and minus 32 yards rushing, we had great pressure, but we certainly have not got any pressure.

The very next week they lost to Cal and should have beaten them. And then since then they've gone on a streak of confidence, I think. They began in 42-21, they beat Silke Rock 27-10 and then came back and beat Mercyhurst 29-25. You know, some very impressive things offensively and I think they're a real steady solid defense. The biggest defensive stat is they've sacked a quarterback 26 times and they've only given up 7 sacks. And our captains for Clarion, Special Team, say Anthony Constantine, who has really come out strong the last couple weeks, in a surprise offensively Harvey Tuck. That doesn't happen very often with your second team tellback. And defensively, Carlos Geter. And the character quality this week is humility. Do you match them up with opponents? with your self-esteem but in how you treat others. And seriously, some good stuff. Quality of being respectful and considering others better than yourself. Teamwork's a constant balancing act between self-interest and group-interest. And this is one your father would have known from Proverbs. Do nothing out of self-ish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourself. They were not. They did not come here respectfully.

When you release the hair, just let it fall into your hand and just grab it and then just pin it back. The curl forms when the hair is actually cooling down so it's important that you're allowed to cool down.

Wir sind wieder in Skyrim und Drix. Und heute wollte ich mal zeigen wie man auch mal so dunkle Bruder schafft gelangt. Aber dazu muss man erst zum Dämonenkind hin. Und wie man hört, der ist schon echt scary. Und da ist er. Der ist er. Ich hätte euch nicht gesehen. Ich... Spiel jetzt mit meinem... Äh... Dann hat Profile, weil ich hab zwei Profile und Spiel da mal abwechseln. Das kann mal sein, dass hier aus dem Spielstand passiert und aus dem Spielstand. Nur, da wollte ich jetzt auch mal zeigen, wie man hier kommt. Mit meinem normalen Profi war ich nicht da. Er ist echt unheimlich gewesen beim ersten Mal. Da gleich fällt er mich an. Endlich! Meine Gebete wurden erhört! Es hat geklappt, dass schwarze Sakrament durchgeführt! Immer und immer wieder! versprochen aber den Gegenstand seiner Familie. Ich zeige gerade wo wir sind und wo wir den Dämonenjungen finden. Das ist hier das ist mal Windholm. Windholm ist eine große feste Windhelm. Windholm. Windholm. Windhelm. Also selbe auf jeden Fall findet man Sturmmittel da. Und ja von da aus müssen wir nach Riften. Riften liegt hier unten. Da unten findet man auch die Giebelskill. Und hier müssen wir hin zum Weisenhaus. und nun sind wir schon unterwegs direkt zum ersten mörchelmord bereit denke ich mal so geschicht damit dem langen schweren zuschlecken Ich weiß, man kann das ganz mit Unsichtbarkeitstower auch, kann man es auf jeden Fall auch machen, dass man gar nicht gesehen wird und niemand das davon mitkriegt. Zumindest ist dann diese eine Person, die man nicht umbringen soll, da nicht in Panik. Was mir gleich sein wird, das ist ultra lustig. Die Leute in Panik zuversetzen, die Kinder alle total entspannt. Aber erstmal müssen wir hier mäucheln. zu einfach jetzt schreien sie alle rum ich war ein bisschen jetzt so habe ich es richtig oder falsch gemacht aber man kann das nicht fehlen muss sie nur umbringen und dann ist auch alles gut für den quest und laufen hier die kinder rum und die frohe schreitgnadehilfe tut mir nichts wenn jemand um und die kinder kein einziger besagt ist total entspannt eine leiche noch kein t-be Aber wohl nicht, doch. Passt schon. Ja, sie ist tot. Ich wollte mir das nicht herumschreien. Und da ist diese andere Haushälterin. Und wie lustig es ist. Sie rennt hier voll schreiendliche Wohnung. Voll in Panik rennt sie hier im Weißen raus. Und die Kinder sind total getilnt. Ich dachte erst, die würde ich mich jetzt hier bei den Wachen anscheißen. Aber nee, die kommt hier nicht mal raus, glaube ich. Ich wusste, dass du mich nicht verheiratest. Ich wusste, dass die dunkle Bruderschaft mich retten würde. Hier, wie versprochen. Das sollte euch ein nettes Sympchen einbringen. Und danke, vielen Dank nochmal. Wenn ihr das nicht merkt, werdet ihr nicht mehr wieder da. Ich bin total in dieser scheiß Sequenz gefangen. Ja... Und ich dachte schon müsste ich wieder sterben. Aber dann habe ich mir den Drachen erstmal vorgeknüpft. Man kennt das ja. Ich tue euch den Kampf jetzt nicht an, weil der dauert halt wieder mal seine 2, 3, 5 Minuten. Aber ich habe ihn mir gepackt. Im Super sucht die Style. Hof gebrutzelt angezündet und abgestochen habe ich ihn. Und es gibt sogar ein Finishing Move für den, was ich vorgegen wusste. Und ist doch für jeden Fall auch mal, dass mir jetzt so sich das anzugucken. Schnauze! Gut geschlafen? Eine alte Hexe, die in ihrem eigenen Weisenhaus ungebracht wird, schafft einen Mordauftrag. Den ihr gestohlen. Trefft eure Wahl und löscht ein Leben aus. Ah, die zänkische Ehefrau, ziemlich lockeres Mundwerk. Ich weiß nicht mal von was es war. Stil! Was hatte ich da dann auch gezeigt durch? Das gibt es. Das gibt es und das gibt es. Und ja, mit diesem kleinen Angezeichen, wie man in die dunkle Ruderschaft kommt, fahrschiede ich mich hier von euch jetzt so live und direkt und auf wieder gesch...","Good morning and hello everyone! We are back in Skyrim and Drix. And today I wanted to show you how to get into the dark world. But first you have to go to the demon child. And as you can hear, he is really scary. And there he is. I didn't see him! I'm playing with my... uh... I have two profiles and I'm playing with Abdex. It can be that you're playing from this game and from this game. I just wanted to show you how to get here. With my normal profile I was like... It was really amazing at the first time. I'm gonna fail right away. The exorcist from the dark room is in the heart of the light. And yes, the quad stone is now quite close because of the fact that he wants to kill this old Dreadlock and we do the Jordot for him. but the other side of the family. I'll show you where we are and where we find the demon young. This is here. This is Windholm. Windholm, the big, solid, windhelm. Windholm, windhelm. So you definitely find a stormman there. And from there we have to go to Riften. Riften is down there. Down there you only find the Giebelskill. And here we have to go to the Weisenhaus. Let's go in. And now we are on the way. Directly to the first Mochilmord. I think. History with the long sword-moss-touch. Ah, look, here, he's improving his grinding. He's improving it, but only at the best. He's going very slowly. He only wins a minimum of a bit and then he's... ...getting this ability pretty fast. He's going very slowly, as I do now. And it's actually going pretty fast, he's improving it. I was a bit too loud, but I did it right or wrong. But you can't fail, you just have to turn around. And then everything is good for the quest. The children are walking around here. And the frog-sweeping-nade-help is not helping me. I'm taking someone around. And the children... No one tells me, it's really exciting. A corpse, no problem. I don't know if it's true or not. But it's not true. It's true. I knew the dark brotherhood would save me. Here, as promised, you should bring in a nice little sim. And thanks, thank you very much again. I will be in the dark of the dragon. I'm stuck in this shitty sequence. And I thought I should die again. But then I knifed the dragon first. I don't do that now, because he takes another 2-5 minutes. But I packed him in the Super Suchty Style. I was bruised, bruised and stung. And there's even a finishing move for the one I wanted. I have to see what's going on. Come on, I'll tear your eyes out. Now I have enough of the ember. I have enough of the ember. Ember! I made a mistake. I'll never get hit again if I get a zettel in my hand. In any case, you have to be on this courier. It will come to you in some place and will make you go through the way. I have a zettel, then you will be in some bed. You just wake up and you can't care about the bed. You can just rest. I'll save this. I said that I would not say it. I showed you the little thing that you can do in the dark red shop. I'm going to live from here and I'll be back."

This is Phi talk bringing you the latest and greatest information from the Phi Kappa top fraternity. Hello, my name is Joshua Havener and I'm JJ Lewis with the night's top story Phi Kappa top is raised over four thousand dollars for local national and international charities So their annual October Fests program which includes pie Phi top the pick a Phi Todd eight auction and a joint haunted house with the sisters of Sigma Sigma Sigma over one thousand man hours of service were logged philanthropy does not stop there either folks as the brothers are working with the sisters of Zeta Alpha on their second annual pressure luck for charity event which is meant to raise funds for the operation home front a national charity supporting the families of American troops overseas. Josh? Thanks JJ. This year kicked off the 100 year anniversary of our fraternity. The brothers of Phi Kapita have had many fun and exciting brotherhood events this year with trips to Grand Rapids to watch the Griffins or to Auburn Hills to cheer on the Pistons. Phi Ta has been all over the state being one coach here group of men. From grilling on the front porch, movie nights, trips and events, FITA is one of the stronger brotherhoods on Central Michigan University campus. Now let's turn things over to our man on the street, John Kaczynski, with a look at FITA's Greek and community relations. John? Yes it is Josh, but you need to remember that this is coming from the Gamma Lambda chapter, the same chapter that has had the best Greek relations on campus this year, with not one, not two, not even three, but five brothers being given the honor of being a sorority sweetheart. Wow, John, that is phenomenal. Who were these five brothers? Well, Josh, there was brother Neeson, who was the Alpha Sigma Alpha sweetheart, brother Wheaton, who was the Delta Phi Epsilon sweetheart, brother Lewis, who was the Sigma Sigma Sigma sweetheart, brother Maroney, who was the Sigma Kappa sweetheart, and brother Jackson, who was the Phi Mu sweetheart. Now, John, is this the same group that has also interacted with many other groups around CMU's campus? Actually, Josh, this group interacts almost every group on campus, in almost every capacity, from the joint haunted house with Sigma Sigma Sigma in the fall, to the easter egg hunt with Sigma Pi in the spring. But this is no surprise when you have a brother of the chapter sitting as the vice president of external relations on IFC and the Greek Week co-chair. Does that brother ever sleep? No, I don't think he does. From what witnesses are telling me though, is that he runs on caffeine and pleasure of knowing he helps out people. that Phi Kappa Ta was one of the most engaged chapters on campus this year for community relations. Can you elaborate on this? people he helped. The chapter itself has helped out during many events in the community to help bring in members of the community through the fall haunted house. That is great news to hear about one chapter's efforts throughout the year. Josh, it just shows that a little bit of motivation and great leadership can create great things. Back to you. Thank you John for that in-depth field coverage. Working with other Greeks is one thing, but this just in, the brothers of Phi Capita have been serving in numerous RSOs on the campus of Central Michigan University. through the leadership of Phi Capita, Towers Moving Day, Homecoming, and Greek Week have been a tremendous success. Even the Student Government Association has left a positive mark with two Phi Tos serving leadership roles from the Senate Leader to Chairperson of the Student Budget Allocation Committee. Those Phi Tos sure are leaving their mark in many student groups, with each brother serving in at least one other RSO on campus, including two on the Executive Board of the IFC. Josh? Right you are, JJ. This year also marks the first year that we are implementing the IFC the Building Men of Character Program. This exciting six-week program takes our new associate brothers through a series of lessons that help them better understand what exactly it means to be a FITAW man. While this program has been furnished all FITAW chapters through our national headquarters, we've tweaked it just a little bit to show the history of Gamma Lambda through its founding as Lambda New to where we sit presently, the best group on campus. Through the course of the year, we will have initiated 11 new brothers with many more to come in the fall semester. I believe now we have breaking news on the risk management Let's go back to John Kaczynski for a look at the latest things happening. John, what's the scoop? on the map by instituting a card swiping system for parties at the Phi Tau house. John, did you say a card swiping system for parties? Yes, JJ, I did. This will allow for a more efficient and effective manner to make sure those visitors entering the house for parties are on the guest list. That is a very innovative idea, John. Thank you for that thrilling report. When it comes to educating their members, Josh, the brothers of Phi Kappa Tau have baked the biggest cookie. Each year, Phi Kappa Tau sends brothers to two regional Phi Tau conferences, one in Columbus, Ohio called the Leaders Conference and one in Washington, DC called the Capital Conference. Brothers learn what it is to be a phytaw and how to help grow and expand their chapters back home. Phytcapita also sends brothers to the MGCA Conference and the Leadership Summit to further enhance not only their knowledge of phytaw, but their knowledge of Greek life in general. These guys have it right. Expand on the brotherhood and the Greek community at the same time. Now it's time to check in with phytaw meteorologist Shaun T. Johnston with the look at the current of the alumni relations situation. Sean, how are things looking? South Main in the formation of a Phi Kappa Ta house incorporation. Switching gears and taking a look at the scholarship outlook and forecast for Phi Kappa Ta, we can see that GPAs were a little bit low for this season. But with some incorporated new scholarship selling techniques and some new programs to help our brothers study better, we can see that the general trend of scholarship is going up for the Phi Kappa Ta fraternity. That's a look at the Phi Kappa Ta meteorology forecast. Back to you at the news desk. keeping close at hand with President Rouse pushed for more diversity on campus, the brothers of Phi Kappa Ta implemented a diversity chair three years ago. The chairs this year have taken the reins this year to prove that Phi Kappa Ta is still the most diverse group on campus. Phi Kappa Ta has always and will continue to strive for the most diverse group of individuals to don our colors and letters. In what other group can a gun-toting hillbilly have so much in common with a gospel singing teacher in the Dominican Republic? Where else can a self-proclaimed technology geek get along so well with the jock. Nowhere else but Phi Capita. JJ? You got that straight, Josh. Phi Capita also made an impact on campus and the community, and the community even aided in this task. Through the pressure, luck for charity event and the annual Phi Talk car show, brothers and members of the community have been raising money to make a difference. Over $1,000 was raised by the brothers of Phi Capita with the support of the residents of Mount Pleasant this past year alone. Well, that's about all the time we have for this edition of Phi Talk.

En primer lugar, voy a enseñar un maquillaje de Ibrachet, creo que lo enseñaba Paulina 1986, un vídeo suyo y la verdad es que tenía razón porque el maquillaje es una gozada, vamos. Tiene una textura que yo no la he visto la verdad nunca en ningún maquillaje, aunque creo que tampoco me he visto. Bueno, que el maquillaje no ha indicado para todas las pieles, es decir, yo creo, por ejemplo, para las pieles grasas pues no vendría muy bien, pero voy a enseñar, bueno, el bote sería este, trae esta su tapa, trae 40 mil litros y mirad a ver si podía apreciar por la cámara la textura del maquillaje, no sé si, pero es una maravilla de verdad. Además, tenéis para elegir, por ejemplo, entre un tono si soy rosado es que es un maquillaje en crema conforme piel luminosa, lisa y uniforme con aceite de cárduo, nudo y nutritivo es de la colección Culez Natura y de lo mismo traje también estos polvos para aplicarlos con este maquillaje son unos polvos compactos en el mismo tono yo tengo el tono 200 trae un espejito eso son los polvos y trae aquí una esponjita y luego también traje traes de sombritas que estaban también relajadas una gris esta blanca y esta rosita son muy luminosa y la verdad es que pimentan bastante bien esta en la blanca la gris a ver es esta un bril metalizado muy bonito y la rosita otra sombra que me gusta mucho son las sombras de mousse de rime es un tono como azul y luego por ejemplo en el mercado una Bueno, pues esta es la rosa y luego del mercado no pues traje también este que está en malte instantáneo. Sé que bueno, si fuera creo que hay otro, me parece que cuesta solo unos 6€ y algo 7€ y este bueno pues por 1,50€. Vamos a probarlo, a ver qué tal va. Luego también, bueno, pues fui con una amiga a unos chinos y la verdad es que tenían una parte de maquillaje bastante grande y bueno, metrán los dos colores que creo que costaba 1 euro tiene como 4 tonos distintos y al mezclarlos queda un rosas clarito muy bonito y luego de la misma marca los trajimos esta parecita viene aquí con un espejito y aquí en medio pues trae una pinza de esponjita Me gustó mucho sobre todo porque estas colores de aquí me recuerda mucho a un cual de Mac me parece que es Tempting como se llama y bueno voy a enseñar algunos colores, este el marrón, un azulito y este moradito mismo, veis? pimenta muy muy bien y luego este malte de Carlos de Roma tiene un color no sé como bueno el que llevo puesto porque bueno me lo traje en parte porque me recuerda al cool reserve de Mac aunque ese tiene un poco más de amalila un tono más violeta pero bueno me lo traje y la verdad es que me gusta bastante y luego tengo también esto todo este sí es un hilo violeta también mate muy bonito y este gris metalizado muy bonito también me gusta mucho","Hi, again! Well, today I wanted to show you something, so I'm going to start. First of all, I'm going to show you a makeup by Ibrahim Rocher. I think Paulina in 1986 taught him a video of his own. And the truth is that he was right, because the makeup is a joke. It has a texture that I have never seen in any makeup, although I think it was a joke. I think that the makeup is not suitable for all skin types, for example for oily skin I would not sell very well but I will show you the bottle this one, this is its cover it has 40 ml and look to see if I can appreciate the texture of the makeup I do not know if it is really wonderful I have a pink or beige shade, it's a creamy makeup with a light, smooth and uniform skin with oil from Cardola Nude Nutritivus It's from the Culez Nature collection and I also brought these powder to apply with this makeup, they are compact powder, I have the shade 200 It has a mirror, dust and a sponge. And also a shade of shade, a gray, white and pink. They are very bright, they really paint very well. This one in the white. The gray one is this one. The pink is very nice. another shadow I like a lot is the Rhymer Mousse I already had one in a very nice blue shade and I brought this one, a very nice copper brown It is very good to apply it as a base for other shadows on top. I use a grey or a plum color, we can apply a grey and a blue shade on top of it. This one is very nice. And then, for example, in the market I buy again this mineral shade, the 01 Rosa. They have brought some of the same ones, like the pink, the green one. I don't know if it's the brown or the gold one, but they brought a blue and a purple one. Well, this is the pink one. And after the market I also brought this one that is so instant. I know that, well, if it were, I think there is another one, it seems to me that it costs only 6 euros and something 7. And this one, well, for 1.50 euros. We are going to try it, to see how it goes. Then also, well, I went with a friend to a Chinese and the truth is that they had a quite large part of makeup and well, I brought both colors, I think it cost 1€, it has 4 different colors and when mixing it, it looks very nice and then, from the same brand, I brought these little sticks, it comes with a mirror and here in the middle I brought a little sponge I liked it a lot because these colors remind me of a mac I'm going to show you some colors this brown, a blue and this purple it's very very good and then this brown from carlo di roma has a color that I wear I brought it in part because it reminds me of the cool reserve of MAC although that one has a little more purple tone but well I brought it and the truth is that I like it a lot and then I also have this two this one is purple it also kills very nice and this metallic gray very nice too I like it a lot"

El instrumento de la ley paga a sus distribuidores independientes hasta 73% de todo que factura en 7 formas diferentes de ingreso. El instrumento de la ley p importante. La primera es la venta directa en la que el distribuidor genera desde un 25% de ganancia hasta un 50% de ganancia de cada vez de cada recomendación. La segunda forma son las ventas al mayor o mayorero en la que el distribuidor genera desde un 8% hasta un 25% de ganancia de esta forma. y la tercera son las regalías. Las regalías es como lo que ganan los cantantes, artistas, como Shakira, como la brigancia Marquez. Lo más interesante es que no hay que bailar ni que escribir como esta gente. En la compañía paga el 5% de regalías por tres generaciones de supervisores activos. ¿OK? ¿Cómo funciona esto? Todos comenzamos firmándoles ese distrutor al 25% de ganarse. Pero podemos pasar rápidamente a la opción de Supervisor al 50% de ganancia. En el medio hay un 35%, hay un 42% y el máximo es el 50%. Un cliente promedio que adquiera su consumo personal para de desayuno puede estar consumiendo alrededor de 100 dólares para un mes interno. Esta persona, si usted está como distrutor, tú adquieres ese grupo de productos en 75, lo pasan a tu cliente el 100, en tu bolsillo quedan 25, matemáticas sencillas, pero si estás como supervisor por hacer exactamente lo mismo, tú adquirirás el grupo de productos de Herbalife en 50, lo pasan a tu cliente el 100 y tu bolsillo quedan $50. ¿Cuántos clientes puedes tener? Todos los que tú puedas entender bien. En promes, si lo haces a tiempo parcial puedes tener entre 8 al 12 del cliente. Aquí en Tegel son 10, al venta o que quieres tener el ingreso extra de si empezar como el intruder. ¿Cuánto amigos como Juan pueden tener? Todos los que quieras, desde cero porque no es obligación invitar a nadie hasta todos los que quieras. Por unos son 250 imagínense que tuviese 1 mil, pero digamos que son 3 o 5, y aunque son 5, los 50 por 5 van 1.250 dólares, solamente en mayorero, más tu venta directa van 1.700, más de 1.700 dólares. Obviamente, tomé a Juan al ver esto, va a decir Mira, como es eso, es el supervisor. Si tú no te lo explicas, él te va a preguntar. Y tú le dices, mira, para estar al 50% tiene que ser supervisor. Y Juan está al 50% igual que tú. Y 50 menos 50, sabes que es cero. Pero sabes que él también va a tener clientes, va a tener distribuidores y va adquiriendo productos para su propio consumo. De todo lo que Juan mueve, pronto lleva o desplaza de esta forma al mercado, la acompañaba a guardarnos 5%. sin quitarle nada a él y te lo van a mandar a ti. 5% En promedir, ¿cuánto es eso? ¿Cuánto eso representa? En promedir unos 100 dólares, más o menos. Si el 5% es más prúster, más, menos, menos, y si no hay nada es nada. Pero al en promedir un supervisor activo, te está pagando 100 dólares en el realismo. No solamente es igual que es como tu hijo en el negocio porque tú lo invitaste directamente, sino que también el amigo que Juan invite que sea supervisor que sería como tu nieto y el amigo del amigo humano que sería como tu vigneto en tres generaciones y estamos en la anusalmente el 5% de todo el bruto que deslace Juan lo que también del que deslace el amigo de Juan y el amigo del amigo de Juan el 5% en tres generaciones y un nieto y vigneto 100 dolares por este 100 dolares por este son 300 dolares pero que puede pasar $100 en cada uno, dinero serio. Y fíjate, estos cheques de regalillas son heredables, son transferibles y se pagan de por vida. ¿Se hacen de la noche a la mañana? No, hay que trabajar y como dije acá arriba, hay que entrenarse si quieres saber cómo hacer eso más rápido. Es el único diferenciador entre el que ganan a menos y el que ganan. Así que de esa forma pagan la compañía y si quieres tener mayor información Te veo en el próximo fin de suya de semana liderado y en la extraganza que vamos a tener en Panamá y en Chile. Así que saludos y así. Desde estamos aquí, desde la República Dominicana, abriendo un club fénsito de nutrición y le doy por la muchacha.","The ULIFE pays its independent distributors up to 73% of everything that is manufactured in 7 different ways. The independent distributor, to pay it in 7 different ways, does 3 basic activities. The independent distributor recommends the product in which it educates 10 people with its nutrition. The first is the direct sale in which the distributor generates from 25% profit to 50% profit of each sale or recommendation. The second form is the sales to the greater or greater. In which the distributor generates from 8% to 25% profit in this form. And the third one is the regalías. The regalías are like what the singers, artists, Shakira, and Marques have won. The most interesting thing is that you don't have to dance or write like these people. The company pays 5% of regalías for three generations of active supervisors. Okay, everything works. We all start by signing the distributor to the 25% of the profit. But we can quickly move to the supervisor's portion at 50% profit. In the middle there is a 35%, there is a 42% and the maximum is 50%. A average client who wants their personal consumption for breakfast can consume around $100 per person per month. This person, if you are like a distributor, you want that group of producers If you want to buy a product from Herbalife in 75% you can buy it from your client in 100% and your stock will be 25% If you are a supervisor and you want to buy a product from Herbalife in 50% you can buy it from your client in 100% and your stock will be $50 How many clients can you have? All of them. You can do it well. If you do it at a time of partial you can have between 8 to 12 clients. Here in Dehnemtl there are 10 clients 25x10 is 250. But to do exactly the same with Supervisor, if you have those 10 clients, 50x10 is 500. I'm not going to ask if it's better because I know it's better to be at 50% as Supervisor. So that's the way. Knowing that, we already saw the first. The second, you see the major. You are here as Supervisor or Majorist. You have this friend called Juan, who likes business, who likes or who wants to have an extra income, they decide to start as an investor. He has a average client, he has 25, he has 10 clients, he has 250, but you know what? Between you and your friend Juan, there is a difference of 25%. And if Juan is earning 250, guess who is sending the other 250, but they send it to you. And it doesn't matter that Juan is in Aruba, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, or in the United States, which is where the company comes from. How many friends can you have? Everything you want, from scratch because there is no obligation to invite anyone to do whatever you want. If you have 250, imagine if you had 1000 or 1 million, but let's say they are 3 or 5 and even if they are 5, 250 x 5 goes 1250 dollars, only the majority, with your direct sale goes 1700 more than 1700 dollars. Obviously, when you see this, you will have a lot of money. Look, how is that the supervisor? If you don't explain it, he will ask you. And you tell him, look, to be at 50%, you have to be a supervisor. And Juan is 50% the same as you, and 50 minus 50 is 0. But you know that he will also have the client, he will have the distributor, and he will buy it soon for his own consumption. Of all that Juan moves soon, moves in this way, to the market, he accompanied us to save 5%, without taking anything from him and they will send it to you. 5% promise, how much is that? How much does that represent? Promise $ 100 more or less. If the 5% is more expensive, less or less, if there is nothing, it is not a promise. A active supervisor is paying you $ 100 in real life. Not only is it the same as your son in the business because you invited him directly, but also from my friend that Juan invited him to be a supervisor, and the friend of the human friend, who will be like your grandson in three generations and we are roughly 5% of all the fruit that Juan class, but also the one that Juan class and the friend of Juan, the 5% in three generations and grandson and grandson, $ 100 for this and $ 100 for this, they are $ 300, but what can happen if and if each one of them does exactly the same, you have 125 supervisors where they pay $100 each, serious money. And these check-ins are already hereditary, transferable and they pay for life. They do it at night, at night, no. You have to work and as I said above, you have to train if you want to know how to do that faster. That's the only differentiator between the winner and the winner. So that's how you pay the company and if you want to have more information I will see you at the end of the week in Liberado and in the extravaganza that we are going to have in Panama and in Chile. So greetings and that's it. We are here from the Dominican Republic, opening a club in Cintos de Andresía and I will see you soon."

The house is rented. Mom Li sold the goods here and raised the brother and mom Li. When the camera was on, Mom Li was willing to share the joy of the son's big alliance. and his mother's feelings were very good. He often kept in touch with his mother. In fact, after Li Zhenchang finished the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he returned to Penghu. As he was against Gu Ba, he scored a point in 6-2, and he got 7K points. He was regarded as a Penghu hero. At that time, he would not only accompany his mother to take care of the goods store, but also bought a pair of sunglasses for him to wear when he was still a grandpa. Li Zhenchang's baseball path is considered one of the most important in the Ma Gong. Here, he also kept his signature ball. The coach and the village head all treat him as a honor. We need to work hard. We need to start to have a good performance. We will do our best. If we have a chance, I will go to the US to see him play. Have you ever received a medal from Lee?

Those of you who have never been to Richmond Park before, this lodge started its life sometime in the mid 18th century as home to the local mole factory.

My duty is to set the superintendent registrar up to ensure that the legal requirements to make the marriage are fulfilled. The first of these is to ask our bride and groom to formally identify themselves. Let's make sure we marry the right couple. and this makes the occasion all the more special for them. Our bride and groom come before you in a public demonstration of their intentions to share the life of husband and wife. For them, getting married today is a proud confirmation of the love, the respect and the friendship they have each other. And it means a great deal to them that you, their family and their friends can be with them on this special occasion. The law requires that they make a declaration that they are free lawfully to marry each other. and then at the heart of the ceremony you'll witness the mention of a marriage contract in an exchanging range. Through these files they're making a commitment to each other for the rest of their lives. However, I do have to ask that any person here present in this very court may head in to this marriage and they should declare it now. I'm quite well included. Marriage, according to the law of this country, is a union of one man and one woman. It voluntarily institutes the line to take the position of all of those Marriage is also a commitment for life. Your options is for growth that no other relationship could be formed. Admitting marriage is not something that just happens, but good marriage must be created. It requires devotion, the ability to listen, the wisdom to know when we are wrong and the strength to be right. It also calls for honesty, patience and humour. It's not only marriage that I partner, it's being a part of it. Marriage is a promise that it will be a part of two peoples and it takes a lifetime. I'm now going to ask you to be in turns to declare that you are free lawfully to marry each other. Sean, free lawfully to marry Alicia please repeat after me. I just solemnly declare, but I know not, but any lawfully impediment, why I, Sean Dunlop and Neil, may not be joined in matrimony to Alicia, April, Bicol. I know not of any lawful impediments of any lawful impediments. Why, I, Alicia, April Bickel may not be joined in matrimony, and not be joined in matrimony.

We are both in the same place, we respect you all the way. And we do a joint bath if you respond to the word. In the presence of your family and friends, you both promise to laugh and care for one another, share the difficult times as well as the happy times, and you promise to stay together as a married couple through your entire lives. I think, Jules and Alicia, come before your family and friends and make a declaration for your intention to share your lives together and help them to mine. You've made the Solomon Binding Contract required by law. You've given them a seed ring and a traditional marking of that orange bell. Now my great pleasure and privilege to prepare your husband and wife. Let me congratulate you. That's been my pleasure."

And it's not fair that every year, looking for a place where we live so we don't pay rent. Unfortunately, we can't afford to pay rent."

Vamos a ver. La primera, me parece una valiente, me pareciste muy valiente con ese segundo trabajo discográfico que admiramos en esta mesa. Profundamente, profundamente. Bueno, cheno, en cualquier caso es feo que lo diga Chiqui, te lo digo yo. Pues Chiqui es, es, es cantante. No, no, feo, soy cantante. Bueno, digo que lo diga yo. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Es además una de las postes quizás con más feeling y que se ha ocupado de unos tipos de música diferentes en esta archipiélada. ¿Qué es tu estilo a tu segundo día? Bueno, eso me sirve a mí para decirte que entiendo lo que es un trabajo, pero admire mucho ese trabajo y tú me hablabas ahora de que este tercero te llevó ocho meses. Ocho meses desde que empiezas a escuchar canciones para hacer una selección, o ocho meses desde que entras en el estudio con las ideas más claras y todo bien arreglado para que empiece a funcionar. No, entonces sin cera yo pienso que ocho meses inclusive es justo, o sea es corto tiempo, pero ocho meses desde que se empieza a pesar todo, o sea lo que es escuchar canciones, me van a llegar no cosas, más o menos voy a y de la verdad es que hicimos un trabajo en un mes y ahora que lo vamos a disfrutar con más tiempo, por favor, voy a repetir con el mismo que confío en mí y soy mujer es un grito a favor de la mujer Te gustaría contar con una mujer productor, musical, instrumentista. también. Nos atrevimos con el Europe's Living a Celebration. Yo prácticamente esta imagen he intentado quemarla, siempre la recuperan y la vuelven a poner. No hay manera. Veanlo. Un poco así como no sé. ¿Qué te imiten? Aunque esto por supuesto ha sido con todo nuestro cariño. Pues mira, el otro día hicieron Cruci Raya y son bueno Cruci Raya que se pone la bota y le mandé un mensaje de odile a los chicos. Muchas gracias que me encantó y que me reí un montón. No que vámonos. Si te empadas por eso ya se te que no tiene ni sentido el humor al contrario creo que eso tiene que halagar es bonito que lo hagan y hace gracia hombre si no se pasa mucho mucho pero en general yo me río mucho. Mira te invitan mucho porque tus fans te adoran venido hoy con corbata venido como tú vistes con tu música y además de saber ahí ahí entramos ahí entramos porque como tiene tantos admiradores y yo soy una también en canarias por supuesto pues hemos recogido todas las preguntas que tienen de esos fans que los han llamado por teléfono y si te parece bien y estás preparada a responder esas preguntas vamos allá por ejemplo Pablo de Fuerteventura pregunta ¿Eres muy coqueta? ¿Cuánto tiempo tardás en arreglarte? Depende del día de cómo me levante. Como todas. Sí. ¿Hombre, hay día que me pega más y más de espor y me pongo el sandal y una gorra y tiro y me voy por ahí y otras que sí tengo que también es mi trabajo y la... Por ejemplo, Andrea desde el diérito te pregunta ¿Tienes algún complejo físico? y hasta creo que ya me ha quedado con el corazón.","I wanted to ask you a few questions. The first one seems to me to be very brave with that second work of discography that we admire on this table. But deeply, deeply... Well, Chema, in any case, it's ugly that she says it, I tell you, because girls are singers. It's not ugly, I'm a singer. Well, I tell you, I tell you, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I tell her, I think that 8 months is even just, it's a short time, but 8 months since you started to listen to everything, I want to give a little more with Carlos, besides repeating the producer we did his work in a month and now we are going to enjoy it with more time, please, I am going to repeat with him, he is a woman, it is a shout in favor of the woman. Yes, I think the advantage we have in this case is that they know me from the beginning, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends I think that's an advantage, but I prefer the good side. Would you like to have a music producer, instrumentalist? Well, within the products, Carlos and Mar de Pablo, which is a girl, and she was already in the first job. I'm always with them. This intense musical moment that is depressing. I also want to propose something fun. Much. In this case, first I'm going to ask you to give me excuses, because this is the intention of having more fun with our audience. I also try to do it, but we do not dare. We dare with the Europe's Living As Celebration. I have tried to burn this image, always recover it and put it back. There is no way. Look at it. A little like this, I do not know. What do you think? Although of course it has been with all our love. Well, look, the other day they made a cross and rays and they are good cross and rays that are thrown in the mouth. And I sent a message to the guys, thank you very much, I loved it. I laughed a lot, no, that's not good. I think that you have to praise it, it's beautiful that they do it and it's funny. Man, if it doesn't happen much, much, but in general I laugh a lot. Look, they invite you a lot because your fans love you, they have come today with Corbata, they have come as you saw with your music and also to see ... There we enter, there we enter because there are so many admirers, obviously, and I am one also in Canarias of course, because we have collected all the questions that they have, I think it's been two years, right? Very good! I don't think it's a good time, and besides, it's something you shouldn't take with so much joy. Very good!"

Limiting the time that the tank has to fight the survivors and limiting his ability to run away and harass the survivors from range. He does get a few hits on NG2, but they're promptly able to take him down.

Start off with the hunters, hit with the smoker and a boomer, but they're not able to make solid contact of more than one survivor at a time. NG2 does a very good job of staying together and fighting off the horde. Here we have an interesting hit. Similar to NG2 with the boomer and the two hunts and the smoke. The boomer gets a second re-boom, but NG2 had a pipe bomb and they're able to keep moving even though they still have a significant ward out there. Here's a really good stop by NG2. Smoker comes in first with the boom. Both are killed. One hunter is me lead off and the second hunter as you see was shot midair. Getting ready for the kishendo event, NG2 goes into the house. itself, computer crashes, and the bot takes over. Bot very unwisely, but very botly.

Just then the main flow of the common infected. They get up that bridge and they get up the bridge and they get up the bridge. They're unable to stop that high palace that comes in just a second on the force run, but they do get them off before he does any serious damage. So that's pretty much it for the end of the round.

What am I? Tell me please, for a moment, what do you feel like being 6 months older than me? Love, well, many congratulations, you know that I love you too much and I hope that this day will pass you by the best. Of course, in company of your whole family and obviously, obviously that you will not get rid of me. This is a small detail of which I wanted to do. I said to myself, I want to make a video or I will make a video with San Juan on my Facebook page. I said, no, I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it the most special for you, as if you lose infinity, listen to it Alberto, infinity of surprises that I have today starting with this video, in fact right now, because the video is coming out to the street and there is going to be the record band, they are going to sing tomorrow, well, in reality they will be the close neighbors that I gave them the coca and they are going to sing us, they have taken out some votes but But you're going to be cool again. Don't be. Well, there's no action. Love. What can I tell you? You changed my life. You changed my future. You're what I want the most. You brought me passions that I didn't know. I swear I'll never let you down. I will never let you go to my life I have to confess that when I met you I honestly said nothing, do not fall in love with this guy because you are not the same as him, you are very different from me but when you are so real, so affectionate, I do not know, it was impossible for me to avoid that a super beautiful feeling was born in me that every day I see you, every day I kiss you, every day I hug you, every day I make you your chin, your skull I don't know, it makes the most wonderful moments that I can share with a person because you are the reason why I started laughing again. I thank you for all the moments we have spent together and especially because you are unique, special thanks to every smile you share with me. Those messages, the messages that arrive in the mornings, in the afternoon, those calls that I don't know, I just... That little love you give me, I don't know, it's unique. As unique as the day you asked me if I wanted to be your girlfriend. Well, your girlfriend, because you didn't say you wanted to be your girlfriend. And the truth is, I don't know, I never think about leaving you, so go making the idea. You go to that house in García or in Santa Catarina or in... I asked you to go to New Orleans, but you didn't tell me. But we have to do something, we go on those Sundays with Chabelo. We have to go to the FL to send a letter to send us in peace. We are going to make all those dreams that we have planned to live. You are the happiest woman in this world. We are crazy. We are just like that. So, one for the other. Well, honestly, the joke of this video was to sing you a song. I practiced it a lot, you know, every night I started singing and I was really scared. I said, I don't know, maybe if I get famous and you know Justin Bieber, I upload a video and tell you, so many crazy things that there are right now. And I said, no, I want to continue my life, my career, I'm not prepared for fame, but it's real, I was going to sing a song, but because of things, but the song is called Felicidad, the Wotwana song, and I hope someday you will listen to it, or if I don't, don't worry, it's more than singing, don't worry. Well, love, I hope you liked this video, I'm going, I have a lot of dreams, very late. This is a small detail compared to everything I have prepared for you for this day. It is the most special day for me, it is also the day that the most wonderful being was born and the one I love with all my heart. Happy birthday, my love, happy birthday number 22, you are making yourself old, you are already preparing the card on fire. Many congratulations, my life, sincerely I wish you the best, I love you very much and I thank you for all those moments you make me spend with you and for a while I see you to sing the little girls and play Xbox and eat a mug Oh, of course I have to give you all your gifts because they are many, you are a chiflado, I'm not going to give you so many things, well, I honestly did not buy anything, I'm going to make another three videos so that you can see them, I don't believe you I hope you liked it, I send you many kisses and I hope this video has many, many reproductions and I wish you all the best and I'm leaving because I have 6 minutes and 45 seconds left. I love you so much, congratulations and see you soon. very very beautiful and I'll see you bye my love I love you bye"

In genere candidati sindaco si riconosce l'onore delle armi. Tu sei consigliere semplice come vivi questa esperienza? Io ci ho creduto e voglio continuarci a credere fino in fondo. Le regole sono queste, il gruppo del PD eravamo due papabili alla candidatura, ha scelto Marco Frizza e per cui io ho votato Marco Frizza perché così è giusto che sia, augura lui buon lavoro e approfitto di cuore. Poi nei prossimi giorni farò una lettera a tutti quelli che mi hanno sostegnato che poi sono molti perché insomma 6.000 orvietani hanno sostenuto la mia candidatura a Sinda come hanno votato al primo turno poi al ballottaggio è successo qualcosa in più probabilmente molti errori anche personali se ritornasse indietro non so se farei tutto quello che ho fatto e aver creduto veramente in un cambiamento come una donna diciamo che conosce un po orviete le istituzioni immaginava sono rimasta fregata da tante cose da tante persone però la vita continua. Sopriamo che hai ripreso il tuo lavoro. Lo vivi con penso, con soddisfazione? Assolutamente sì, ho ripreso subito il lavoro il 24 mattina, il 24 giugno e sono entrata in un ambiente chiaramente dove ero stata trasferita solo sulla carta, perché io ero una spettativa da diversi anni per la mia funzione di vicepresidente della provincia, però è un ambiente bello, favolosi per cui adesso il mio mondo è quello e bene. Bene, auguri per il tuo lavoro e per la tua attività di consigliere a Comunale? Grazie a te.","First common advice comes spontaneously to make a flash interview in the Oriana Stella. How do you experience this experience in the Oriana? It's something a bit typical of what happens here in Orvieto. In general, the candidate Sindaco is recognized as the honor of the weapons. You are a simple advisor, how do you experience this? I am a person who always accepts the rules, the democracy, the electoral results and accepts the rules of the party. I have been in this party for 36 years, that is, the right to be. I have been in the youth of the PC, the PC, the PDS, the PDS and in this democratic party I believe in it and I want to continue to believe in it. The rules are these. The PD group was two pappers in the candidature. Marco Frizza chose it and I voted for him because it's fair that way. He has a good job and he really takes advantage of the benefits of the next few days. I think that there are many, because 6,000 Orvietans supported my candidacy in Sindaco, as they voted on the first round. Then something happened to the ballot, probably many personal mistakes. If I came back, I don't know if I would do everything I did and have really believed in a change like a woman, let's say, who knows a bit Orvieta, the institutions imagined. I have been left out of many things and many people. We know that you have taken over your job. Do you live with satisfaction? Absolutely, I immediately took over the job on the 24th of June. I entered a place where I was transferred only on paper because I was a spectator for several years for my role as vice president of the province. and you are a fabulous student, so now my world is yours. Good, do you want to work for your community? Thank you!"

I ordered it about quarter to five of the afternoon and it was in my hands the next morning, which is pretty exciting. Then my ultra auto lights got a spread and a spotty beam on the back. So this spare wheel carrier will hold up to a 35 inch tyre. nice billet handle nice and smooth also comes with another handle which is lockable which is quite cool as you can see there you can put your tongue in there for your toe bar so that's all a part of your bar so I'll be fitting this to my international scout so my traveler the brackets that it came with I just quickly whipped up use some RHS 125 by 125 by 5mm thick and they will be my mounts to the back of my car and I require the space somewhere to open so that's just mocked up there and just you know saddled together make sure everything moves all the doors clear on the scout and then I'll put on and I'll post another video"

Donc j'espère que ça vous plaît et si c'est le cas je vous invite à garder la suite pour savoir comment je le fais. Nous allons commencer par appliquer un jumbo blanc de chez Nix. Donc encore un terme, comme ceci mais vraiment par petite touche. Et on remonte un petit peu. Et un petit peu également sous le sourcil. Juste ton codois. Je vais venir utiliser un format blanc, celui-ci c'est celui de chez BB Cosmetic et j'en mets encore un terme. Par contre on reste bien dans le coin interne et ensuite son source. Je vais prendre un crayon violet. Je mets le crayon violet intense. Et je le mets en coin externe. Et je remonte un peu dans le croût. Je travaille les doigts. Je prends mon petit pinceau plat. Et je vais utiliser un jaune. Je vais venir le mettre juste après mon blanc. Si jamais vous avez un jaune qui n'est pas suffisamment intense, vous pouvez mettre un peu plus de jumbo. Vous vous emmettez un peu plus loin et il vous servira de base à faire ressortir votre jaune. Ensuite, je prends un pinceau plat comme celui-ci, qui vient de chez melef. Je vais venir prendre un orange, Je prends un pinceau et je prends un pinceau estompeur propre Je reprends mon petit pinceau avec le caisse émise en jaune et je viens mettre juste au dessus du violet. Et je reprends mon pinceau estompeur et je le fonds du couleur rentrée. En 8, avec le même pinceau crayon, je viens prendre un rose fuchsia et je le mets entre mon orange et mon violet. Je reprends du violet sans essuie le pinceau et je refond le tout. Je reprends un petit peu de orange. Je vais prendre un autre pinceau sur lequel je vais mettre le pinceau. Et voilà, ensuite je prends le pinceau avec lequel on a mis le jaune, je reprends du jaune que je viens cette fois-ci mettre en ratil inférieur. Ensuite je prends mon crayon violet de chez BB Cosmetics et je le mets en ratil. Je prends mon pinceau crayon, je remets un petit peu du rose qu'on a utilisé entre le violet et l'orange. Je reprends du blanc avec un tout petit pinceau qui est normalement un pinceau de correcteur. Et je viens en remettre en coin interne. Et voilà. Je prends mon crayon violet et je fais mon râtile supérieur, alors légèrement. Ensuite je prends un pinceau bisopté, comme celui-ci. Et je viens fondre un petit peu. Je vais prendre du fleur violet, pour qu'on ait utilisé en coin externe et je ne mets pas dessus. Je termine avec mon mascara qui est toujours le bourgeois, Et voilà pour le maquillage des yeux. Pour mes lèvres, je décide d'utiliser un color pop stick chez je-mais, c'est pas bêtise, oui c'est ça, d'une teinte 080, donc le sherry pop. Je crois que j'ai toujours pas la mise au poisson entre le coeur, mais on se fallait commencer d'écrit, sherry pop et les 080. Donc il en fait, donc sherry pour moi, c'était rouge, il est plutôt orangé, donc il valait bien avec ce maquillage je pense. Et voilà, ce look à présent terminé. J'espère qu'il vous a plu, j'espère aussi que vous essayez de vous laisser et que vous n'êtes pas à poster les photos de vos réalisations sur mon mur de Facebook.

Comme ça même si je reste sur moi à battre un pokémon il montra de niveau. Cela nous prouve bien que les types sont très efficaces et très importants car le pokémon avait 4 niveaux de plus que moi et je le battais. Bon bah voilà, j'ai pas réussi à gagner. Je vais tenter de le faire maintenant avec les autres Pokémon qui me reste. Avoir réussi à lui faire perdre déjà deux Pokémon c'est incroyable. La potion a marché pour une fois. Voilà qui est bizarre et vraiment très ennuyeux. Ah non il va pas commencer à être des potions. Ça va pas le faire, on va pas être copains là. Mais pour une fois qu'il a des potions qui marchent, c'est pas du tout bon pour moi. Ok un coup critique et vous lire ici quand même à le battre. On a battu Auguste. C'est parfait, c'est parfait ça. On a pas encore battu un champion de type. Oh donc je pense que je vais d'abord mettre Pikachu devant. Tu veux être la timbre roquette ? Cors ! Ils vont pas nous lâcher. Qu'est ce qui est efficace ? On ne dit pas que c'est normal déjà, j'ai oublié. Allez Pikachu tu peux y arriver, tu peux le battre. Ah ouais mais avec tous ces jets de sable, ça va pas le faire. Bon voilà. Il est caolu aussi. Bon, bah apparemment... Ouais apparemment c'est vraiment quand il a un problème de statue et qu'il perd donc... un électèque qui... j'espère qu'il n'a pas une attaque électrique hein... Non mais j'ai pas tué quand même le champion de l'arrêt, je vais pas perdre quand la team roquette. Quoi qu'ils ont quand même des Pokémon puissants. Et j'ai pas l'avantage du type cette fois-ci. Super potion ! Mais depuis quand les potions elles font plus, elles font effets maintenant. Non, ça va plus. En avant Spectrum, pire au lit. Bon ça va Spectrum, il est efficace dans l'équipe. Ouais, arrêtez de mettre des super potions, vous m'ennuyez avec... Voilà. Personne ne fait face à du moquette.","We will try to beat the queen champion Even with our weak pokemon This problem Even if I was to beat a pokemon, he would show me a level This proves that the types are very effective Because the pokemon had only 4 levels more than me and I beat him Well, here I am I did not manage to win I will try to do it now with the other Pokémon that I have left. Having managed to make him lose two Pokémon is incredible. The potion worked for once. That's weird, it's really very boring. No, he won't start using potions. He won't do it, he won't be friends. But once he has potions that work, it's not good for me. Ok, a critical hit and you can still beat him. We haven't beat a type champion yet. So I think I'll put Pikachu in front of me. You see, Team Rocket. They won't let us go. What are the effects of normal Pokemon? You can beat them. With all these sand giants, it won't do it. He's Kaoru too. Well apparently... Yeah apparently it's really when he has a problem of status and he loses an electric attack. I hope he doesn't have an electric attack. No but I still beat the champion of the arena. I'm not going to lose against Team Rocket. They still have powerful Pokémon. And I don't have the advantage of the guy this time. Super potion. But since when the potions are no longer, they are in effect now. No, it's not working. A pyrrholy spectrum. It's working, Spectrum is efficient in the team. Yeah, stop putting super potions, you're bored with me. No one is facing a rocket."

Wil je in contact komen met het schoolmenschappelijk werk dan kun je altijd even via een docent op school vragen hoe dat kan. Ik hoop je te ontmoeten mocht dat nodig zijn. Ik ben heel erg benieuwd naar wat voor jullie dingen zouden zijn, waarmee je in contact zou willen komen met een hulpvereniging. Dus met de schoolman's schoolgewerken. Dat zijn onderwerpen waar je aan denkt. Ik heb er 5 van die vragen, lijst ofzo en die niet zo even. Ik vind dat die taarten geen bezoek van wat er allemaal is voor een paar stages. Wat zou je ervoor tegenhouden? Ik ben er niet altijd. Dus als het langduriger zou zijn, zou je de stap durven nemen. Ik heb jullie daar behoefte aan om daar in te zijn over andere onderwerpen door te brengen. Dat is voor onderwerpen dan. Om daar een wat meer over te weten. En zou je dat dan in een groep willen? Met je klas of zou je dat ook individueel doen? Juist het schoolmenschappelijk werken voor individuele gesprekken met de mensen. Dus ze kunnen je wedstrijd wat langer over door praten. Wat zou nou voor jullie dingen zijn waarvan je zegt dat je met iemand anders wil over praten dan met mijn vader, moeder of vriendinnen? Hoe je voelt. Stres heeft. Ja, hele goede dingen. Ja, noem je net al dat je gepest wordt. Of, nu komen ik wel vragen waarmee binnen van leerlingen te maken met gescheiden ouders. We zijn heel veel lasten aan het doen. Helpen jullie ook wel eens vriendinnen daarmee? Vragen die ze daar over hebben? Dus als ik daar praat, wil je ook over doen? Ja. Nou, wat ook terecht zijn, je hele goede vriendinnen. En jullie zijn ook vriendinnen van elkaar? Ja. Dus jullie helpen elkaar en stenen elkaar? Ja, altijd. Oké. Zal je ze allemaal aanhoek, jullie toestel? Ja. Dus ik zeg het zelf ook niet. Ja? Met wie doe je dat? Dus wie zou je daar over praten, als je... Ik wil mevrouw de geval. Want vanaf wat het is? Ja, dat is waar. Je hebt hier nog een voldreeg ter wereld, waar je je daar nog eens meer over wilt. Hebben jullie behoefte aan een sleutelhandel met een lampje? Ja, een lampje. En een spiegel zie je, daar heb je hier vast ook wel belangrijk bij. Dit is van internethulpverleningen. Als je het lastig vindt om de rechtsstreeks te stappen, te maken naar iemand die vragen waar je heel gevoelst op zegt, zou je het ook via internet kunnen. Om je mensen op de site te kijken. Ja, daar heb je daar het voldre.","Today I'm in the caravan of Jong Inop to get in touch with the students so that they know that there is always someone who can talk to them about their problems so that they know that they don't have to do it alone. If you want to get in touch with the school staff, you can always ask a teacher at school how that can be done. I hope you can meet them if necessary. Why didn't you come in? With what idea? I didn't know. I'm a student at the Zuider C College. Once a week I talk to young people about things they don't know about. I'm very curious about what things you would like to come into contact with and help with. What are your subjects? Have you often talked about other subjects? What did you guys think about the internet? Did you guys have a presentation of someone? Yes, and they were teachers of school? No, they were also talking about the toilet. I like the way they ask questions, the list and the messages. I think many people are talking about the first few stages. Many people think I have to do it with a beautiful stage. And it is certainly very important to do it with a beautiful stage, but not with a stage address. Who has a stage for the children? Just talking to the boys about it, that's not a problem. Do you know how you can get in touch with them? We are here now, so you learn from that. I have a follow-up where you can get a lot of information. Do you know that there are also coordinators at school? No, those are people who call me and I contact them. I could just be myself. Would you do that quickly? But I don't know. Where is that? It's very annoying. What would you do for a while? So if it would be more boring, you would be allowed to take the step. Do you have a need to talk about other subjects? What subjects? For example, the university. Because there is more to know. And would you want to be in a group? With your class? Or would you want to be an individual? Because it is the school of social work that helps individual conversations. So you can talk about it for a long time. What would be your thoughts on this? I would like to talk to someone else about this. My father, my mother or my friends. How do you feel? Do you feel stressed? Yes, very good things. You mentioned that you are getting stressed. I can ask questions about my family, my parents, who are very difficult. Do you help your friends with this? Questions that you have about this? So when we talk about it, you are really good friends. Are you friends with each other? Yes. So you help each other and support each other? Yes, always. So you are friends with each other? Yes. Who do you do that with? So when you talk about it, who do you talk to? I talk to my father. Because of what it is. I want to give you a full picture of what you would like if you had more information about your children. Do you need a key? A lamp? And a mirror. You have it here. It's important to borrow internet help. If you find it difficult to make the most right-wing steps to someone who asks you for help, you should also look for your internet. You have to look at the site. Yes, you have it there."

The show was called the Parade of Suivirintets. Almost all the members of the Republic of the Soviet Union came to the show. At the end of the eighties, in the nineties, the communism was a major movement of national organizations. I have made a brief report on the history of the Russian occupation, to understand what the causes of the Russian occupation of the 21st century are. The first war in 1996 began with Russian authorities as the need to carry out constitutional orders. The first war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was the general power of the Khacharinovsky-Bariata, the second war was Russia wanted to limit its sovereignty over the territory of Russia. The first is to speak to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people of Russia, to the people But the next, a severe criminal situation in the Czech Republic, the increase of radical Islam in the Czech Republic, the reduction of the detachment of the commandant Shamil Basarov from the neighboring Dagestan, the explosion of the Russian home, led to the new war. The operations of the Basel of Dagestan and the explosions of the houses of habitation in various ways supported a new state. But in these holes, the investigation of the Russian intelligence is very often carried out.

Cosa è successo? È spiegato che perché abbiamo una buona classifica, una buona condizione perché alla fine dell'ultimo periodo lo siamo cresciuto, però ancora abbiamo questa doppia personalità che c'è una differenza totale con le partite in casa e fuori. Anche oggi siamo entrati in campo timorosi, infaurite, sembravamo i primi 15 minuti. e hanno sbloccato la partita meritatamente. Poi ci siamo riorganizzati, siamo entrati in partita e abbiamo creato qualche pericolo. Una altra volta entro in campo, abbiamo commesso certamente delle ingenità sui gol che siamo un po' più sul suo partito. che è un doppio volto all'intero dei repati. In difesa, credo che sia la squadra più battuta del campo esterno. Anche in casa, ancora il problema della difesa non è stato del tutto sistema. Prende trovi gomini. È un problema purtroppo anche dei uomini perché ogni settimana siamo costretti a cambiare, a fare la formazione in base a chi è disponibile sia per infrotture, sia per scuolefica ed è un periodo e si riuscì a farlo bene. e abbiamo un problema che è diventato psicologico che non aiuta a dare continuità perché abbiamo fatto due buoni gari da tutti i punti di vista e è impensabile da una partita all'altra si entra in campo come abbiamo fatto noi oggi. che avrebbero avuto un fattore psicologico perché appena gli avversari sbloccano la partita o hanno qualche opportunità dal punto di vista psicologico, c'è di algo. Oggi c'erano anche problemi perché avevamo molte essenze perché certamente avere qualche giocatore che veniva da una sensata lungata o qualcuno che si deve inserire e qualche altro che non gioca da tempo, scusate, negli 11 iniziali, certamente Questo ha fatto il resto però ripeto non bisogna sempre cercare attenuanti perché commettiamo degli errori con squadra schierata che andiamo a golque. Succediamo che non ci fanno crescere. Mi volta che creiamo qualcosa di buono prendiamo una bastonata e così non va bene. Certamente dobbiamo correre il medio, da l'aspiananza di recuperare qualcuno. Soprattutto prendiamo delle ammonizioni che costano tanto che anche il mercoledino Seconda metà del primo tempo però poi quando subiamo gol in quella maniera il 2-0 ci ha tagliato un po' le gambe tra virgolette e quindi sono riapparsi i fantasmi delle altre partite e se ho visto nettamente che abbiamo un allato e con la testa. Non accade frequentemente che all'alettura della formazione ci sia un applauso importante da parte di tutto lo stadio, lei ha sentito gli applausi Purtroppo oggi rimasto solo a Claude, poi sono stato un po' merigio da Incoopo perché non riuscì a vedere la squadra che ha visto una settimana forte. Mister, dopo il primo gol, l'abbiamo visto sistemare un modo diverso di uomini in campo, forse non ci aspettava un catania così? Abbiamo cercato di cambiare perché non è un... diciamo così... Quando non riesci a fare la partita e ti adatta agli adversari, significa che ancora dobbiamo crescere. Ci siamo dovuti adattare gli altri e questo certamente non è stato piacevole. Se parti bene con la tua idea, la devi portare a termine, è stato negli ultimi partiti. Ma fuori casa probabilmente non riusciamo ancora a fare questo. Il più fastidio è se si ricordava un rischio così inforzi, ma anche è da molto bene l'amore. Catania ha fatto una buona partita, ha meritato. Mi è problema da risolvere, devo guardare a risolvere dei problemi del genere. Con colpire i tibiti del solitario all'inizio della partita, ci vorrà contare cosa avete detto? Non, non mi raccomando, ci sono tonti e ci sono stati usati un ultimo rapporto. Il giocatore di Giardino è deciso di cambiare, atteggendo talpo all'inizio della gara, ma in spazio per il 0-1 o soltanto sul 4-0 probabilmente erano tutti i primi atteggi di offensione. è un atteggiamento diverso dall'inizio sarebbero stati più grossi.","It's a great game, but there's no way to get the ball back. What happened? We're in a good shape because we've improved a lot. We still have this personality, which is a huge difference for the players. We entered the pitch today, we were afraid and scared for the first 15 minutes. We stopped on the pitch, the other players did what they wanted and they lost the game deservedly. Then we reorganized, we entered the game and we had to create some danger. Another time we entered the pitch, we certainly made some ingenuity on the goals that we have achieved on the game. It's a problem for men too, because every week we're able to change the formation based on the available players, We're going to overcome certain situations with a bit more aggressive approach, we'll do better in the game and we'll be able to do well. As soon as we lower the ball a bit, we'll continue to score, maybe the guys play out of the game, we have to pass the defensive line, we'll do this as well. We made some mistakes in the goal, but we avoided them. We have this problem that has become psychological, which doesn't help us to continue because we had two good games, from all aspects of the game. It's unthinkable that from one game to another we can go into the field, as we did today. We also had a psychological factor because as soon as the opponents block the game or have some chances from the psychological point of view, we give up. Today there were also problems because we had a lot of essence because certainly having some players who came from a long sense or someone who must be involved and some others who have not played for a long time, excuse me, in the early 11, certainly This has been done by the rest, but we need to be careful because we make mistakes with the team we're playing with. We're playing with the team we're playing with and we're not getting any better. When we create something good, we take a step back and we have to run through the hope of recovering someone, especially when we try to take some ammunition that will cost us a lot. but when we scored, 2-0 cut us a bit. The games are like the other games, if I saw that we were on the side with the right side. Unfortunately, today I'm the only one left. I'm the only one who's been applauded. I was a little bit of a coward because I couldn't have won the team I saw a few times. Mr. Rodolfo, the first goal we saw was to make the man in the field different. Maybe you didn't expect a team like that. We tried to change it because it's not like that. When you can't play and adapt to the opponents, it means that we still have to grow. We had to adapt to the others and this certainly wasn't pleasant. If you play well with your idea, you have to bring it to the end, it was one of the last games. But at home we probably still can't do this. I'm more tired of being in the same position as you, but I'm happy with the result. Catania did a good game, deserved it. I have problems to solve, so I have to look at the problems of the game. Mr. Complicio, you were playing against the club. No, no. Mr. Complicio, the absence of the team has decided to change the game, because you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against the club, but you were playing against It's fundamental to maintain a certain system of play, because it makes the team get out and dance, with different characteristics. Thinking of a different attitude from the beginning would be more important."

IwT-r91kGCU,342,605,500,480,320,30.0,30.0,h264,News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwT-r91kGCU,"Brainwashed One: Torture, Fiction, and Suppression","Some thoughts about the transformation of our society into one that accepts disgraceful acts of torture, and how fundamentalism has contributed to this.    Song ""Void"" by Gregory 'Tha Silent Partner' Davis","Wrayer, Brainwashed, Torture",8194,125,17,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/IwT-r91kGCU.mp3,"Brainwashed one, torture, fiction, and suppression. A few decades ago torture was understood to be the kind of thing that only the criminally insane could contemplate. It was regarded as the ultimate nightmare and the idea of an entire society can toning such an act was unthinkable. What a difference a few years can make. Items such as stun guns, which used to only be found in the most depraved dungeons of the world's worst tyrants, suddenly found their way into the hands of police officers to be used outdoors on the general public. Chemical weapons have been used in the streets by authorities with equal enthusiasm. And somehow, people at home have approved this measure as a way of dealing with too many people walking down the street at the same time. What changed? Remember back to 1971 when a clockwork orange hit the theaters. The pure evil of harming others was never made more clear than in the series of rapes, assaults, and acts of humiliation perpetrated by the main characters. When captured they are tortured and brainwashed into being unable to commit such crimes We are taught however that an eye for an eye is no solution and that free will must come first The damage to their psyches is undone despite the fact that they were evil or perhaps deserved it a wrong must never be answered by a wrong We were once powerful enough as a society to understand this Even in the 1980s. This was abundantly clear I remember with absolute horror a scene on the popular television show Miami Vice as a principal bad guy put one bullet after another into the legs of a captured agent. The implication was clear. Such an act put one beyond any redemption. In 1987 and 88 with the first two Hellraiser movies, torture was shown as the sole dominion of the devil himself. Suddenly in 1995 we are asked to become fascinated with torture in the movie 7. Irony and wit are used not to justify torture outright but to endear the torture in question to the audience so that we may identify with them. By the time Saw rolled around in 2004, the audience was fully prepared to consider the torturer's justification for the acting question and was far less interested in what the victim had to say. However, these perspectives do not restrict themselves to thriller flicks. The popular television show Lost reverses this perspective The heroes commit the act of torture three separate times, and yet the implication in this case is that it was something necessary and reasonable, like, say, murder. Further, the reality of torture is glossed over, as the victims easily recover with no mental scarring, and the gibbering nonsense that, in the real world, usually emits from a torture victim's mouth, never materializes.

A few decades ago torture was understood to be the kind of thing that only the criminally insane could contemplate. It was regarded as the ultimate nightmare and the idea of an entire society can toning such an act was unthinkable. What a difference a few years can make. Items such as stun guns, which used to only be found in the most depraved dungeons of the world's worst tyrants, suddenly found their way into the hands of police officers to be used outdoors on the general public. Chemical weapons have been used in the streets by authorities with equal enthusiasm. And somehow, people at home have approved this measure as a way of dealing with too many people walking down the street at the same time. What changed? Remember back to 1971 when a clockwork orange hit the theaters. The pure evil of harming others was never made more clear than in the series of rapes, assaults, and acts of humiliation perpetrated by the main characters. When captured they are tortured and brainwashed into being unable to commit such crimes. We are taught however that an eye for an eye is no solution and that free will must come first. The damage to their psyches is undone despite the fact that they were evil or perhaps deserved it. A wrong must never be answered by a wrong. We were once powerful enough as a society to understand this. Even in the 1980s, this was abundantly clear. I remember with absolute horror a scene on the popular television show Miami Vice as a principal bad guy put one bullet after another into the legs of a captured agent. The implication was clear. Such an act put one beyond any redemption. In 1987 and 88 with the first two Hellraiser movies, torture was shown as the sole dominion of the devil himself. Suddenly in 1995 we are asked to become fascinated with torture in the movie 7. Irony and wit are used not to justify torture outright but to endear the torture in question to the audience so that we may identify with them. By the time Saw rolled around in 2004, the audience was fully prepared to consider the torturer's justification for the acting question and was far less interested in what the victim had to say. However, these perspectives do not restrict themselves to thriller flicks. The popular television show Lost reverses this perspective The heroes commit the act of torture three separate times, and yet the implication in this case is that it was something necessary and reasonable, like, say, murder. Further, the reality of torture is glossed over, as the victims easily recover with no mental scarring, and the gibbering nonsense that, in the real world, usually emits from a torture victim's mouth never materializes. Is this an attempt by the studios to plant a particular perspective in the minds of the viewers, or is it a reaction to the After all, the argument that if the enemy, whoever they are, used torture, whenever that's happened, we must too. Such unthinkable idiocy would never have been emitted from the lips of a North American a few decades ago. But now this sentiment is voiced regularly. Why?

You accept the existence of Israel? Yes, I accept it to make ceasefire between Palestinians and Israelis. Somebody said to you, we should set to Palestinians, you should recognize Israel. And Israel, you should recognize Palestinians. that you must know about Palestine Some people say this If you watch this video, you will not feel that there is any problem in the word of the devil They also want to tell you that it is clear that the devil says that some people Some people say this And in the end, the devil did not say this The real thing we want to tell you is that we are the fabricators of this video to make ceasefire between Palestinians and Israelis. We can make even a long ceasefire but we should set to Palestinians you should recognize Israelis and Israel you should recognize Palestinians. Let's explain what we did. One second. What happened here? The camera changed. And the guy in the open was not in the way. And here, he could put any words of the open in any other answer and continue. So we removed the sentence that he says. And we put it in another sentence. The music is asked by the opening and he says, is Israel accepted? The music is answered and he says yes, it is accepted by the ceasefire between the Israeli and the Palestinians. First thing you see is that the meeting is supposed to take place in two cameras. The camera on the music and the camera on the opening. If you look at the original recording, The issue does not appear once, and it is the Doctor of the Open. This means that the issue can be solved by the second phase. And then, the issue of the opening is put before the talks. And this is very easy, let me show you. What if the Palestinians decide to leave Palestine and the Al-Aqsa Mosque to live with the Jews under the Israeli state? The government of Abu Al-Futuh sent the Qasah Mosque and all other issues in it and said that the Palestinians are right and the Qasah Mosque is their right and they do what they want. The truth is that this was the answer to the Qasah to the people in the choice they make whether it is an Islamic or not. And of course, he was talking about Egypt, not about Palestine. Let's hear it. The second thing is that when the marriage changed and the appearance of the woman appeared, it was very clear that the movement of the woman was not walking with a dog. And he was walking and he was walking very close to the man. When the man was still in the car, his hand was not in the same place. His hand was below. This is because the situation was better than the other. If we continue with the words, we will find that the words are the words of the past in the end, in a normal way. Even the word Palestine is complete. And this means that in the end of the words, there is another sentence in the past, so that we can communicate with it. And the third thing, if we go in the direction, we will find another word. The second to the opening is to say that the Palestinians and the Arabs are doing the occupation And he also said that Palestine is a Palestinian right, not an Israeli right. We are not going to take this as a joke. The last thing is that the decision is clear that it is made during the revolution. In the resolution studio, people are still talking about the Egyptian revolution. They are also talking about the arrival of the Cairo people. But when we look at the revolution, and the doctor who was with the music, we discovered that he was photographed in 2009. It is clear that they used it again. Here, I will let you think about it. The doctor was always asked by the doctors, who asked him to be a doctor. The doctor was always asked by the doctors, who asked him to be a doctor. The doctors were always asked by the doctors, who asked him to be a doctor. The doctors were always asked by the doctors, who asked him to be a doctor. I'm going to be a good person"

Muchas veces ponemos nuestras esperanzas en una mina que encontramos en algún lugar. Pero si buscamos lo que va para la vida eterna, permanecerá para siempre. Por eso es necesario que tu fe, que nuestra fe, la pongamos solamente en Cristo. Cristo es el amigo que nunca falla. Él sabía tu necesidad. Él sabía lo que tú ibas a necesitar. Él sabía que un día ibas a sentir sola, que te ibas a sentir solo. Él sabía que un día ibas a sentir. pero sabía que se lo ponía dentro de ustedes en el pecho. Pero hablaba y subía con fe.

Sólo Dios sabe los sacrificios que Él pasó para poder subir después de una noche de desveno, de una noche de asoco, de una noche que lo pusieron por una despida, de una noche que se volvaban de él. Pero ahí iba feliz a la cruz del Calvario porque sabía que ahí arriba iba a alcanzar tu victoria, tu salvación. Iba a pagar el precio de tu sanidad, el precio de tu porque arriba no hay bebederos de agua, no hay nada más que monte, no hay nada más que algunos árboles, no hay nada más que el viento que sopla, pero ahí estaba la presencia de Dios.

My eyes come from heaven, what did I do? I always, I always pray. It is time my brothers to look for the things inside. It is time to take away your hope and things that have come to you, the things that have come to you, many times we put our hopes in a girl that we found in some place but if we look for what goes for eternal life will remain forever that is why it is necessary that your faith, that our faith, we put it only in Christ Christ who is the friend who never fails He knew your need, He knew what you were going to need and He knew that one day you were going to feel alone, that you were going to feel alone He knew that one day you were going to feel and you would start to entomb the people who were passing by, or you would have to find yourself in front of an incursion, in which you didn't know which way you were taking. But my Lord Jesus, did not start taking your humanity, our humanity, carrying a cross to Mount Carvalho. Many years before, you had also gone up and carried a deer, to Mount Timor, and that is the same mountain. And in that mountain, God made a miracle. Can you imagine you hugging your son, carrying a deer with a knife, but I knew that I could not enter you in the chest, but I was going up with faith. My Lord Jesus went up with faith to Mount Calvary, carrying that cross, only God knows the sacrifices that He went through to be able to go up after a night of despair, a night of shock, a night that was made by a spiral, a night that was made by Him, but I was happy at the cross of the Calvary, because I knew that there I would go and I would reach your victory, your salvation, and I would pay the price of your health, the price of your life, Brother, God is calling his people to climb the mountain. To climb the mountain of prayer. God is calling you to put in your heart to enter the presence of God. The more we seek the Lord, the more your face shines. Do you remember when Moisés climbed to Mount Sinai? He was there 40 days and 40 nights in the Mount Sinai. Moisés, brother, no, there was nothing. because above there are no water springs, there is nothing more than a mountain, there is nothing more than some trees, there is nothing more than the wind that blows, but there was the presence of God, Moses ascended and ascended to 40 days and 40 nights and when he lowered his face he was telling him, do you know why? because there was a presence of God, when you go up to the mountain of prayer, when you pray constantly, when you let the presence of God God falls on you when you have a prayer and you say to him, I am here when you are praying but you are not asking for anything, you are only saying his name when you are praying but you do not ask for grace only with temple and the Lord and exalt his wonderful man there, there my brother is your answer, we add to the mountain of the hand because the mountain of the prayer is your answer God knows what you are living and God knows the anguish you had You have been in anguish for eight days now. The difficult moment that you were waiting for has already happened. Now the Lord comes again and wants to take your hand. He wants to tell you that I am here. Give me your hand. I will guide you.

So here's how you play it The chords are simple. I think you know all of them, but it's just a matter of playing in the right order So the first quarter the whole song you're gonna bar first second and third strings on the second fret and then with your let's say ring finger you're gonna fourth string fourth fret so again looks like this so again try to sing like Jagger it's gonna sound terrible so you know really funny you switch this is easy to do that second chord you switch to is just a G chord and you know how to play this you can embellish if you want to hammer on With your pinky whatever so again The next core is just an a minor forget the middle finger a minor is just a one finger second fret that top string fourth string And then it's another super easy core to C core which is just one finger And then a quick transition. So what that transition is, is A minor. It's a D. So what I'm doing is I'm just fretting on the second fret, the fourth, third, and second string. You could borrow two, but I like to do it with three fingers. So. And then back to that D. and all I'm doing there is those three fingers but then I'm sliding my ring finger from the second fret to the third fret and then back to that first thing. The chorus is A minor, super easy. To an F, which is just a kind of A minor. It's like the first chord in postcards in Middle, Beirut. So again. So I'll do a whole verse. I'm just playing it without stopping. You can do it. I know you can. Okay. Let me know if you have any more questions or follow-up videos.

Le premier sentiment c'est qu'il y a beaucoup d'idées, beaucoup de créativité, on sent qu'ils ont vraiment bien planché, d'en bosser. Après, c'est aussi amusant de voir les différences entre les groupes, entre les groupes très scolaires et très académiques, ceux qui partent plus dans les tours avec des idées un peu plus farfelues. Et en tout cas, c'est super intéressant pour nous chez l'annonceur, qui n'avons pas forcément toujours le temps de beaucoup travailler et de brainstormer comme ça, d'avoir toute leur richesse. On est souvent dans nos réflexes de façon travaillée ou de communiqué et là ça nous amène plein de nouvelles idées, c'est très enrichissant. parce qu'on a très rapidement sauté le travers, on a pas de rédéance sur son quotidien et il est doublé prendre un coup de hauteur pour chocer les relativés. et en essayant de cette émulation de sortir des choses petites.","and the Riband will be broken in the next 60 years. So we found it interesting to propose this event in the 60 years of study for the ECS to work on a marketing communication plan of things we could do next year to make these 60 years known to consumers. The first feeling is that there are many ideas, many creativity. We feel that they are really well set. It's also fun to see the differences between groups, between very school and academic groups, those who go more in the tours with more ideas. It's really interesting for us, for the announcers, who don't always have the time to work and brainstorm, to have all their wealth. It gives us the new ideas, the modern side. We are often in our reflexes of working in communication and it gives us a lot of new ideas and very interesting. Continuing to be interested in a lot of things, what we really liked is to have feelings that they really worked under this case and that it gave them pleasure. It's a case that is not normal. The feeling that it's true. And in any case, they continue to invest in cases that will happen later. And to remain curious, We have to help them on their daily basis and forget about them in a high school to help them to get rid of the negative. I can tell you that the advice I have given them is to keep this spirit of life and not to be afraid of anything. They try to do things without the budget and they try to create them. and trying to get out of this emulation of things."

This antenna is designed to operate between 25 megahertz and a 1300 megahertz. The construction itself of the antenna is fairly high quality with all the supporting hardware and the elements are all made of stainless steel. The assembly is fairly quite simple with a nothing really major you have to do. The wide band nature of these Disco antennas means you can also transmit on them. over the VHF and the OHF handbands to get the 6 meter response which is the 50 megahertz response. The antenna comes with a loading coil and a whip antenna that mounts on top of the cone element like that. If you don't require the 50 megahertz response, the antenna will operate without this top loading coil. You just replace it with the standard The main body of the radio is made of 8 radials, making up the cone element. The radials are about 3 feet long. There are also 8 horizontal disc elements. The antenna is not at DC ground. Make sure you have a poly phaser or some sort of a surge or lightning protection or otherwise you can zap your radio. Probably the biggest drawback to the antenna is the cone elements use stainless steel tubing and they have these little crimp connectors threaded inserts that they crimp into the tubing. What happens is as the antenna is flopping around in the wind like that it will eventually break off an element or so. I had it happen a couple times. So what I do is I try to get some number eight aluminum all thread from the hardware store. And it should come in like three foot sections and just replace the cone element with a threaded all rod. You still want to add a little bit of Loctite onto the threads and use the locking nut. That'll make a really secure connection. It should last through snow storms or wind storms or stuff like that. I do add a little bit of a RTB sealant to this plastic insulator. It should just unscrews and you can add a little bit of a sealant to it. And also to the top here, otherwise water can seep down the threads into your center conductor. It uses a SO 239 and the disc element just compresses down on top. You do want to keep the elements in line when you after you secure the antenna like you know after you kind of line the cone element and the disc element in line like that and then when you tighten down the top nut or the top loading coil that just helps increase the performance of the antenna. It comes with this short little aluminum tube to mount which then gets mounted to your mast or whatever that just connects into the body of the You can also mount the antenna upside down on a tripod or something that's really handy. You can just break down, you can mount it upside down on a tripod or something or stick it in your attic or whatever. That way you don't have to fiddle with all the other multi hardware options. Other than the tubing elements, this is a fairly high quality antenna. I really like it. I actually have like three of them. One of the little secrets of this antenna is that you can actually transmit on the FM broadcast band with it. So if you ever need a quick pirate radio antenna, pick up one of these. You want to keep the frequency above 100 megahertz between 100 and 108 FM band but it does work in a pinch and I know several people that use them for a low power FM.","This is an overview of the Radio Shack Disco antenna.

And what the properties of Before we take a closer look at the different types of reactors, we want to look at the main differences. First of all, the fuel. In the natural origin of the Uranium, there are about 99.3% of the non-spalding Uranium 238 and only 0.7% of the spalding Uranium 235. The enrichment of Uran is a very complicated and expensive process. So it is a great plus point when the reactor uses normal Uran.

Which he does, very, very effectively. As you can see these one-hit kills really are causing the opposition pain. That guy sneaks around the side and next place I cop some straight in the face. He's still parading around here making sure these guys can't push through which means they have to funnel through the other two doors and even then he's still causing some serious damage. The Spass shotgun as well as other shotguns seems to be pretty popular in the Top 5 players recently.

Unlucky. Nice clip. exposure bolt, he's just shot a part of the building and killed about 6 people. So you can probably guess what he's going to keep doing, he's really going to use that exposure bolt, take down bits of debris, and we'll just plant them on the opposition track and push forward to arm those income. Thus far it's proved very, very effective and like everything, if it works for you, keep doing it. No one will certainly forget Zarkis Gamer, he had a squished people with tanks or basically squashes them with buildings. Very, very sneaky Battlefield player. Well done! Just his sole focus of this clip or this match or whatever he was doing was to take out the aerial threat which he does very very effectively.

Sie nimmt den Full HD auf oder 720p mit 60 Frames pro Sekunde. Ich habe mich heute schon ausprobiert. Funktioniert super. Ein ausführliches Review wird kommen. Wo ich dann Sportaufnahmen zeige, Wasseraufnahmen, Kloa, Salzwasser, normale Aufnahmen. Die Kamera ist schön kompakt. Ich habe mich für die entschieden. Erst wollte ich diese Flip Minus HD oder so. aber die hatte bei Amazon keine guten Kundenrezitionen und ja die kann man mit unter Wasser nehmen und alles voll HD sogar finde ich klasse und wenn ihr euch jetzt fragt wieso hat der 2 Kameras? Hast du zu viel Geld? Nein habe ich nicht das ist die Kamera mit der ich hier aufnehme die von meiner Mutter war die darf ich halt aber auch mal benutzen und das hier ist jetzt sozusagen meine in Anführungszeichen werden vielleicht auch ein paar Videos folgen.

First I wanted this Flip-HD or something. but they had no good customer reception on Amazon and you can take them with you underwater and everything is full HD I think it's great and if you ask why the 2 cameras have too much money I don't have that's the camera I'm recording here, which was from my mother but I can use it and this is my one in terms of performance I will follow some videos. I'll do it here. And then you can see it. But as I said, the video will come. You can look forward to it. That will be cool. And yes, thank you for watching and peace."

We're going to start off with the top left, center, and bottom right. It's a basic how it is when you're done with that you're gonna go to edit define pattern same scan lines 01 save Now let's go ahead and use white You can switch or toggle with arrow keys here or girls use the shortcut, which is X on your keyboards We'll ask the default keyboard setting if you change it. I don't know look to you Go ahead and replace the black with the white color so top left center and bottom right same thing edit define pattern same scan lines oh two click okay you can do the same thing going other direction bottom left center top right edit define pattern scan lines three okay toggle to different color black those same ones bottom left center top right. Define pattern scan lines 04 and then there's one more you can do. It's your horizontal one but it's usually called like holographic or something but it's a different size. We'll do that in a different tutorial. Now let's go ahead and show how to use them. Let's go ahead and start off a new file. Let's go ahead and make it any size. I'll just go ahead and use 500 or 500 pixels. Click OK. We'll go ahead and get our shape. Let's go to Layer, Layer Style, Stroke, Pattern Overlay. I usually change the opacity to about 30 to 15. You can have like text around it. I know it's up to you Same thing with the black with the white ones just change the color Click okay We'll switch to the white ones go in the other direction click okay, you can see them there. I like that. It's really cool sort of Make a more visual 100 make this 20. Whoops just kidding 15 See you got the like toggle around here and there just to make it work to your preferences Sorry, I had some fruit punch earlier. So you just mess around with that however you want. You could also make a selection. You pick a selection until you want to use. We'll go ahead and use our rectangle marquee. Make a selection. Make sure you make a new layer. The shortcut is down here. The little layer box down there. Create a new layer. Or layer, new layer. Or too many layers. Okay? Right click, Fill, Color, Pattern, and normal opacity 100. two sideways arrow things you can move around your passage like that just letting you guys know I didn't know that for a while until I took a class at community college and I was like well we could do that cool alright sorry it's like really late right now I'm out of it and yeah it's basically I made the simple scan lines how you use them you could also make your selection last until so it only goes on like one little layer piece I don't know what you want to call it But yeah. Alright guys, I hope you enjoyed this video. Leave it in the comments or suggestions. Something you think I should fix on this video, because it's probably a lot.

I'm gonna make quick Photoshop tutorial on how to make scan lines I'm gonna be using a W Photoshop CS4 extended It does work on the previous versions as well though All right, so let's go ahead and start off with a new file There's no need to really name it since we're not gonna save it width and height. Let's make it three pixels each background content transparent Click OK. Zoom in as much as possible. We'll take our pencil tool, locate it on the left side next to the brushes. We're going to go to brush size, 1 pixel. Mode, normal, opacity 100. So let's go ahead and start off with our two main colors that you might use, black and white.

Für die Familienväter die jeden Hilfe ablehnen, arbeiten gehen bis zu ihrem Ableben hart bleiben auf Sie können nichts dafür, Sie haben es gelernt von den Erwachsenen.

Keine Panik, kein Gelaber, weil die Finger nicht zur Vorfügt. Ich blicke hinauf und staun, ich kann den Mann im Himmel wieder taun. Ich mach die Flimmerkiste aus und wie Alsthinde, ich fahr mal Bock und sowas gerade hier passiert ist, was mir geht, das hier nach Opus. Ich blicke wieder ins Licht, der miese Schatten fängt zu weichern. Rising Sun, nicht mehr Tag und Nacht, die wie in die Scheiße fallen. Und soll das Mathmar krachen, kriege ich Liebe aus dem Heimatland. Ein Brief um meiner Kleinkantasch und reich, nur mich einzufangen. Ich fühl mich wie ein Rieser, wie ein Kaiser, wie ein König und kann fliegen ohne Eis einweichen. Jetzt einfach wieder schönes doch gewöhn mich nicht daran Denn hast du uns da leben fliegt es dich entfalsch Ich rück an diesen Ackerbrach legen Und nicht in Lass uns weiter träumen Uns einfach freuen Lass uns machen und das Rad wieder rumdrehen Knablose träuchts Joch nicht tatenlos zu sehen Denn dann kommt irgendwann der Tag an dem stunde 0 schlägt doch schlägt Lass uns weiter träumen Uns einfach freuen Lass uns machen und das Rad wieder rumdrehen Knablose träuchts Joch nicht tatenlos zu sehen Denn dann kommt irgendwann der Tag an dem stunde 0 schlägt SWR 2020","This is the Mucke for the undershift.

Just get back to your senses, but don't get used to it, because otherwise you'll be alive. If you're wrong, I'll hit you with this axe. Don't let us go on. Just let us do it and turn the wheel around. No touch. Don't look at me without a tattoo, because then the day will come when we'll hit the clock. Just let us do it and turn the wheel around.

This is Homjack and I'm back with some more majestic map pack gameplay. This time I'm on Monolith. I've got a beam rifle which is pretty sweet because the beam rifle actually spawns on this map. The two of them, one on each side. And so I thought I'd just talk a bit about each of the three maps that come with the majestic map pack. It's Monolith, Skyline, and Landfall is the last one. I think this one right here, Modeleth, is my favorite so far. It's symmetrical, it's kind of medium sized I guess. And it plays well, it played Slayer and Regicide and King of the Hill on it. It's all pretty good. Like I said, the two beam rifles, beam rifle is a beast. It's just a machine. My friend compared it to Revy sniping in Halo Reach. It's got almost that amount of auto aim, just like it's ridiculous. But anyway, it's fun to use. There's also rockets on this map they spawn in the middle. I think they just came up in the gameplay. But yeah, this map's got a lot going on, you know, it's pretty good. And the next map is Skyline. I put up a video of Skyline before. It was just gameplay though, no commentary. And it's a pretty good map too. I especially like capture the flag on skyline. It's one of those maps where You even if you get the flag out of their base it can be a real struggle to actually capture it There are a lot of different routes you could run the flag, but It's a pretty small map so like the enemies are always gonna be working to cut you off and return that flag So it can get pretty intense I'd say any more than 4v4 on skyline would be pushing it as to how many people it can actually support. But it's a good small map. Now the last one is called Landfall and I'm sorry but this has got to be my least favorite of the three. It just it has some indoor and outdoor parts but all the action gravitates towards the indoors turns into kind of a camp fest with an occasional journey outside to go get the rockets when they spawn. I mean it's an asymmetrical map. It feels like you should play one sided flag or assault on it, except that those game types aren't in Halo 4. But I think the most fun game type I've played on Landfall is extraction, since that makes you move around the map at least a little bit to the different extraction points. So, yeah, Landfall, not my favorite. Also, does the layout of it remind anyone else of Longshore from Halo 3? I think that's what it was called. It was a DLC map. I like the Majestic Map Pack a lot. I think it has some of the best maps we've seen in Halo 4, better than Crimson, Map Pack, and while I'm talking about maps, I just want to mention two Forge maps that have made it into matchmaking recently. Relay and Shutout, which is a lockout release. make. I've had fun with both of those recently. Now moving on to some other stuff, there were two announcements in the last couple weeks or so that were both pretty interesting. First, Bungie made a new video about Destiny, their new game that they're working on. And so I'm pretty excited about that. It looks kind of like a mix between Halo and Borderlands with a big focus on co-op and playing with a group of friends, but I don't really care to speculate that much. The game is still pretty far away. So, the other, the second thing is that Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4, and even though I don't really plan on getting one, it's still cool to see stuff coming out about the new consoles. I would assume Microsoft will announce the next Xbox sometime, sometime. And, you know, I probably won't get that out of launch either but whatever. I hope you enjoyed the video.

Just want to talk to you this morning about our pollstered goods. Everything that we have in our store that is a pollstered is American made. We are proud of that fact. We like to tell people about that because I think you're probably just as concerned about that as I am getting something that's American made. In particular, we have our Weavercraft pollstery label sofa here. There's many frames that we have in our store. And I just love to talk about our Weavercraft upholstery label because we stamp it with our name just like our wood furniture. We can have these sofas done up shorter, longer, deeper, shallower. We also can do some custom things, which we've done for several people, making up a custom sofa. And what I'd like about our Weavercraft upholstery label label is the fact that there's so few manufacturers nowadays that put a nice quality products into the sofas. First of all, our Reavercraft upholstery has a spring edge front right on the very front of the sofa. The reason why you want that is it gives you a nice bouncy comfortable feel in your sofa and also it helps to keep your fabric from wearing in the front most companies will put just a board across there, a very rigid board that has no give to it and over time it just doesn't wear as good as your spring edge. Another thing that weaver craft upholstery has is an eight-way hand-tied coil. This coil is literally tied off in eight different directions, either to the frame or to another coil. And this is the oldest coil system known to man and the most comfortable. It's a very nice coil. quality product. With our Weavercraft upholstery label, we have Weavercraft tables to go along with your living room suits. They, once again, are made of solid wood, your choice of wood. We've done some custom work once again for people to duplicate perhaps a grandmother's or a mother's table that they remember growing up with. And it just brings back memories to them whenever we recreated these tables. We do carry another line called England, which is an American made upholstery as well. And they're the fastest shipping custom order company in the business. Usually we can get their product in our warehouse once it's ordered in three weeks or less. Which there's, as far as I know, nobody out there ships quicker than they do. But we like to tell people that we have an American made product. We're proud of that. And I just like to invite you, please, once again, come into our store and see what we have to offer to you. We can ship it to you no matter where you're at.

I'm making my baby gun review on a AK-47 This gun is 365 FPS and It's mad holds about 400 rounds So it's pretty good gun So this is the gun right here so unfortunately I live in Canada so The guns clear Right here. So if I did kind of take it out. It was pretty honest so the grip is really nice hard plastic you can't it's just you have to I don't know if you can see it but there's kind of a screw right here that you have to unscrew take it off the grip the trigger is metal I have no clue what you call the same but it's really good really nice and firm so it comes with its own battery so you don't have to worry about that it's recyclable battery cycle. So yeah it takes about 6 hours to charge that up once you get this gun. So here's the mag right here. Okay, mag is really nice actually. It's a metal mag I think. Oh sorry it's plastic. Feels like metal though. So it has obviously this thing that pulls up your BBs into the mag. So yeah let's look at the gun. So to put the mag in you kind of got to put forward first and then just kind of pull it in Push it in from the back. It's kind of hard. There we go. It's hard to do it with one hand So you pull it in like that. Yeah, the guns decently heavy Okay, it's turned over here Just like all the AKs it has kind of the safe right here full auto semi auto this yeah Obviously sense the battery. Yes an electric gun for us to see that start The iron sights are that bad really like it's not the greatest, but it's pretty decent So it has the battery cover obviously So here's the battery once again, and then the top it the battery slides pretty nicely into this little slot right there You can't really see it because my camera's not very good. But um, okay. So this is the other part of the iron sight and so you just kind of look through there and then you see what I've already showed you. And it's really nice accuracy. It's really nice fit onto your shoulder, this thing. So it's a really good gun to buy it. Unfortunately, it is quite a bit of money. It's like 200 and something something dollars. Yeah. So here so I guess one sec. Let me just try to slide this thing on I I don't have a very good camera, so I can't try to kind of fix it up so you can watch me do it But it's hard Okay Yeah, it's not gonna work But here just gonna take a second there we go okay, so I slid the iron sight on to top that covered the battery and firm it it won't really wobble too much. It kind of has just just it's sort of a replica right here you can pull this thing back it doesn't really do anything obviously so it's kind of just a cool effect.

It was pretty honest so the grip is really nice hard plastic you can't it's just you have to I don't know if you can see it but there's kind of a screw right here that you have to unscrew take it off the grip the trigger is metal I have no clue what you call this thing but it's really good really nice and firm so it comes with its own battery so you don't have to worry about that it's recyclable battery cycleable. So yeah it takes about 6 hours to charge that up once you get this gun. So here's the mag right here. Okay, the mag is really nice actually. It's a metal mag I think. Oh sorry it's plastic. It feels like metal though. So it has obviously the thing that pulls up your BBs into the mag. So yeah let's look at the gun. So to put the mag in you kind of got to put forward first and then just kind of pull it in Push it in from the back. It's kind of hard. There we go. It's hard to do it with one hand So you pull it in like that. Yeah, the guns decently heavy Okay, it's turned over here Just like all the AK's it has kind of the safe right here full auto semi auto this yeah Obviously sense the battery. Yes an electric gun for us to see that start The iron sights aren't that bad really like it's not the greatest, but it's pretty decent So it has the battery cover obviously So here's the battery once again, and then the top it the battery slides pretty nicely into this little slot right there You can't really see it because my camera's not very good. But um, okay. So this is the other part of the iron sight and so you just kind of look through there and then you see what I've already showed you and It's really nice accuracy. It's really nice fit onto your shoulder this thing So it's a really good gun to buy it. Unfortunately. It is quite a bit of money. It's like 200 and Something something dollars. Yeah So here so I guess one sec let me just try to slide this thing on I I don't have a very good camera, so I can't try to kind of fix it up so you can watch me do it But it's hard Okay Yeah, it's not gonna work But here just gonna take a second there we go, okay, so I slid the iron sight on to top that covered the battery and firm it it won't really wobble too much. It kind of has just just it's sort of a replica right here you can pull this thing back it doesn't really do anything obviously so it's kind of just a cool effect. So yeah so this is my gun I got it for my birthday. Yeah so that's basically it thanks for watching rate comment peace"

Mucho antes, en la Holanda del siglo XVI, el Bosco realizó una serie de creaciones en las que una amalgama de figuras ambientadas en paisajes imaginarios con elementos fantásticos y en ocasiones monstruosos, con figuras híbridas, humanos y animales, habitaban paisajes bucólicos de gran atractivo. Las piezas más famosas que reflejan este estilo son las tentaciones de San Antonio, el carro del Eno y el jardín de las delicias. Frente a este último cuadro me detuvo el largo tiempo al visitar el Prado en Madrid. Olcerbarlo detenidamente es ratificar la idea de ciertos críticos que han dicho que el Bosco pintó cuadros ejemplarizantes aludiendo a los pecados y sus consecuencias. Conceptos filosóficos del mundo basados en dichos populares o creencias de la época. lo logra comunicar a través de símbolos con un lenguaje muy sofisticado y es ese mecanismo a mi juicio el que provoca que su pintura ejerza tanta seducción. Volviendo al cine y su capacidad de reflejar el mundo que no rodea, el cineasta polaco Lesh Majeski lo hace converger con la pintura en una exquisita producción titulada El Molino y la Cruz, la cual se basa en la procesión alcalvario, uno de los cuartos de quien fuera para algunos el más importante pintor holandés del siglo XVI, Peter Bruegel. Inspirado en el estilo del bosco, Bruegel, el viejo, reflejó la vida cotidiana de su tiempo con realismo y con una abundancia de detalles magistrales. Majersky se vale de esta pieza para hacernos entrar al mundo estético del pintor, nos traslada a la época de la brutal ocupación española de Flandes. Recreé a personajes que escapan del lienzo para llegar al cine y esa magia de hacerlo confluir con lo mejor del arte universal. Cuando tuve la suerte de adquirir el filme con una copia pirateada con profesionalismo y una nitidez de original como resultado, tuve deseos de salir corriendo y comentarlo a quien pudiera impresionar. Alguien a quien el cine y la pintura le apasionaran por igual. Aquella noche mi esposa la ansiedad por verlo, evidente y un pacto secreto de no reverar la fuente al regalarle una copia. Estaba feliz en mi humana e infantil vanidad de haber mostrado algo que desconociera hasta el momento el admirado crítico cinematográfico Orlando Alomado. Pero como dice una canción popular, la vida te da sorpresas. Supe que sentí a fascinación además por la pintura de Bruegel el viejo y que había traducido, a qué momento me dijo un poema, un poema de William Carlos de Carlos Victoria me decía que Alomá era su guía para el cine, que fue capaz de celebrar de con aires de complicidad para el convencimiento. No sé si debemos agradecer a esa copia pirateada del Molino y la Cruz, a la magia del cine o a Bruegel el Piejo. Pero el caso es que finalmente esta noche podemos disfrutar de una presentación de Orlando Lomón en la otra esquina de las palabras.","I think that it is going to be a very enjoyable presentation. I'm going to read a work by Orlando Nomaz and Peter Puego, the old man. and later the film by the Lumières brothers was the reflection of the universe that surrounded the man. of his painting, The Fusilamiento of May 3. Much before, in the Netherlands of the 16th century, the forest made a series of creations in which a range of figures set on imaginary landscapes with fantastic elements and on monstrous occasions with hybrid, human and animal figures, inhabited bucolic landscapes of great attraction. The most famous pieces that reflect this style are the temptations of Saint Anton, the car of the eno and the garden of the delights. In front of this last painting, it took me a long time to visit the Prado in Madrid. Observing it carefully is to ratify the idea of ​​certain critiques that have said that the forest painted exemplary paintings alluding to sins and its consequences. Philosophical concepts of the world based on popular sayings or beliefs of the time. He manages to communicate through symbols, with a very sophisticated language, and it is this mechanism, to my judgment, that causes his painting to exert so much seduction. Coming back to cinema and his ability to reflect the world that does not surround, the Polish filmmaker Lesz Majewski makes it converge with painting in a exquisite production titled Molino and La Cruz, which is based on the procession of the Calvary, one of the four of those who were, for some, the most important Dutch painter of the 16th century, Pieter Bruegel. Inspired in the style of the woods, Bruegel, the old man, reflected the daily life of his time with realism and with a abundance of masterful details. Majersky is worth this piece to make us enter the aesthetic world of the painter, our link to the time of the brutal Spanish occupation of Flanders. I was lucky to get the film with a pirated copy with professionalism and a sharpness of originality as a result. I wanted to run out and comment on who I could impress. Someone who in the cinema and painting they were passionate about the same. That night my wife and I went to the cinema to see the film. I would like to present a painting exhibition of Roberto Mora. And there, at the entrance, I see talking to the sea. I have met few people who enjoy talking about cinema as much as him. Paraphrasing to a parliament of one of his favorite films, the Alcon Maltese, I like to talk to those who like to do it on a topic that I end up with. When I talked about the film, the result was the expected. I was very anxious to see it, evident and a secret pact of not revealing the source when giving them a copy. I was happy in my human and infantile vanity of having shown something that I did not know until the moment, the critical cinema look of Orlando Alomar. But as a popular song says, life surprises you. I knew that I felt fascination also by the painting of Bruegel, the old man, and that I had translated, at what time a poem was told to me. William, titled, Carlos Victoria told me that Alomá was his guide for cinema, who was able to celebrate the success of the film. I would like to invite you to have a scene where you can discover that in Spain, Rebecca was called Rebecca, a writer in allusion to one of her favorite movies, Rebecca. By the way, Carlos' favorite too. For some time now, my friend, the poet Joaquín Galvez, had extended an invitation to speak German to present himself in the other corner of the words. Even, until the painter and the cinephile, his friend Chago, had suggested certain with complicated air for the commencement. I don't know if we should thank that pirated copy of Molino y la Cruz to the magic of cinema or Abruégel el Piejo. But the case is that finally tonight we can enjoy a presentation of Orlando Lomán in the other corner of the palace."

We thought it was lost to the well the sands of time I guess you could say Buried somewhere deep within the valve archives, but we are team of experts specifically zoid from valve huge shout out to zoid who does all the server work for them Thank you zoid We love you has been able to dig up game number three of fear versus funnick the 1v1 shadow feet matchup Should be an interesting game from what I've been heard it's a little bit wacky, we'll get into it very quickly. Not going to bother going through the rules in too much detail. This is the deciding game 3, it's a best of 3 format, it was TA vs. Venomancer, the players each tried their hand at each side and well when it was also done, Venomancer prevailed. It seems the Nuva fraction is just a little bit too weak, especially when you're not bottle crowing to be able to handle Venom 1v1. So the good news is, maybe not the fairest matchup, but each player got a shot at each side and now we go to a much fairer, if potentially volatile game number 3. It's going to be 1v1 Shadow Fiend mid. This is the first time we've ever had to do it in a fistful of tangos here at Beyond the Summit. There's no items, there's no runes, and the reason for this is that one of the heroes must be created via cheats because there is no same hero mode in Dota 2. Yet. Note to Valve, please add same hero mode. Thank you very much. But until they add that, this is the best we can do. So to make it fair, the player who's spawning a hero via cheats, the, what technically it's actually considered a bot, although you can't control it, will not, he'll be no items, no runes, and so will the player who's the actual hero, the normal one. So that's how we made the matchup as fair as possible. And in this mode, the first kill or first tower wins. So I've gone over the matchup very quickly. We're in the brackets right now. Winter brackets and we finals. This is game three. The winner moves on to face Cinderan. And I know a lot of you have general questions about scheduling at this tournament. There have been delays. The reason for that is simply just issues scheduling the matches. That's the only reason for the delays. There's no big secret. None of the players have dropped out, but with new years, with the holidays, with people traveling, la-dee-la-dee-la, people on over, whatever. That way you can stay up to date on the tournament. Okay, so we're in the winners bracket. That's enough general information about the tournament. This is game three. It's time for the deciding match. Who's it gonna be? Will it be Funnick? Will it be Fear? We'll find out after this. are spoiling you now. Some of you will know the result of this game already. I did announce it on stream since I thought the suspense might actually kill a man. So the result has already been announced for those of you who heard about it. Try not to spoil in the chat, but it's already probably being spoiled as I say that. So yeah, let's go ahead and just don't read chat if you don't want to be spoiled. With all that being said, this is the deciding game three. Even if you know the outcome, it will be interesting to see how the particular game turns out. Remember, these players have to spawn their heroes via cheats. It looks like they There's two Shadow fiends having some issues actually creating the heroes with cheats properly, but hopefully they'll get it sorted out soon Apparently you have to rebind your hotkeys. So a couple technical difficulties obviously Same hero mode would be a little bit simpler, but this one is relatively entertaining and well, let's see How's this matchup gonna shake out? There's no items. There's no runes and what we look at it shadow fiend is 38 based damage at level 1 You always see players get a lot of plus stats you often sometimes you'll see them trying to rush your bottle But even then you at least a couple of branches and maybe a slippers as well. You can't really go for a full eco build, but with no stats, Last Hitting is going to be extremely difficult. And you might be thinking, oh, I'll just raise to Last Hit, but here's the problem. No runes, no items. So you really have to conserve that monopool. You don't want to be spamming level and raises just to get one or two souls and then find yourself unable to fight because they've got the raises and they use them on you. So mana and HP are two of your most precious resources, potentially even more important than Last Hits with because you can't use the gold so the only point to getting the last hits is to build up your souls which is still an important factor but certainly not the only one it looks like the un pauses here no point in checking the runes because we've said no runes allowed so you see the players not even going to not even going to them the bunch of items were purchased then I think whoever was on this side and speaking of which who is on each side let's introduce that now so we have fear or ya roby from DC fan ya roby the the the real king of 1v1 mid but he's retired he's moved on to greener pastures So fear of Evil Genius is gonna be on the radiant side for this matchup. And then we have Funnick on the dire side. Fear versus Funnick, who's gonna win? Somebody whose name starts with the capital F. That much I can tell you. And of course in this 1v1 mid, the early creep blocky is gonna be very, very important. And it looks like Funnick actually gets the better block and I just realized now, I don't have in-game audio. So let's get some in-game audio. There we go. Didn't really miss too much action as far as that goes. Already Funnick getting a slight edge when it comes to the auto attack harassment. Every little auto attack, remember you do have your base regen, but it's very low in Shadowfiend, only 1 HP per second. So any auto attack you take is gonna take at least 30 plus seconds, well maybe a little bit less after armor reduction. It's gonna take a while to regen that back up, that's the point. And so getting those last hits, yes important, but you don't wanna do it at too much of a cost. Remember this matchup is extremely volatile, the first kill or the first tower wins. And I have a feeling it's gonna come down to the first kill without having bottle or items. As we see the first rays coming out, pretty difficult to actually count on this going long enough to get a tower because if you have to go back to base you've almost all but lost the matchup I would say in most cases since when you come back they're gonna be way ahead in levels and souls and well when it comes to souls dead even so far it doesn't matter if you get denies or last hits they're all the same in this matchup and for both players it seems like so far the last thing is pretty even the radiant shadow being slightly ahead we see plus six souls already for him and plus five for funnix so fear slightly ahead does have the better defense upon But Kenny actually do it fear throws the raise and the auto attack fear pulls a fast one on funic Funic went for it. He said screw it. I'm falling behind on CS I don't want this to turn into a last-hitting war and I'm just gonna go for the win Unfortunately, well he went for the win, but what he got was a loss So that's brings us back to the playoff brackets now fear is gonna be advancing He'll be facing cindering in the winners bracket finals whoever wins that match is one Best out of five away from winning the tournament so that should be a real exciting treat Remember, first place is getting a pretty hefty prize pool. I think it's an additional $200. It might be $250. We haven't decided exactly how we're going to distribute the extra prize winnings. But for this particular match, Funnick, or Fearrather, is going to take home $40. Funnick on the other side, he drops down. He'll be facing the loser or the winner of Sing Sing vs. Merlene down there in the loser's bracket. So he's got a tougher road to the finals. He's going to have to win one, two, at least two extra matches compared to whoever wins Cinder and vs. Fearr. So it's a tougher road. for error he can lose one game per series but he's got to win the series that wraps it up for funic versus fear we'll have more action coming up soon most likely the g-league awaits but possibly more fistful of tango's action thanks for tuning in guys stay tuned more great dota coming your way soon and it's all here on beyond the summit","Ladies and gentlemen, it is here the long awaited We thought we couldn't excavate it.

I can tell you guys that much But this is one of the very few games I played on regular Dom, and I think I played by myself. I'm not too sure but I'm gonna tell you guys one specific stats. I'm gonna tell you guys one stat, okay? And hopefully you guys don't get disappointed, but I died six times out of the whole game. Okay, six times. That's it. Not in the future, not in the friggin' midway in the video, and the whole friggin' game. Okay, so stick that in your mind and watch the video. Watch my, hear my voice, not watch my voice. Hear my voice. and hopefully you guys enjoy well as you guys can see I'm running around with the PDW one of my favorite all-time weapons for black ops 2 and it has a very large magazine just to start off with and my kill streaks or my score streaks excuse me my score streaks are care package health storm and lightning strike I should have been like this guy freaking going with dogs and swarm but let's just say I beat him too I'm not that good of a player to go around and start killing people. I love being here, but you know every player that I play with mostly is from the mainland and don't get me wrong Hawaii don't get me wrong if you anybody Hawaii bottles and sisters watching this video don't get me wrong you guys are some hardcore mmm but I play mostly with the mainland the state guys and They're awesome, you know, it's awesome playing with these guys because there's mostly kids kids that you know that you know they can't beat me but you know when I play Hawaii kids they can beat me I don't know I don't know why but it's been such a up and down feeling for me playing this game because I don't like playing by myself I get kind of bored playing by myself that's why I need like a storyline or something but if I'm not doing good then I'm like hi you know I freaked this game you know I hate this game already but But that's how it is, you know, I'm guessing that's how it is with a lot of people, you know playing this game When you playing by yourself, you don't get all the excitement that you know that you get when you're playing with teammates or when you're playing with fellow friends and stuff like that But all I know is that when when I play this game I get bored fast So I need to play with a friend, but this is one of the very very few games look I died I killed myself for the frigging lightning strike This is one of the very few games where I actually did good by myself and I'm pretty proud of it. I pat myself in the back. I was like holy crap, you know, I did really well, surprisingly well. Hopefully as well as you guys like it, you know, because I'm looking me. I'm running around trying to get flags. I'm playing the objective, you know, I'm not spawn camping. I'm not camping, period. So I know I've been playing this game so much times where people Just camp even on domination play the objective people play the objective This is what domination is for this is how you win now I can tell if you guys can't or if you guys can't or won't win I don't know But there's yeah, look at another multi kill freaking multi kill I think that this is my second or third multi kill the game I think I have maybe a lot four or five freaking quad feed so Sometimes these care packages. This is a long I don't know if you guys know this but this is a game from a very long time and I never really used the carry package in a while so I know this is a pretty long time video so carry packages in my understanding is a little I don't know it's hard to say because it's kind of like you know you get good stuff sometimes not all the time not even most of the time You get good stuff maybe sometimes and that turns out to be sometimes frustrating because every time I take out the current package I get freaking UAVs or counter UAVs. That's irritating. I don't like that. I want all the good stuff like swarm and and uh freaking stealth chopper and and stealth bomber AC 130 Osprey gunner Look at that making some of those uh model warfare 3 references. Hey, hey, hey well um Well, this is one of those games where I do take out the carry package. I'm running around killing people It's it's just been that game that good, you know, like I rarely have that I rarely have that opportunity where I can just run around and start killing people But let's just say that I play a lot better surprisingly on Hardcore domination. Yeah, I'm racking those 50, 60 kills every game and that's when I'm trying hard. Now sometimes I don't like to try hard because everybody's like, well you gotta be able to try hard. So I usually bust out some of these good weapons that I'm not too familiar with and start using them instead. But when they start pissing me off, then I bust out the M-Tar or I'll bust out the Peacekeeper, my Diamond Peacekeeper.

Many people who have completed the basic needs and are interested in the community because they work in this way, they want to be in a new environment that may affect their interests and they have to be put under a situation from now on. So they prefer to stay in this situation, which is in front of their people, Also, this difference is caused by the contact with the person, the lack of critical thinking. Only the contents of the environment, which can be completely healthy, can be recognized. And because of this lack of critical thinking, of the child, I cannot say that there are things beyond the dimension, beyond the contents of the environment, which are problematic, or a little bit of humane, and people who have a phase or are in the middle of the Danes who face problems of the other and are known to them."

Y bueno para empezar, mi primera impresión sobre este juego fueron muy buenas, la verdad que me sorprendió bastante, sobre todo muy historia que es lo que más he jugado. Están muy muy bien, muy muy currado, la verdad tanto por lo gráfico como la jugabilidad como el realismo, la verdad que es muy muy bien. Los gráficos son muy buenos, no lo podes observar muy bien con mi capturadora porque no viene a ser HD pero si tenéis la oportunidad de ver algún vídeo en HD y si no tenéis huevo, si tenéis la posibilidad de ver algún vídeo en HD os lo recomiendo porque los gráficos son muy buenos. El realismo también, el modo este que hay que para el tiempo con la bala, la verdad que es muy muy bueno, está muy currado. y la jugabilidad también muy buena, el muñeco, osea Max en este caso se mueve, lo puede manejar muy bien la verdad que tiene muy buenos movimientos y eso me gusta bastante que el muñeco pueda moverse, esquivar las balas hay como veis, ruedas sobre suelo, cubrirse en los parapetos la verdad muy completo este juego aunque lo que más me gusta en este juego son los discparencias como ya sabéis es un género shooter, de disparo, shooter acción, shooter y acción, está muy muy bien argumentado, la verdad que es modo historia para mí lo mejor, porque el multijugador viene a ser como un multijugador de red de también que son muy parecidos todos los multijugadores de rockstar y aunque eso no quiere decir que no sean completos y aquí veis el bullet time que es lo que acaban de implementar en este juego aunque no sé si en la entrega anterior de Max Payne estaba pero la verdad que me ha sorprendido bastante está muy muy currado ese ese complemento que lo han puesto a este juego y ahí como veis lo gráfico realismo puro y duro las conversaciones con las las conversaciones aquí como veis ahora con los con los demás ciudadanos de la favela y todo la verdad que muy bien no me gustaría hacer spoiler por si os lo queréis comprar o algo no me gustaría hacer spoiler pero la verdad que la historia está muy bien muy bien argumentada muy bien muy bien conseguida y bueno la verdad 100% recomendable para la gente perdón que para la gente que le guste los genres shurrers como he dicho y acción ahora también está un precio muy muy bueno la verdad lo podría aprovechar está creo a 40 a 40 euros en en GameGate.com y en no sé si en más tiendas pero la verdad está muy buen precio para el juego que es un juego gato la verdad por mi opinión mi opinión es que es un juego gato y es multijuador, es multijuador muy completo no lo he jugado mucho la verdad es muy completo le puedes equipar a tus soldados con cacos ya sea en el salto de antivala un montón de opciones la verdad le puedes poner ventaja Si lo copo no, pero su menta es diferente pero está bastante bien. También puedes elegir tu personaje, o sea no determinas un personaje para el modo online y toda la parte que juegue es con un personaje igual. Puede elegir el personaje que tú quieras, o sea hay un montón de personajes para elegirlo y tú puedes coger que tú quieras para cada partida. Y la verdad muy bien, muy contento y nada. Espero que os haya gustado este pequeño análisis y opinión. mi propia y nada nos vemos en el siguiente vídeo, hasta luego","Hey guys, today I'm going to give you my personal opinion about this game called Max Pain 3. To begin with, my first impressions about this game were very good. I was really surprised, especially the monitor, which is what I've played the most. It's very well done, very well done. The truth is both the graphics, the gameplay and realism. Graphics are very good, I can't really use them with my capture because they don't have HD, but if you have the chance to watch some HD video and if you don't have the game, if you have the chance to watch some HD video I recommend it because the graphics are very good. Realism too, the mode that there is that stops time with the bullet, the truth is that it is very very good, it is very well done. The playability is also very good, the Mooneco, Max in this case moves very well, it has very good movement and I like that Mooneco can move, dodge bullets, there is a way, I roll over the ground, I cover the parapets, the truth is very complete this game, although what I like the most in this game are the discards, As you can see in the shooter, it is very well documented, the real story mode is the best for me, because the multiplayer is also very similar to the rogstar multiplayer, although that does not mean that they are not complete, and here you see the pull-time, which is what they have just implemented I would not like to do spoilers but the story is very well documented and very well achieved and well, 100% recommended for people who like the genre shurers as I said and action now it is also a very good price, I could take advantage of it, I think it is 40 euros in I don't know if it's in more stores, but it's a good price for the game, for my opinion. It's a multiplayer game, not a lot of games. You can equip your soldier with cacti, anti-ball, a lot of options, you can put a lot of advantage. You can choose your character, you can choose the character you want, you can choose the character you want, and you can choose the character you want for each game. See you in the next video, bye!"

Sometimes I wonder whether you hide or not. I think you got this one. It's going to be a 3 to 0 for them. If you want to rematch I'll do it because they ain't going to win. If I do it and if they just lost to them there ain't no way they're going to win. But that's a 3 to 0 thing against Hud mafia. If there's going to be enough of a race I'll post it up. If they're going to give up then I'll put it on the website. Thanks for watching."

He is the king of glory. Salah. Maybe seated in the house of God. Amen. If I would title this text it would be titled Just to See Him. Just to See Him. Some sing Just to See Him. Just to See Him. to look upon his face. Just the Bible records in Psalms 37 that the steps of a good man are ordered, meaning they are logically arranged by the Lord. And he delighted in his way. But please notice that David said a good man. Now Jesus has something to say about a good man in Matthew 12 and 35. He said these words. He said, a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. And the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. Listen, saints of God, what the Bible is trying to say and what Jesus is trying to get across to us is that a good man who has a good heart will bring forth good things. Is that all right? And the evil man who has a evil heart will Bring forth evil thing My question to you today is that we've all gathered here in the house of God and the question is what did you? What did you bring? You say I've come to bring good thing. See when you met me this morning I had a smile upon my face I had a hug for you I had some encouraging words for you because guess what what was operating on the inside was good and when I extended it to you Was even better so the question is what did you bring? Now listen, if you've been washed in the blood of the lamb and your name has been written in the lamb's book of life, I'm ready to tell you that you have a good treasure on the inside of you that God has made a deposit into your life. Not because you have been so good, but because he has been so good to you. Can you hear that, your neighbor said, neighbor? He gave it to me, even though I didn't deserve it. What are you talking about, You know how it was when you was young. Amen. You was the baddest rat school in the neighborhood. But what you did was before Christmas came, you would clean up your actor a little bit. You would make your bed, take out the garbage, do all kind of stuff because you knew you wanted something for Christmas. And even though, come on, some of us, how many been here, you didn't deserve a thing. When you woke up on Christmas morning, you had a whole bunch of gifts under the tree. And after you got your gifts, what gets what you did? You went right back to the same way you was before. Amen. You didn't deserve it, but your parents seem fit to give it to you anyhow. See that's how good God is. God is a God who is able that even though I don't deserve to be blessed, even though I don't deserve the good things from God, He is a God who is able to look beyond my faults and see right to my need. That's the goodness of God. He knows exactly what I need. Listen Saints of God, the Bible says for God commanded the light to shine out of darkness. How many here have had to endure some dark situations in your life? If you can't testify to that, just live a little longer and you'll be able to testify that you had to endure some dark situations in your life. But I told you earlier that the steps of a good man is ordered by God. So no matter how dark your situation might be, all you need to do is hold the God's unchanging hand in God and His This on timing will command the light to shine in your darkness. How many can testify that God has commanded some light to shine in your dark situation? You see all this hands should have went up because guess what? You were born in darkness. For the Bible says you were born in sin and shapened in iniquity. How many know that you didn't have to go to school to learn how to sin? I'll take a sin 101 you know how to sin from an early age? Do you ever see little kids sitting around and they're just so innocent? They're young like Leah got her baby there what eight weeks old nine weeks old whatever the case may be that baby is innocent wouldn't hurt anybody. Amen all once is love. Amen, but that same baby look at two and three years old can be sitting in a pill with a bunch of other kids and if there's one toy but three kids two kids is in trouble. We didn't have to learn how to sin. We were born in it. We were born in a dark situation, but God stopped by to see about us, because he wouldn't leave us in that state of mind. The command of the light to shine out of the darkness and the darkness that have shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. So since Jesus has given me a little light and told me to let it shine, not so the world can see me. me, but that the world can see the Jesus in me. The goodness is that God is not dead, but he is still alive because early Sunday morning, he rose with all power of heaven and earth in his hands. Let me tell you, Sister Johnson, it ain't because I'm the pastor of Mount Air Baptist Church that I feel like going on. It ain't because I know a few hymns in the hymn book that I feel like going on. I know this life that I'm living is worth the living just because my God lives. Amen. Because he lives, I got up this morning. Because he lives here, I was willing to go to the house of God because he lives. I got praise on the inside because he lives. I know that everything's going to be all right because he lives. I know he got the whole world in his head because he lives. I can face tomorrow just because he lives. Listen, we've gathered here today to lift up the name of Jesus, but the tragedy is that you look if you look to your left and to your right, there's still some folks that can't see it. They can't see the goodness of God operating in their lives. They can't see and understand that they didn't get this far all by themselves. But it was God who had brought them. You see, let me tell you something. I could have been dead and resting in my grave. But the Lord seemed fit to make my enemies behave. But guess what? Some folks, they just, just can't see them. And the hospital sick and you couldn't get well. You put your trust in the doctors, but they stood up perplexed and confused about your situation, but he came by and touched you, but you just can't see him. Even the disciples that walked with him and had him and with their own eyes, amen. Of course the time of the disciples were getting into the ship to depart to the other side and they forgotten to take bread and all they had on the ship was just one loaf, all them disciples in one loaf of bread. This and Jesus had to teach them to walk by faith and not you","The operation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Lift up your heads, O Ye gates.

It's something that is increasing a lot, right? People are taking care of themselves more lately. Although some people don't have time to practice physical activities, don't eat properly, the trend is increasing a lot for this market. Marcos, what advice could you as a personal trainer give us here so that we can improve our quality and even be more And what is your playlist? Of course, it's essential. We have healthy habits, a good diet and practice these physical exercises regularly, from two to three times a week at least. And you also said that a good diet, what would we be? Do we alternate some foods? It's very important to avoid excess of alcohol-based consumption, very caloric foods, more salty, hard to eat, especially in this heat, right? The fruit fans can use and abuse now. For sure. The health organization recommends at least five types of fruit per day. We know that it is very difficult, in the daily, stress, work career. It is very difficult for someone to consume two or three fruits, right? That's why it is a very important tip for all of you, which I recommend to all of my students, which is a premium drink called Monavi. It is a juice, a premium drink of 19 fruits with collagen and Ana Maria Braga is a consumer, she's from the US, she's from Brazil, she indicates to people that she wants to have more health and quality of life and doesn't have much time to have a good diet. And this drink, is it alcoholic or is it a completely healthy drink? It's a completely healthy drink. This one, right? It looks like a wine, but it's very cool. Very cool. And I keep asking myself, how can you I present myself every day and make you much happier. So, from today, ask yourself, how can I change my story and be a complete person with emotional, mental and professional balance? Follow the tips and be very happy. Next week we will be together here in the New World Quad. See you there!"

Yeah in a week. Yeah. And it was in 10 years ago in 1999 you toured with Paris Lost in Scandinavia. Yeah, 10 years ago. And they're one host. It's interesting how things are. We were here, in this place actually. With Paris Lost? Yeah. Paris Lost had changed a lot in that time. You guys, I think it's been more of a steady evolution. I think the only point where things got maybe a bit confusing for some people was Discouragements when you introduce clean vocals. Do you think that move if it hadn't happened then it would have happened at some point I imagine it would because you know didn't do that the vocals Yeah, yeah, yeah, was it that you could say it's a combination of both wanting to go further progress Yeah, and also having Jonas inability to to gravel and it was it was more like was it that he didn't want to or just physically couldn't I think in the beginning it was the physical problem, you know He couldn't do it, but then once he discovered his clean vocal talent he felt that's the way to go. It was a good move, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. Imagine him still struggling with his screams from the Dance of December Souls. What does the Silam play Brave Life? We do. We actually used to play it without God as well. You're not playing that tonight are you? Maybe. We have a very short stage time though. It's like one minute over that and we're out of the tour, you know, yeah, so that they open the trap towards the stage You mentioned earlier that you wrote this album We're basically doing night you made it when once you got really started it flow started to flow but How did this is I mean you're an artist you write songs when you when you're done with one song How do you begin the next one? It's more about asking about the process That's an interesting question. I don't think I do write a song entirely finished and then start with a new one. I leave them unfinished, all of them to a certain state and then I finish them all. That's what I do, I think. Because I don't think a song is entirely finished until after we leave the studio. A lot of the songs are completed in the studio as well. I leave a lot of stuff open in there. Not drum-wise. That's solid. That's all made, you know. We like me and Jonas main songwriters we you know programmed the drums with a What do you say? Drowned computer, but you know what I mean the software or whatever like that But as far as the music them vocals everything that will leave very open a lot of you know if you if I would compare the demos on this album To to the album here it would not sound the same, you know that would be different. So it's not just them They changed tactical things actually changed that like You have a studio time and all that pressure that goes around. But that's the challenge as well. You work best on the pressure. People often do that. We do. It's like it has worked every time so far. The only thing that didn't work was the finding the motivation to get the songwriting going for this one. That's our only problem so far. But like the Brain Murder Day album, we wrote the entire album in the studio. So you have a certain talent. I wouldn't call it talent, it's luck. I think it'd be the both. the ultimate song. You know what I mean? That's the kind of... Once that song ends, you just want to feel like where do they go from here? What can they go from here? What can they do now? Is that kind of like a standout song for you? It's not a standout song. Definitely not. I would say for me it's the most special song on the album. It's not a favorite song on the album, you know what I mean? But it's the most special song on the album. The song is the first one that I kind of latch onto because it's quite beautiful. The song turned out so well. Is it an indicator for the future? The whole album is an indication of the future. This is quite different though. Yeah, but that's where we want to go right now. I think the Catatoules right now, we can go a little bit where we want. We have a 360 degree option. We were confident enough to know that we could make that album. Beautiful track. To me it's the most beautiful dark song I've heard since one year from now. I really love one year from now. To close up the album with such a heavy track. It's heavy in the atmosphere and the emotion. When I'm done with the album, the album is flow thing. It has its ups and downs. And then you come with that track which really pushes me down, down, down and then down. When I'm done with it with the album it's like okay should I play it again or should I just Go and meet some people who can join me up again because I get it's not depressed, but I get really bad from it in a dark way I don't know if I love the song or if I love hate the song I love what you're saying. Yeah, you know what I mean? It's this is the thing we talked about this exact reaction is what we wanted to have with that song exactly that reaction because we always said What is after the song is ended and we said that's the void, you know, that's the void. What will people do after? It's a good idea to put the last song in. Yeah, where else could it be? You know, it's like Jesus Christ. It's so stupid with those albums that are blasting for 40 minutes and the last minute is acoustic. It's like, okay. I don't know that band. I hate to turn up, even though I love the last album. But I did that actually. I didn't understand it, but I love the album anyway. I want to ask about touring. I read that you plan to do European tour and also American. European headlining or are you looking which way? Both, both headlining. You toured the state, you toured with Moonspell, right? Yeah, the last time, yeah. No, that was tour with Scars symmetry the last time. Okay, yeah. Moonspell before. Okay, and how were those tours? Great! I read a review of, I think it was the New York show, I'm not sure, of Moonspell. And the review kind of more or less said that Moonspell were headlining, but you were the headliners. And that when you played it was, I'm not sure whether it said people left or the atmosphere kind of died or whatever, but did you feel that when you did that tour that there was a lot of people waiting a long time? Yeah, I mean honestly, I mean that's why we came back so soon after on the next tour. We were touring already within the same year, you know, again. So the promoters just said, whoa, you should the headline, you know what I mean? they turned it around. But that was a nice tour. Moonspell guys, great. We know them for a long time. But I think when they took us out, they didn't expect us to turn the tables, so to speak. Because that was our first tour in America. And it made all the people that's been waiting for us ever since we released them or whatever. They came out to see us for the first time. Did you see a lot of old school people? I did. Yeah. The old logo? Yeah. Great.","After this you go to the UK with Paris Lost. Yeah, in a week. Yeah. And it was in 10 years ago in 1999 you toured with Paris Lost in Scandinavia. Yeah, 10 years ago.

They're learning about the food science. and then slowly will merge them into the restaurant. But what kind of kid is going to want to work in the restaurant? Well, there's a certain type of kid that succeeds there and it's, you know, we've got our college prep kids who are very focused on college prep courses and they do great and off they go.

And the kinds of ideas that they come up with, the unique solutions that they have for this planet are just the things that we need in this world to be sustainable. And their voice needs to be heard. and if they're given the opportunity and they're given some structure around it, there's nothing these kids can't do. And then the unique part is that we provide funding at the end where they can then use it for continuing education. Restaurants happen to be a dynamic place to learn skill sets. You've got different languages, you've got different cultures in restaurants, and it's just fun. It's exciting, it's fast-paced. And when you hit it, it's just the same as, you know, the sweet spot on a soccer ball. That's my best analogy. When you hit it, it's perfect. It's music. It's harmony.

And so we're giving them jobs, we're giving them skill sets, we're giving them opportunities and funding to go on to college, but we're also giving them a culture that they belong to. And what they're adding to that is what's going to make it so exciting. They've got their wings, they're ready to soar, and the world is theirs. And the kinds of ideas that they come up with, the unique solutions that they have for this planet are just the things that we need in this world to be sustainable. And their voice needs to be heard. And if they're given the opportunity and they're given some structure around it, there's nothing these kids can't do. And then the unique part is that we provide funding at the end where they can then use it for continuing education. Restaurants happen to be a dynamic place to learn skill sets. You've got different languages, you've got different cultures in restaurants, and it's just fun. It's exciting at a fast pace. And when you hit it, it's just the same as, you know, the sweet spot on a soccer ball. That's my best analogy. When you hit it, it's perfect. It's music. It's harmony. And at the end of the night, everyone in the restaurant sits down. They have a meal together. They talk about it. It's like winning a game. It's really fun."

And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desire to of him. If any man see his brother sin a sin, which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is born of God, sineth not, but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himself, and that wicked one touches him not. And we know that we are of God, and the whole In chapter 5 here I'd like to concentrate on just basically two things, verses 7 and 8 and then the couple that are on further. It makes a point here, for there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, which is another way of saying Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. Some people do... I've never run across anybody that really understood the concept of the Trinity, but that was developed by lawyers and philosophers about 300 years after Christ was crucified. They had a problem in that time. There was a philosophy that was circulating that basically said that, or that prompted them to field that they needed to handle this. And the philosophy was that anything that was of earth was morally corrupt. And then somebody asked, well, didn't Christ have an earthly body? And didn't He come from the earth? And didn't that make Him sort of morally corrupt somehow? And they couldn't allow that. So then they had to come up with some kind of idea that He didn't really have an earthly body, which was kind of dumb, because then if He didn't really have an earthly body, then what happened when He was crucified? Where did they drive the spikes through? Right? Was there any pain? Well, if you didn't have an earthly body, was there any pain? Probably not. Was there any blood? Well, maybe not. It was just made to look like it. It, it, it leaves all kinds of really strange questions up there, but, you know, they, they needed to have something and that's what they came up with. To me, it doesn't seem any more difficult than if you have a president of a company and two vice presidents. And, you know, they're the upper management of the company. They sit down together. They make decisions. assignments made and the president makes the decision, signs some executive orders and the vice presidents go carried out. And nobody would think that they're the same person. They're just the upper management and Heavenly Father and the Savior and the Holy Ghost are the upper management of Heavenly Father's Kingdom. It sort of makes more sense to me than any trying to think of any sort of like being three different versions of the same thing. But Paul and John are has a really nice indication here of something that's really nice and it can be taken a lot of different ways but I like this one. your hope, your desires for a communion with Heavenly Father through Jesus helps you to purify yourself. And then the water, the baptism, that you're baptized by water, that is symbolic of the cleansing and the burial of the old man down into the water and coming up fresh, just like a resurrection actually from the water, that's what it's symbolic of. And the blood that the Savior shed for you for you as a way of being what we called earlier in the other chapter, the appropriation, the way that you became, how shall we say, accommodated the bridge between you across that gulf which was caused by, caused death to get back together again with Heavenly Father. And of course there's another set of circumstances here too and that is birth. Before birth, the baby is alive, and some of our children were kicking really hard too. But when the water, when my wife's water broke, and the blood was there, the baby came out, all of a sudden there was a whole different spirit in that baby than there had been before, when as soon as it was breathing, boy, it was a whole different than before when it was inside. There's a lot of symbolism in a lot of these things. And John's just, sort of using what's available to him to help people understand that there is symbolism in a lot of things that people don't think there's symbolism in and that Heavenly Father has set it up this way so that we can learn from various aspects of life that he's thought about all of this before he understands. Now, oops, I'm a little further there I wanted to. And verse 14 and 15, and this is the confidence that we have in him. This is the confidence that John is saying, He has in him that the other apostles in him and that we can have in the Savior, that if we ask anything according to his will for us, whatever is good for us, Heavenly Father the Lord will hear us. And if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desire to him, that if they're good for us, he will grant them unto us. What an exciting thing to have. Somebody will actually pay attention to the requests you make. In verse 21, keep yourselves from idols. After remember, idols doesn't mean necessarily those little things that they worship. It can be a job, it can be a car, it can be a house, it can be TV, it can be sports, it can be hobbies. We can worship all of those because anything that we're prepared to give our time to, above giving time to things of the Gospel basically qualifies as an idol I think.","Chapter 5 overcome 1.

À leur arrivée, les habitants d'Azara, à l'est de Homs, tout près de la frontière libanaises, laissent éclater leur désespoir. 50 personnes auraient été enlevées ou arrêtées par l'armée. Les sages-unis turcomments savent que les observateurs ont peu de marge de manœuvre pour l'instant. Peu importe, l'essentiel est d'être entendu. Les slogans d'abord qui demandent la chute du régime, puis, ils montrent les doules de Budochar et de Mortier. Au moins 12 habitants du village auraient été tués et cette femme a perdu ses deux enfants. Azara est tenue par l'armée syrienne libre, reformée de déserteurs que les régimes qualifient de terroristes. Il n'y a pas de groupes armés. Il n'y a que l'armée libre. On est tous de l'armée libre. Je suis déserté de l'armée le 26 mars et j'ai vu les massacres de Babama. Trois pièces d'artilleries les bombardés. Selon les habitants, d'autres déserteurs tentent toujours de rejoindre les rangs de l'armée libre, comme ceux qui conduisaient ce char. Ils ont fait d'éfections et ils ont rejoint l'armée libre chez nous. L'armée les a visés avec un obus, les deux soldats sont morts, l'un était Dalep, l'autre le déresort. En repartant, les observateurs s'arrêtent dans un amour un peu plus bas pour écouter les habitants à l'aubergement. la communauté de Bachar al-Assad. Eux aussi veulent être entendus, eux aussi disent être agressés par les opposants au régime qu'ils qualifient de bandes armées. Regardons nationalité, si tu trouves un seul Syrien parmi eux, c'est un voyou qui sort de prison. Ici, on est tous des soldats d'Assad, on est tous avec Assad, on l'aime tous. Si tous les observateurs repartis, les barrages de l'armée se referment sur Aszara et ses habitants terrifiés.","They were waiting, as if waiting for a saviour, but the UN observers are there to listen to them at least for the first time. Then the inhabitants of Azara, in the east of Homs, near the Lebanese border, let their despair burst. 50 people would have been taken or arrested by the army. My brother is a doctor, his name is Hanimoramed Kanan. They arrested him at Baba Ammar two months ago. We don't know where he is, the intelligence services don't want to tell us anything. The inhabitants of the city are all disappointed. The U.S. and the U.S. know that the observers can walk around for the moment. However, the essential thing is to be heard. The slogans first, which ask for the fall of the regime, then they show the 12 dead and the dead. At least 12 inhabitants of the village would have been killed and this woman lost her two children. Azara is held by the free Syrian army, formed of deserts that the regime qualifies as terrorists. There is no armed group, there is only the free army. We are all free. I was the witness of the Babama massacre. I deserted the army on March 26th and I saw the Babama massacre. Three pieces of artillery, the bombardments. According to the inhabitants, other deserters always try to join the ranks of the free army, like those who led this char. They have made defections and they joined the free army at home. The army warned them with a gun, the two soldiers died, one was Dalep, the other was Der Esor. By leaving, the observers stop in a hameau, a little lower, to listen to the inhabitants of the the Bachaara community in Assad. They also want to be heard, they also want to be attacked by the opponents of the regime that qualifies as a band of armies. Look at our nationality, if you find a Syrian among them, it's a seeker who comes out of prison. Here, we are all Assad's soldiers, we are all with Assad, we love all of them. If all the observers leave, the barracks of the army close themselves on Aszara and its terrified inhabitants."

No question that I'm standing here today in no little part getting to be a little bit of what the Dallas Cowboys and Football and National ball league is about. Because of a young guy when I was 18 years old, looking at him, watching him carefully choose his words, talking to us as a team and educating us. I watched him as he organized an entire state and create funds for a program that didn't have national prominence. I watched him not only coach 19 seasons and only lose four ball games in the month of November, only four in season as he coached the University of Arkansas. Those are the kinds of things, the way his frugalness, the way he basically was resourceful. He called it a big front door and a small back door. Take a lot in and let a little out. That's how Coach Frank Brawls ran the University of Arkansas Athletic Program. So tonight I want to join literally and represent thousands of fans, hundreds and hundreds of ball players, and if you will, several hundred football coaches that passed through his staff in recognizing Frank Brawls and his contribution to college football. Coach, come on up. Coach, it's a tremendous honor for me because you've always been a role model for me in all the years I've coached football. Thank you so very much for being with us tonight. Well, I've been blessed in so many ways. I've had a charm life. I had the only job I ever wanted for today. 50 years ago I went to Arkansas as the head coach. coach. I was a backfield coach as a player, my head coach as assistant coach, and he taught me all the things that are really valuable about being a football coach, Lee. He taught me about integrity. He taught me about graduation for the players. He taught me about treating every player as if he's your own son. I'm grateful to him. And another thing he taught me, don't leave the school you like. He stayed at Georgia Tech as assistant coach, head coach, athletic director, and retired. and that's what I'm trying to do. Sounds like you. Yes, exactly. You know, you've had some wonderful players play for you like Jerry Jones, Barry Switzer, Jimmy Johnson. These guys have been successful in their career. Tell us a little bit about the emotion you feel inside when you see these guys who've had successful careers. I watch the cowboy and get just as nervous as I do watching the Razorbacks play. And certainly when Barry and Jimmy were coaching and Barry won what three national championships and a Super Bowl I was sweating. I pulled for them for the Razorbacks. We are family. That's what we would like to be. You know, you've been involved now as a leader in athletics, college athletics for 61 years. Now you got some free time. Tell me about your new passion. Well, my passion is also to find a cure and to help the caregivers of all times. My wife had it. We went through the trial and error of being a caregiver for her while she was in the hospital. She was sick about five or six years and I saw the need for education. So we've developed the playbook. We've given out an all-timers Caregivers playbook Lee. We've given out a hundred thousand in Arkansas. We're giving out a half a million out and they're all free We're giving out a half million all over the United States. It's being translated in the Spanish in Italian and the Indian nation there We're gonna have it. If we don't find a cure quickly We're gonna have it in every country in the world. It's a wonderful little practical tips guide that helps you take care of your loved one to keep her calm and keep your life. How do we get one of those through the Alzheimer's Association? Alzheimer's Association and then it's on the web also Alzheimer's playbook.com. But every chapter in America of Alzheimer's has books for everybody and they're free. We won't charge a penny for it. Coach, no one's ever won this award. It deserves it more than you. Thank you, Lee. You're a great friend. Thank you. Thank you again. Bless you. Best of luck to your new class. Jerry, thank you so much for coming. Coach, there's one more message here. We've got a famous Arkans and wants to sail over via videotape. Good evening. I'm very sorry I couldn't be with you in person tonight to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my longtime friend and University of Arkansas coaching legend Frank Broils. Coach Broils is known far and wide for his coaching ability and his outstanding record, his unwavering commitment to excellence, and his stewardship of student athletes on and off the field. It is the intangibles that make Coach Broil the kind of man he is. His career was based on his love of and his dedication to the game, his belief in service to his native state and to the people under his charge, and his commitment to creating well-rounded student athletes. I thank you for allowing me to express my appreciation to this great man. I congratulate all the recipients and nominees this evening and I want to say a special word of Thanks to Frank for a lifetime of friendship and for his continuing service and his devotion to solving the riddle, the puzzle and the pain of Alzheimer's.

I watched him as he organized an entire state and create funds for a program that didn't have national prominence. I watched him not only coach 19 seasons and only lose four ball games in the month of November, only four in season as he coached University of Arkansas. Those are the kinds of things, the way his frugalness, the way he basically was resourceful. He called it a big front door and a small back door. Take a lot in and let a little out. That's how Coach Frank Brawls ran the University of Arkansas Athletic Program. So tonight I want to join literally and represent thousands of fans, hundreds and hundreds of ball players, and if you will, several hundred football coaches that passed through his staff in recognizing Frank Brawls and his contribution to college football. Coach, come on up. Coach, it's a tremendous honor for me because you've always been a role model for me in all the years I've coached football. Thank you so very much for being with us tonight. Well, I've been blessed in so many ways. I've had a charm life. I had the only job I ever wanted for today. Fifty years ago, I went to Arkansas as the head coach. coach. I was a backfield coach as a player, my head coach as assistant coach, and he taught me all the things that are really valuable about being a football coach, Lee. He taught me about integrity. He taught me about graduation for the players. He taught me about treating every player as if he's your own son. I'm grateful to him. And another thing he taught me, don't leave the school you like. He stayed at Georgia Tech as assistant coach, head coach, athletic director, and retired. and that's what I'm trying to do. Sounds like you. Yes, exactly. You know, you've had some wonderful players play for you like Jerry Jones, Barry Switzer, Jimmy Johnson. These guys have been successful in their career. Tell us a little bit about the emotion you feel inside when you see these guys who've had successful careers. I watch the cowboy and get just as nervous as I do watching the Razorbacks play and certainly when Barry and Jimmy were coaching and Barry won what three national championships and a Super Bowl I was sweating. I pulled for them for the Razorbacks. We are family. That's what we would like to be. You know you've been involved now as a leader in athletics, college athletics for 61 years. Now you got some free time. Tell me about your new passion. Well my passion is also to find a cure and to help the caregivers of all times. My wife had it. We went through the trial and error of being a caregiver for her while she was in the hospital. She was sick about five or six years and I saw the need for education. So we've developed a playbook. We've given out an all-timers Caregivers playbook Lee we've given out a hundred thousand in Arkansas We're giving out a half a million out and they're all free. We're giving out a half million all over the United States It's being translated in the Spanish in Italian and the end the nation there We're gonna have it. If we don't find a cure quickly. We're gonna have it in every country in the world It's a wonderful little practical tips guide that helps you take care of your loved one to keep her calm and keep your life. How do we get one of those through the Alzheimer's Association? Alzheimer's Association and then it's on the web also Alzheimer's playbook.com. But every chapter in America of Alzheimer's has books for everybody and they're free. We won't charge a penny for it. Coach, no one's ever won this award. It deserves it more than you. Thank you, Lee. You're a great friend. Thank you. Thank you again. Bless you. Best of luck to your new class. Jerry, thank you so much for coming. And Coach, there's one more message here. We've got a famous Arkans and wants to sail over via videotape. Good evening. I'm very sorry I couldn't be with you in person tonight to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my longtime friend and University of Arkansas coaching legend Frank Broils. Coach Broils is known far and wide for his coaching ability and his outstanding record, his unwavering commitment to excellence and his stewardship of athletes on and off the field. It is the intangibles that make Coach Boyle the kind of man he is. His career was based on his love of and his dedication to the game, his belief in service to his native state and to the people under his charge, and his commitment to creating well-rounded student athletes. I thank you for allowing me to express my appreciation to this great man. I congratulate all the recipients and nominees this evening and I want to say a special word of Thanks to Frank for a lifetime of friendship and for his continuing service and his devotion to solving the riddle, the puzzle and the pain of Alzheimer's. You're a good man, Frank. Thanks for everything."

Además para el mes de julio será parte de un gran concierto que se llevará a cabo en la capital del ecodore. haciendo un montaje especial del repertorio adaptado para la orquesta sinfónica y es muy entretenido para mí como artista es una labor interesantísima trabajar con la sinfónica, producir arreglos nuevos, tratar de buscar nuevas honoridades a canciones que se prestan para ser tocadas en este formato entonces vamos a volvernos a unir con la sinfónica el 3 de agosto en Bogotá vamos a estar haciendo un concierto que va a ser grabado y que seguramente tendremos oportunidades de compartir con ustedes después.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to see a totally different theme and we want to tell you that Andrés Peda, that's right, the Colombian Andrés Pada was in our country to promote his third simple. The message of his album, the best there is in my life. He also told us about the concert that he will give this July 5th in the city of Quito, together with those who come We want to know more about them, let's see the next note. It's our latest release, so to speak, and we're about to present the video. And, on the part of all this publicity we're making of our album, we're taking a tour, which is called The Best That I Have In My Life, which has already taken us to different Latin American countries, obviously by my country Colombia. Now we're going to visit the United States, we're going to be in Europe too, we're going to be again in Venezuela, where we came a little while ago, and with that same animal, to present the shows and talk about our album The Best That I Have In My Life. In addition, for the month of July, it will be part of a great concert that will be held And also in his country, Natal prepares a great concert with the symphony orchestra of Colombia, being this the second edition. We are doing a special recording of the repertoire adapted for the symphonic orchestra. It is very entertaining for me as an artist it is a very interesting job to work with the symphonic to produce new arrangements, try to find new sounds to songs that are offered to be played in this format. So we are going to join the symphonic again on August 3rd, Bogota, we are going to be doing a concert that will be recorded and that we will surely have the opportunity to share with you later. Thank you very much, Andrés, how about singing a little bit for the cameras, the message or maybe a little while? a little bit of the message that the choir says that the message that comes to you that tells you about me I'm asking you for forgiveness that I can't forget you a hug for all of us who see us thank you very much a greeting to prince rosa of teledama I am Andrés sepea from guayaquil Karina so prince rosa"

Vamos a tener un concierto acústico todos los días, desde el 7 al 16, en un horario en el que no perjudique al juego lógicamente, pero con un espacio adecuado, un gran escenario y con grupos representativos del panorama nacional e internacional. Nuestro objetivo es seguir dando la misma calidad de lo que es el torneo de tenis que somos, ampliar la oferta de ocio y entretenimiento, poder dar un mayor servicio de restauración y de actividades a lo que es el público en general. El público VIP está fidelizado y bien tratado, siempre ha sido así, y el público general queremos que también se sienta parte esencial, parte importante del torneo. Es un torneo mixto, como sabéis y tratamos de que la ciudad de Madrid se vuelque en un torneo de estas características. Tenemos una campaña de marketing convencional a nivel de medios offline y de medios online. Hemos hecho un precalentamiento durante un mes y medio de lo que son medios exteriores, prensa, radio y soportes de mobiliario urbano. En realidad lo que hacemos es calentar durante un mes y medio motores dando a conocer que el torneo va a llegar, va a va a instalarse la ciudad para que la gente, bueno, el público sienta que Madrid respira tenis. Nosotros lo que creemos es la estrategia de comunicación dentro del departamento de marketing y lo que es la estrategia de marketing en sí misma, donde estamos este año, donde nos queremos dirigir, aquí nos queremos dirigir, con qué herramientas y con qué código, con qué lenguaje. Y luego hemos contado con la colaboración del grupo Taumaco, es nuestra agencia de publicidad, con quien hemos desarrollado esta campaña que habéis visto en exterior por supuesto, pues toda la estrategia de lo que significa relacionarnos con nuestro CRM en la nueva web. Gracias a Dios, los patrocinadores muy comprometidos este año, aún siendo un año complicado. Tenemos al Ayuntamiento como principal patrocinador, la Mutuomadrileña, Lexus, Damm, Rolex, Rico, ISS, Tiffany y varios colaboradores más que están ayudándonos a hacer de este torneo cada año una una edición más adecuada, más sorprendente. Es una relación al largo plazo, son varios años de contrato, los que tenemos con casi todos, algunos renovables anualmente, otros son vienales y otros trienales, pero el compromiso de los patrocinadores es 100% con el torneo. No es un compromiso ni un acercamiento de, ahi no sé si me gusta o no me gusta, no, en realidad los patrocinadores saben lo que van a encontrar, saben cuál es el posicionamiento de su marca, cómo repercunte en su imagen, en su producto y están satisfechos y por eso repiten. Namizar el mayor número de actividades posibles dirigidas a su público VIP. Teníamos en cuenta que pasan más de 200.000 personas por el torneo cada año y 20.000 de estas personas son VIP. Entonces, tenemos una grandísima oferta en lo que se refiere a la restauración, que es uno de los conceptos que diferenció este torneo como único también en el mundo en este sentido.

Televisión Española está posicionando en su canal de teledeporte como temático de deporte todos los eventos deportivos. Sin embargo, a nivel patrocinio sí nos habría hecho falta haber seguido teniendo bloques publicitarios. Se respetan los acuerdos de años anteriores por los cuales por ejemplo, un mutomadrileña que invirtió en publicidad sigue conservando sus caretas de entrada y de salida, pero bueno pues lógicamente tenemos un poquito menos de visibilidad.","In this edition of the Mutomadeline Madrid Open, what it wants is to link the interests of the consumer of leisure with the interests of the consumer of sport, with which we are going to have a wide range of leisure, related to the world of culture, specifically related to music. We are going to have an acoustic concert every day from 7 to 16, in an area where it does not harm the game logically, but with an adequate space, a great stage, and with representative groups of the international and international panorama. Our goal is to continue giving the same quality of what the tennis tournament is, to expand the offer of leisure and entertainment, to be able to provide a greater service of restoration and activities to what the general public is. The VIP public is well-fledged and well-trained, it has always been so, and the general public wants us to feel part essential, part important of the tournament. It is a mixed tournament, as you know and well, we try to make Madrid City turn in a tournament of these characteristics. We have an unconventional marketing campaign at the level of the media of online and media online. We have made a pre-heating during the middle of the month of what are external media, radio press and support of the urban furniture. In reality, what we do is heat up during a month and a half motors, giving to know that the tournament will arrive, to install in the city so that the public feels that Madrid is breathing tennis. What we believe is the communication strategy within the marketing department and the marketing strategy itself. Where are we? This year, where we want to go, with what tools and code, with what language. And then we have the collaboration of the Taumaco group, our advertising agency, with whom we have developed this campaign that you have seen outside and of course the strategy of what it means to relate to our CRM on the new web. Thank you very much to the sponsors for this year, it has been a complicated year. We have the city council as the main sponsor, Mutu Madrileña, Lexus Dam Rolex, Rico ISS, Tiffany and several other collaborators who are helping us to make this tournament every year. a more adequate, more surprising edition. It's a long-term relationship. There are several years of contract, which we have with almost everyone. Some are renewables annually, others are viennals and others are triennals. But the commitment of the sponsors is 100% with the tournament. It's not a commitment or a approach of, I don't know if I like it or not, but actually the sponsors know what they're going to find, they know what their brand's positioning is, how they reflect their image, their product, and they are satisfied and repeat. To dynamize the largest number of activities possible aimed at their VIP audience. We realize that more than 200,000 people go through the tournament every year and 20,000 of these people are VIP. So we have a great offer in what is referred to the restoration, which is one of the concepts that differentiated this tournament as unique in the world in this sense. We have everything, from footballers, between the world, arts, science, sports, politics, gastronomy. It is a mandatory quote in the city's calendar. We have created a big business center where people come to see tennis, but also to a brand that can develop their business. Having a television that supports and dynamites and broadcasts a tournament at an important advertising level. However, Spanish television Spanish TV is now in the position of the sports channel, as a theme for sports, for all sports events. However, at the level of the patrocínio, we would have missed having a lot of advertising blogs. agreements of previous years, for which, for example, Mutomadrileña, who invested in advertising, still conserving her face on the media, but well, logically we have a little less visibility."

Pero bueno, aparte teníamos que este no era nuestro mapa base o nuestro home map y es que es eso del home map. Pues yo lo explico en un minutito. A ver, cuando se juega una war contra otro equipo, por lo general se juegan dos mapas, no por lo general, siempre se juegan dos mapas. Una vez, primero se juega el mapa de un equipo y luego el mapa del otro equipo. Y ahora sí, por lo general suele ser el mapa del equipo. Por ejemplo, en este caso su mapa es su home map, o sea su mapa base o su mapa de casa, que es el que tiene más entrenado y el que se sabe mejor. ¿Qué diferencia entre un mapa que se saben y un mapa que no se saben? Pues obviamente un mapa que se saben es un mapa que lo ha jugado mucho, que lo han entrenado mucho, que digamos que han pasado mucho por ejemplo. en el juego. Por lo general es más difícil jugar en su mapa y ahora diré lo segundo que era lo que se añadía de dificultad y de ahí que fuera más complicado todavía y es que empezamos atacando y es bueno que hay frenesia de gente a atacar y defender pues en un tomas la bandera como es una de las modalidades que se juegan en la LWP pues a lo mejor puede que no tanto una zona del mapa u otra pero en buscar esto y ir la defensa o el ataque es una gran diferencia o esperas que te vengan o tienes que ir a por ellos y por ejemplo no es lo mismo defender que atacar no es lo mismo esperar en un objetivo a que vengan y o matarlos o sencillamente aguantar los dos minutos y medio de ronda sin que planten con eso que ganas que te toca atacar y tengas que ir a un sitio ya sea a o b o sea un objetivo a un objetivo que te están esperando ellos en y No cuenta que lo importante no es que te den un golpe, que vayas bien y te caigas. y te han hecho tres rondas seguidas como nos pasó y apenas con una ronda a favor no te tienes que desmoronar sino levantarte echarle todo lo que puedas y luego decir pues yo al menos he hecho todo lo que he podido pero aquí como veis aquí va de un ejemplo del gameplay me mataron a mí y rápidamente el que estuvo más cerca apoyando la posición y el bomba fue a plantar y el otro que fue Tice o Epic no recuerdo bien estuvo cubriéndole por donde había un enemigo que no aparecía aquí exactamente fue a otra zona posible que ya fue a medio y efectivamente había venido corriendo aquí quedaba ya si aquí recuerdo tais escuchó los pasos y va corriendo saltó y bueno fue bastante fácil casi seis casi no seis ronda seguida canada digamos que aquí ya estamos bastante ya cogimos la confianza que de nuevo y es lo que decía no no desmoronéis está todo lo que pueda y verás cómo al final sale bien Y ahora sí, otra ronda más, después de haber hecho casi 7 o 6 rondas seguidas, intentamos cambiar de táctica, yo la ronda exteriora estuve yendo a A, digamos que para hacer presión mientras que el resto del equipo atacaba a B, que en este mapa es un poco más fácil de plantar, pero bueno aquí ya decidimos, ya quedaban dos rondas y decidimos echarlo todo, vemos todos a B, aquí vieron uno arriba, yo disparé a saco, a saco, a saco hasta que ya por fin lo vi, pudo apuntar, lo hice, iban a plantar hasta que de repente otro puntito rojo otro enemigo que había arriba y bueno vamos a aguantarle todo lo que podamos y ahí disparé no vi nada y bueno pues entonces me voy yo para este lado cada uno cubriendo una zona para evitar que que consigan llegar a la bomba y que consigan llegar a defusar y al ver que no aparecía hoy el epic y taís oyeron pasos disparos y entonces fui apoyar pero bueno ya era demasiado tarde se la había hecho y la verdad que bastante bien ya la última ronda ahora como es 8 o 3 7 rondas consecutiva a canada y ya era la última, ya era la última el último suspiro por lo menos de este mapa, pues luego ya en nuestro mapa ya nos relajamos y bueno voy a aprovechar esta parte del gameplay para explicaros un poco de digamos que un par de ejemplos de coordinación en el equipo, no? va a empezar aquí metida un par de cegadoras, yo ya sabía que había un enemigo ahí por eso le estábamos aguantando aparte Tais que era Tais y Epi que estaban detrás uno plantando Yo intento buscarme un sitio para ir cubriendo la bomba hasta que llegara a los enemigos. Al no poder subirme los barriles, me voy a cubrir la zona de antes. Hoy yo disparo arriba, intento apoyar, pero viene uno por la derecha y intento dispararle. No puedo, taes me apoya. Hay como oís con los disparos. Y yo esto seguido al decirme que hay uno arriba, intento disparar. Aunque no ve a nadie, yo disparo porque así lo que hago es que obligo al enemigo a que no salga. Obviamente si estás disparando, el enemigo no sale. enemigo no va a salir a coger las balas con el pecho y ahí ahí en eso es una de las partes que lo que consiste la coordinación y bueno esto ha sido todo ahora dejaré las fotos de cómo fuimos quedando en nuestro mapa porque con un 9.3 en defensa y un 9.3 en ataque en su mapa pues digamos que nos relajamos y nada un saludo espero que le haya disfrutado como siempre digo like favoritos suscribíos y nos vemos en el próximo vídeo chao","Hello everyone, I'm Seik1911 and today we are once again in a chapter of Modern Warfare 3 of competitive and well the truth is that today I have been a very special gameplay, the truth is that first I want you to pay a little attention below that as you can see we are losing 1-3 and well you will see the gameplay throughout that is a matter of giving it all but well no I do not want to Let's go to the gameplay and in a couple of things that I want to comment on the first in the gameplay this was a war against g2 a Spanish clan and the second thing I want to tell you is about the other that I said in the other game play of the prestige it was not 5 but 10 and these people with prestige 20 and the truth is that I'm going to make us 10 more prestige or much less I will do 5 I will stay there, so in a week I will return to normal. This does not mean that I will not upload the game mode of this week, it means that it will be old gameplays because I will be uploading prestige while you see the game play of when I was in prestige 2. And back to the gameplay, as you have seen from the beginning, it is quite long and there are many boring parts in everything that has been cut the initial part that we have lost three rounds in a row, since you did not lose anything in the other world. And well, the first thing is that there is a spectator, there is a dead one, but from here the change begins, the epic begins and why? To start we have a 1-3, which is either demoralize or lose 3 rounds and only do one. But we had that this was not our base map or our home map and what is that? I explain in a minute. When a war against another team is played, usually two maps are played, one is played generally, not always two maps. First, the map of a team is played, then the map of the other team. And now, usually, the map of the team is the home map, the base map, or the home map, which is the one that is more trained and the one that is better known. What difference does it make between a map that is known and a map that is not known? Obviously, a map that is known is a map that has been played a lot, that has been trained a lot, that has been passed a lot, You know that the positions are better, that the areas are worse, worse to attack, where you have to reinforce more, where you have to reinforce less. You are picking the idea, right? It is not the same to play in a map, let's not say new, because we have trained all the maps, but yes, we have practiced it less or we say that we have played it less against a team that has played a lot on this map. So it's usually harder to play in the map and now I'll say what was the second one that added difficulty and that was even more difficult and that is that we started attacking and well, there is a difference between attacking and defending, well, in a bad way, as it is one of the modalities that is played in the LWP, it may be that not so much, one area on the map or another, but in search of this and go for it, the defense or the attack is a great You have to go to a place that is waiting for you to attack We can either kill them or plant them, and the other team won't let you plant them. They are waiting for you to go to the objective. So, attacking, on their map, and we start with 1-3. But here we have 4 consecutive wins, 4 rounds, and we start to get a bit more morale, we start to get the game up. I think that's what encouraged us, that we didn't get the defense from the wrong side, even though we managed to do it well. And it was a matter of getting that one on the move again. It's a matter of not counting, let's say, that the important thing is not that you get hit, that you go well and you fall. The important thing is that later you throw what you have to throw and you get up. You get up and you come back. I had a good game, and I had 3 rounds in a row, as we had just one round in favor of it. You don't have to delay, you just have to get up, throw everything you can, and then say, well, I've done everything I could. But here, as you can see, here goes an example of the gameplay, they killed me and quickly, the one who was closest, supporting the position, and the bomb went to plant and the other one who was Tyce or Epic, I don't remember well, was covering him where there was an enemy. I think it didn't appear here exactly, it was in another area that was in the middle and it had actually come running here it was already here, here I remember Tais, he heard the steps and he was running, he jumped and well, it was quite easy, almost, almost, no, six rounds followed by Canada, let's say that here we are already quite, we already took the confidence that again and that's what I was telling you, do not delay, everything that you can and you will see how in the end it goes well And now, another round, after having done almost 7 or 6 rounds, we tried to change tactics, I was going to do the last rounds, to make pressure while the rest of the team was attacking B, which in this map is a little easier to plant, but here we decided, there were already 2 rounds left and we decided to do everything, we saw everything, here they came one above, I shot, I shot, I shot, I shot until I saw it, I could point it, I did it, they were going to plant until I saw it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it I was able to get a red point and another enemy up there, and I was able to get everything we could, and I shot, I didn't see anything, so I went to this side, each one covering a zone to avoid getting to the bomb, and to get to the defuse, and when it didn't appear, today the EPI, and you heard footsteps, shots, and then I went to support, but it was too late, I had done it and it was pretty good, and the last round, now as you can see, 8-3, 7 rounds with his team and the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last I try to find a place to cover the bomb until the enemy comes up I try to shoot at the top but I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can enemy will not go out to take the bullets with the chest and there is in that is one of the parts that consists of the coordination and well this has been all now I will leave the photos of how we were staying on our map because with two with a 9 3 in defense and a 9 3 in attack on his map because let's say that we relax and nothing a greeting I hope you enjoyed as I always say like favorite subscribe and see you in the next video"

Yeah, definitely. I mean, I know that there's tons of kids that feel like they have nowhere to go or no one to turn to. And so, you know, there's organizations like Jerry's Vision or Jerry's Vision in particular that you can really get involved with and just feel like part of a community and that you're welcome and make new friends. It's just awesome. And make cards. Exactly. Did you enjoy being on this project that this was something Yeah, it's been so much fun. I get to, you know, go to work and I get to paint and I get to decorate with glitter and then I go back to school. So it's just really fun. It's a great opportunity and I love to the mixture of all of the different cards there too. How can people get involved with this organization or with at least making donations so that this money's going to the Bolleen campaign? Yeah, well, you can definitely get involved by visiting jerrysvision.org or you can email me at art at jerrysvision.org. So, you know, there's other communities any organizations that you can get involved with and just downtown stores we're selling them so you can visit there and will there be a list of the stores that you can purchase them at?

They come in packs and you know that they're made with love. They definitely are handmade. Yeah. And so just donate $2 per card and now it goes to, you know, anti-bullying and just community.

You know it's it's aim to end bullying and bullying is really important to me because you know I know what it's like to be bullied and Just sort of feel like an outcast so I don't know It's really important to get youth involved and ever since I became involved with the Jerry's vision I felt you know part of a community and it's just it's been a wonderful opportunity for me I think you know and your outreach to youth right now is to find an organization that you feel that you're welcomed and a part of and so would you you know want to tell other youth that there are people that there's a place where you can feel like that you belong. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I know that there's tons of kids that feel like they have nowhere to go or no one to turn to. And so, you know, there's organizations like Jerry's Vision or Jerry's Vision in particular that you can really get involved with and just feel like part of a community and that you're welcome and make new friends. It's just awesome. And make cards. Exactly. Did you enjoy being on this project that this was something Yeah, it's been so much fun. I get to, you know, go to work and I get to paint and I get to decorate with glitter and then I go back to school. So it's just really fun. It's a great opportunity and I love to the mixture of all of the different cards there too. How can people get involved with this organization or with at least making donations so that this money is going to the Bolleen campaign? Yeah, well you can definitely get involved by visiting jerryesvision.org or you can email me at art at jerryesvision.org. So, you know, there's other communities any organizations that you can get involved with and just downtown stores we're selling them so you can visit there and will there be a list of the stores that you can purchase them at? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, we'll definitely get in touch with people about that to be able to do them. Okay. And then they can just buy a variety of cards. They come in packs and you know that they're made with love. They definitely are handmade. Yeah. And so just donate two dollars per card and it all goes to, you know, anti-bullying and just community. Well, perfect. Thank you. Thank you for the effort that you've done on the cards. And of course we've heard a lot about what the Jera's vision is able to do here in our community. Art at JeraVision is the email if you want to be able to get a hold of Kate and to be able to purchase some of these cards. Thank you. Are you going to Jera's vision today or are you going to class? Both. Both. It's a busy day for you."

Anselha Ziveta, que é neuocentista e soce diretora da Academia do Céu. Boa tarde, Dra. Boa tarde. Queria saber que realmente, o que tem que ser essa área? Bom, Tatiana, uma das coisas que mais me incomodava é que durante o tempo que eu estudei eu aprendi milhares de horas sobre português, milhares de horas sobre matemática, mas eu nunca aprendi meio horas sequer sobre como usar o meu cérebro e como fazer para que eu tivesse uma aprendizado é deficiente em termos de qualquer outra matéria então eu comecei a pensar se eu soubesse como meu cérebro funciona talvez eu pudesse tirar o tipo de jeito dele então por aí eu entrei nessa área lembro que eu queria transmitir para minha filha poder facilitar para ela a facilidade para eu sentir mas mais mais dificuldades Nessa trajetória, é cursos, porque você não tem, você só tem cursos que tratem desse tema de leuciência, de séries, tudo mais, ou menos naquela ocasião, somente paranédicos. Para uma pessoa que naquela época, como eu era leia, você não tinha nada, nem o curso, nem a informação que tinha o CIGAS. Então essa foi a maior dificuldade que eu consegui. Como é que onde vem a iniciativa de construir a Padre Médio Santo? É, foi justamente o dia, eu estive nessa dificuldade. Eu pensei que da mesma forma que queria ter esse conhecimento e precisar dessa informação, que outras pessoas também vésesis que tá sendo isso. Então eu pensei, bom, que sabe, se eu criar uma academia de série, né, assim como tem as acadêmicas do corpo, as pessoas possam ir até lá pra Turbinais e seus servos? Qual foi a coisa mais estranha e a mais gratificante que aconteceu nesse tempo na academia? Comi ou com alguém? Com a pessoa que está bem em estratar? É bom, a coisa mais... não sei se seria estranha, na verdade. Seria talvez inesperada. Eu não pensei que as pessoas precisassem tanto, valorizassem tanto. A gente tem muita atenção, o que eu acho que é estranho, isso por dizer por esse ponto de vista, as pessoas, apesar de usar o cérebro todo o tempo, nunca terem pensado na necessidade de dar ele com os sonhos de funcionar melhor. Isso também é estranho. Muito se diz sobre acelerar o aumento de KI, o aumento de trabalho que é, pode sofrer um sofrimento, pode sofrer uma visão excessiva. as pessoas também, elas têm o direito e têm já aquela oportunidade por que não nos oferimos de todos os recursos nítidos possíveis para melhorar o seu desempenho em termos de competência intelectual, equilíbrio, nacional e até respondendo àquela pergunta anterior que eu só respondi parte dela. A parte mais edificante de tudo isso para mim, para esse trabalho é perceber a felicidade das pessoas quando elas descobrem que tem potencial. Que na verdade elas não se vêem, mas podem ser escondidos, dormindo, então quando elas se descobrem nesse sentido é isso mesmo, é muito gratificante. Os outros querem não fazer uma reciclagem, porque todo o trabalho que eu faço aqui é no sentido de não criar dependência nas pessoas. O mais importante do isso é dizer para as pessoas que elas podem dar as autonomias para isso. E quando elas mesmo com a autonomia retornam, porque quer o convívio, quer o contato, querem continuar praticando, que nem sempre, as pessoas têm o perfelto de dar. A academia de genasta está aí para as pessoas ir em fazer exercício mesmo que elas possam fazer em casa e saibam o que eles precisam fazer, elas precisam de muitos estarem lá para poder ter o estesima. E muitos vêm justamente por essa área.","We are here with Dr. Anésia Zevedo, who is a neuroscientist, a social director at the Academy of Science. Good afternoon, doctor. Good afternoon. I want to know what you are doing in this area. Good, Tatiana. One of the things that bothered me the most is that during the time I studied, I learned thousands of languages ​​on Portuguese, thousands of languages ​​on Mathematics, but I never learned half a language or a language in a language about how to use my brain. And how to do it so that I would have learned a new way of thinking in terms of any other subject. So I started thinking if I knew how my brain would work, maybe I would have done it better. So that's why I entered this area. Remembering that I wanted to transmit to my daughter to be able to make it easier for her, make it easier for her to do it. But it's a more difficult thing, I think, than everything else. In this trajectory, there are courses, because you don't have, you only have courses that deal with this theme of my science, of serbius, everything else, at least on that occasion, only paramedics. For a person who at that time was a lawmaker, you had nothing, no course, no information that would help you. So this was the most difficult thing to do. How do you see the initiative to build the foundation? It was precisely the day, I had this difficulty. I thought that in the same way that I wanted to have this knowledge and need this information, that other people also need to be aware of it. So I thought, well, you know, if I create a serious academy, just like there are body academies, I think people can go there to What was the strangest thing that happened in this time in the academy? With me or with someone? With the people who treated me? It would be strange, maybe unexpected. I didn't think that people needed so much, they would value so much. I think it's strange to say this from a perspective, people, despite using the series all the time, never thought of the need to give it functions and work better. It's strange. It's strange. Many say about increasing the number of KIs, increasing the number of KLs, can you take care of this? I see it in the same way that people do in parallel, there is an opportunity through physical activity, improve your physical performance, your physical strength, your aesthetic, physically speaking, and for that they use a long physical activity, in plastic courses, and all the courses are done by the cosmetic, in the professional level, People also have the right and have the opportunity, why not? All the resources and resources are available to improve their performance in terms of international competition, national balance and even answering that previous question, that only answers part of it. The most challenging part of all this for me, for this work is to perceive the happiness of people when they discover what has happened. In fact, they feel like they are hidden, sleeping, so when they discover themselves in this way, it is this very beautiful. Others want to not do a recital, because all the work I do here, I do not feel like creating dependence on people. The most important thing about all this is to tell people that they can and give their autonomies to this. And when they first return to autonomy, why do they want to meet, want to continue practicing, that they do not know, people have the perfect way to do it. The gym is there for people to exercise even if they can do it at home. They need a lot of strength to have the strength and a lot of strength."

A wszystko co sięga emocji jest w zasadzie nedefiniowalne. My rozumiemy o co chodzi, tak domyślnie, tak jak miłość, tak jak nienawiść. Podobnie jest z definicją marketingu miejsca. Dla mnie ja mam trzy miejsca na świecie, których marketingu uprawię. Jedno to Nowa Dęba, z której pochodzę i zawsze mówię to takie niezwykłe miasto. To właśnie ten market jest kreowany przez ludzi. Drugim miejscem jest Kraków. Kraków jest dla mnie miejscem patriotycznym. Przy czym mniej patriotyczny jest dla mnie wawel. Znacznie bardziej piwnica pod baranami. Mniej patriotyczne są sukiennice. Bardziej patriotyczne jest teatr 100 z Krzysztofem Jasinińskim. Więc to jest to co gdzieś tam w nas tkwi. Trudno to zdefiniować. Jeszcze jedno bardzo sentymentalne miejsce to Żmigród bezkidzieniskim, z którego pochodzi mój ojciec. i on, i ja kiedyś jako młody chłopak gdzieś tam kuliśmy od czasu do czasu. I to jest kolejne miejsce, które niezwykle sobie cenię i promuję. To jest dla mnie definicja. To, co ci w duszy gra. Jeśli ci miejsce gra w duszy, będziesz uprawiał jego marketnik. Jeśli nie, to nie. Taka sytuacja miała miejsce w Łodzi. Kiedy okazało się, że zrezygnowano spozyskania zewnętrznej agencji, bo w Łodarze miasta doszli do wniosku, że żadna agencja zewnętrzna nie będzie miała Łodzi w sobie. będzie wykonywała to technicznie i postanowiono poszerzyć grupę ludzi pracujących wewnątrz urzędu, bo oni czują i łódź jej potrzeby i to miejsce, które mi w marketing chcą robić. To taka moja osobista definicja marketingu miejsc.","Marketing is a place, it's a difficult concept, it's hard to define, it's an emotional concept. Everything that reaches the emotion is basically undefined. We know what it's all about, we think about it, like love, like hatred. It's probably the definition of marketing. For me, I have three places in the world where I'm building marketing. One is Nowa Dęba, from which I come, and I always say it's an unusual city. This is the market and the place created by people. The second place is Kraków. Kraków is a patriotic place for me. The less patriotic place is for me in Wawel. Much more basement under the bar. Less patriotic are the Sukiennice. The more patriotic is the Stu with Krzysztof Jasinowski. So this is what is in our garden. It's hard to define it. One more very sentimental place is Żmigród. A village without a district where my father comes from. and the day when he and I, as young boys, were talking about time to time. This is another place that I usually value and promote. This is the definition for me. What is playing in your soul. If you play in your soul, you will improve its marketing. If not, then no. This situation had a place in Łódź. It turned out that the foreign agency was resigned from getting it. Because the city's owners came to the conclusion that no foreign agency would have Łódź and the heart will do it technically. And they decided to expand the group of people working inside the government, because they feel the need and the need for it, and the place they want to do marketing for them. This is my personal definition of marketing in the place."

Nuestra instrucción, con respecto al espacio del tiempo, como ya lo hemos comentado, digamos muestra o nos muestra o más que nos muestra, nos hace entender a un espacio de un tiempo como magnitudes continuas. Es decir, si uno tiene que recorrer por ejemplo, una distancia de 10 metros, sabe que antes de recorrer los 10 metros tiene que recorrer la mitad, en fin, todos los puntos intermedios que existen entre 0 y 10 metros, o sea, en espacios en continuo, para nuestra forma de percepción, el tiempo es un continuo también, porque supongamos que entre 0 y 1 minuto entre 0 y 60 segundos, también entendemos que todos los puntos intermedios de tiempo, digamos, tienen que tomarse también. Entonces, el espacio como el tiempo se supone que su armaritud es continua. Quizás esto ha traído como consecuencia el concepto de la velocidad. O sea, hablando en términos medianamente técnicos o matemáticos, la velocidad es la derivada del espacio con respecto al tiempo. ¿Qué quiere decir esto? Esto quiere decir que la velocidad es el consciente entre un espacio y un tiempo. Ese espacio normalmente es un intervalo de espacio y ese tiempo es el momento es un intervalo de tiempo si el intervalo de espacio recorrido y el intervalo de tiempo son muy pequeños se tiene lo que se llama la velocidad instantánea o sea la velocidad en un punto acá hay que observar que digamos dentro de esta definición de la velocidad como espacio sobre tiempo o como intervalo de espacio sobre intervalo de tiempo o como delta espacio sobre delta t o tomado y como decimos los matemáticos en líneas el límite del delta es sobre delta t el límite del delta es espacio sobre delta t cuando el delta tiempo tiende a cero que eso significa una velocidad instantánea si la velocidad de un cuerpo de un objeto en un punto está claro que todo esto está ligado digamos il·extricablemente muy fuerte al concepto de continuidad observa ese también que toda la evolución tecnológica que sucede a partir del análisis matemático cuando yo hablo del análisis matemático no utilizo la palabra análisis como objetivo sino me refiero a la disciplina análisis matemático digamos a la rama de la matemática que estudia el problema del cálculo diferencial que estudia la cuestión del límite que estudia las calciones de las derivadas y de las integrabes digamos esta disciplina bastante joven dentro del desarrollo porque recién ingresa a nuestro mundo occidental a partir del siglo XVI a partir de 1500. O sea, no es una casualidad que la física y el análisis prácticamente comenzaran históricamente casi en forma paralela. Es decir, la física necesitó el análisis para desarrollarse a partir de él. La historia también nos dice que los creadores de análisis matemáticos fueron dos personas, digamos en alguna medida contrarias en su quehacer, en su metíe me refiero a Limeleer que era un pensador, un filósofo con algunas inclinaciones pero no tan fuertes hacia la física y Newton que era un físico matemático y que se supone que porcentaje mayor de la matemática que él hacía, lo hacía con el interés de aplicarlo a la física Bueno, este análisis matemático que nace en el siglo XVI es, indudablemente, el responsable de prácticamente el 100% de nuestra tecnología en occidente. O sea, si en estos momentos desapareciera por equitmotivo el análisis matemático como disciplina, volveríamos prácticamente a la época de las carreta. ¿Por qué, insisto? Toda la tecnología se desarrolló a partir de eso, pero a su vez la idea es que tratar de fundamentar esta evolución científica y el problema que surge especialmente del siglo XX a partir de 1900 con los conceptos del fenómeno fotolético, la teoría de la relatividad, el principio de insistidumbre y la mecánica cuántica. Es decir, la ruptura mayor se da justamente en el problema que estamos mencionando desde el principio, el problema del continuo. entonces la siguiente nosotros decodificamos entendemos la realidad a partir del espacio y el tiempo y para nosotros el espacio y el tiempo son manitudes continuas y en la ciencia hemos aplicado este concepto que hasta cierto momento hemos creído un concepto digamos absolutamente irrevocable fuerte no solamente basado en un análisis matemático que es el cálculo diferencial sino también basado en una lógica pero este análisis matemático y ésta que tiene una base la base guste o no la sentemos o no es una base psicológica claro psicológica por qué es psicológica porque nuestra forma de decodificar la realidad nuestras psicología humana a eso me refiero nuestra psicología humana que sin duda está basada en nuestra biología o sea en cómo estamos construidos nuestra psicología en la que nos muestra esa fase ese aspecto de realidad como un continuo la naturaleza no da salto, será una frase digamos clásica en la edad media pero la historia en el desarrollo a partir del siglo XX nos está mostrando algo distinto nos está mostrando el fenómeno de la cuantificación, el fenómeno de los cuantos en cierta medida estamos volviendo a la época de demócrito cuando demócrito hablaba del átomo y que todas las cosas estaban formadas por átomos y también es interesante recordar de donde habrá sacado demócrito esta idea digamos de un mundo no continuo sino cuantificado con cuantos con partículas elementales la idea la tomó de su digamos de su guía intelectual que fue leucípio y que era un astrólogo es decir lo que es arriba es abajo lo que se afuera adentro etcétera todo este tipo de sabiduría que que alguna medida procede el maestrismo hejisto tiene que ver con esta con esta digamos dualidad pero el triunfo en la época del brido triunfo la idea del continuo y esa idea del continuo triunfo hasta el siglo XX el siglo XX con el fenómeno fotoeléctrico aparece el gran desconcierto como se hemos hablado se aparece el problema de la discontinuidad aparece el problema del mundo cuántico entonces qué sucede entre nuestra forma de entender la realidad y lo que es la realidad nosotros entendemos a la realidad como un hecho casi continuo o por lo menos la base es la realidad que es un espacio y el tiempo son continuos pero esa continuidad que nosotros suponemos válida de por sí es válida de por sí o es válida solamente como interacción entre la mente del hombre y lo que entendemos por realidad creo que la historia es bastante clara con respecto a esto y nos deja lugar a dudas La realidad aparentemente es distinta, la realidad aparentemente es discontinua y ahí aparece el mundo guántico pero es interesante entonces tratar de entender vuestra evolución a través de la ciencia y por qué esa evolución se da de esa manera y por qué de alguna forma nosotros tendemos a defender estos conceptos clásicos de un análisis referido a una matemática referido a una lógica, es una defensa en realidad de la forma que tiene el ser humano, el hombre, de entender la realidad. Esto es una cosa, lo que es la realidad es otra cosa. En si como dice Piaget, muchos otros lo han dicho también, en la historia del desarrollo de la ciencia y digamos del pensamiento del occidente, una cosa es lo que nuestra mente entiende y otra cosa distinta es la realidad, por eso que es necesario la experimentación por eso es necesario preguntarle al universo cómo realmente se comporta a tenerlos a lo que el universo nos diga y aceptar lo que es lo que es lo que nos gusta o lo que nos gusta y lo entendamos o no lo entendamos el universo se comporta de una determinada manera y así nosotros debemos tratar de entenderlo si podemos, bien de lo contrario hay que aceptarlo lo mismo","One of the fundamental problems that has to do with the history of science development is possibly the continuous problem. Our intuition regarding the space of time, as we have already mentioned, shows us or rather shows us how to understand a space of time as continuous magnitude. for example, a distance of 10 meters, you know that before you go 10 meters you have to go half, well, all intermediate points that exist between 0 and 10 meters, that is, in a continuous space for our form of perception, time is a continuous one also because we assume that between 0 and 1 minute between 0 and 60 seconds we also understand that all intermediate points of time, let's say, have to be taken too. So, the space as the time is supposed to be its continuous magnitude. Perhaps this has brought as a consequence the concept of speed. That is, speaking in terms of technical or mathematical, the speed is the derivative of space with respect to time. What does this mean? This means that the speed is the consciousness between a space and a time. That space is usually an interval of space and that time is the time. If the space interval is very small, it has to be called the instant speed. Here we have to observe that within this definition of the speed as space over time or as space interval over time or as delta space over delta t or as we say in mathematics in LISP, the limit of the delta E over delta T, the limit of the delta space over delta T when the delta time tends to zero, which means a instantaneous speed and a body's speed of an object at a point, it is clear that all this is linked, let's say, inextricably very strongly to the concept of continuity. Observe that also, all the evolution, let's say, technological that happens from the mathematical analysis when I talk about the mathematical analysis I do not use the word analysis as an objective but I mean discipline mathematical analysis let's say the branch of the mathematics that studies the problem of differential calculation that studies the question of the limit that studies the questions of the derivatives and integrals let's say this discipline quite young within the because he recently entered our western world from the 16th century, from 1500. It is not a coincidence that physics and analysis practically began historically almost in parallel. Physics needed analysis to develop. History also tells us that the creators of mathematical analysis were two persons, let's say, in some contrary measures in their journey, in their profession, I mean, Limelis, who was a philosopher with some inclinations but not so strong towards physics, and Newton, who was a mathematical physicist, and who is supposed to be the higher percentage of mathematics he did with the interest of applying it to physics. Well, this mathematical analysis that was born in the 16th century is undoubtedly responsible for practically 100% of our Western technology. In other words, if at this moment it disappeared for some reason, the mathematical analysis as a discipline, we would practically return to the era of the carts. Why do I insist? All the technology is made by the game of that, but at the same time, the idea is to try to find the fundamental evolution of science and the problem that arises especially in the 20th century, from 1900, with the concepts of the photolactic phenomenon, the theory of relativity, the principle of insistence and the quantum mechanics. The major rupture is precisely the problem that we are mentioning from the beginning, the problem of the continuous. So, the following. We decode, understand, and realize that, in the space and time, for us, the space and time are continuous manitudes. And in science, we have applied this concept that, to a certain point, we have created an absolutely irrevocable, strong concept, not only based on a mathematical analysis, which is the differential calculation, but also based on a logic. But this mathematical analysis, that has a base, the base likes us or not, we accept it or not, it is a psychological base, of course, why is it psychological? because our way of decoding reality, our human psychology, that is what we refer to, our human psychology, which is undoubtedly based on our biology, that is, how we are built, our psychology in which it shows us that face, that aspect of reality as a continuous one, Nature does not give rise to a classic phrase in Middle Ages, but history in development, from the 20th century, is showing something different, it is showing the phenomenon of quantification, the phenomenon of quantification. At some point we are returning to the time of the democritus, when the democritus spoke of the atom and that all things were formed by atoms. It is also interesting to remember where this idea of a world that was not continuous but quantified with elements, was taken from his intellectual guide and which was an astrolom. that some measure proceeds from Hermes Trismegisto, it has to do with this duality, but the triumph, at the time of the Great, triumphed the idea of ​​the continuous, and that idea of ​​the continuous triumphed until the 20th century. In the 20th century, in the photoelectric phenomenon, the great discontent appears, as we have talked about, the problem of discontent, the problem of the quantum world appears. So what happens between our way of understanding reality and what is reality. We understand reality as a almost continuous fact, or at least the basis of reality, which is the space and time, are continuous. But that continuity that we assume is valid for itself, is valid for itself, or it is valid only as an interaction between the mind of man and what we understand for reality. I think that history is quite clear with respect to this and it doesn't leave us with a doubt. The way we understand reality is the continuous reality. The reality is apparently different. The reality is discontinuous. And there appears the guantic world. But it is interesting to try to understand our evolution through science. And why does that evolution take place in that way? And why, in some way, we want to defend these classic concepts of an analysis referring to a mathematical theory a logical one, which is a defense in reality of the way humans have to understand reality. This is one thing, what reality is another thing. As Piaget says, and many others have said it too, in the history of science development and the thinking of the West, one thing is what our mind understands and another thing is different in reality. That is why it is necessary the experimentation. That's why it is necessary to ask the universe how it really behaves. To have what the universe tells us and accept what it tells us. Whether we like it or not, we understand it or not, the universe behaves in a certain way and thus we must try to understand it. If we can, well, on the contrary, we must accept it the same way."

This is called our first home. We moved to R.H.H. in 1979, our first home. I was so excited. The previous owners had moved to Alabama or Georgia or somewhere down south months earlier and we're renting out the house to a family. We contracted to buy the house in March but we couldn't move in until September when the tenant's lease was up. It was the longest six months ever. All I could think about was the house. How I was going to decorate it. I moved the furniture around in my brain, but I couldn't remember some of the details. How big was the living room? Would my curtains be long enough for the bedroom windows? What color was the bathroom tile? Sometime in May or June when I couldn't stand it any longer, I called the tenants to ask if we could come over to take some measurements. They agreed and we arrived with a tape measure, a camera, a pad of lined paper, and a pencil. I took some black and white pictures and I measured everything, the size of every room, every window, and every doorway. I don't think Rich had any idea I was planning such an assault. We must have been there a couple of hours when he finally convinced me that we had overstayed our welcome and it was time to leave. When we got back to the apartment, I pulled out a pad of graph paper and I got started. I made a diagram of every room in the house. The next day at work, I made copies on the Xerox machine. Then I cut and pasted the rooms together until I had a layout of the whole house. Then I measured all our furniture and cut out smaller pieces of graph paper for each piece. Now I could move the furniture around on my graph paper while I anxiously awaited for moving day. The magic day finally arrived. We rounded up some friends to help move our belongings. We were excited to show off our new home. Our friends, however, didn't have quite enough time the reaction we were looking for. They just smiled and nodded. Oh, hmm, they said. They apparently thought we actually liked the bright blue shade carpeting in the living room and dining room, and the kitchen cabinets that were painted black and had strips of ebony stained gouge wood tacked on the front. The ebony stained wood was repeated in the three-quarter inch thick moldings that were attached with ten penny nails throughout the living areas. The dining room had two different wallpapers. One was a solid red and the other was black with silver figurines. The light fixture looked like a headpiece that might have been belonged to Brunhilde. One of the bedrooms had pink paneling in two different shades. Another bedroom had a mural that had been painted by the owner's cousin on Sanitas wallpaper. The wallpaper in the half-bath resembled a quilt with various patterns in brown, tan, and orange. No, it wasn't our taste. But we had heeded the advice of our real estate agent who said to look beyond the decorations. Those things can always be changed. And she was right. The house had good bones. It was structurally sound. The floor plan worked for us. The neighborhood was quiet and the school district was well-rated. So what if we had to change the carpet, remove some wallpaper and paint the kitchen cabinets? We could do that. And we did, although it took quite a bit of time. longer than I had originally anticipated. We did eventually get rid of the blusher carpet and the ugly kitchen cabinets and the hideous wallpaper. But as anyone who has ever owned a home will tell you, you're never really done. As soon as you finish one project, there's another one to take its place. I'm ready to tackle the kitchen again.

This time, I am here to teach you the most important thing in English in the OMS English Education. It is a very simple language language principle for the memory 1080, a learning memory of a popular language language. The process of repeating the time difference and the spelling is repeated and the words can be experienced by the amazing experience of the words being engraved in the brain. This principle was used to use the principle of the Manggak border of the Abing House. For the last five years, tens of thousands of students have experienced the concept of word-in-word. Using this principle, you can challenge the concept of the word-in-word for 3 months. In the memory 8080, the English pronunciation is described in the English language. The memory is a test function in the memory 1080. The Mb3 has been installed for a long time in the brain science with the function of maximizing the power and concentration of the digital voice recording. The digital voice recording function can be stored up to 998 or 998, such as the power, power or the design. The Mb3 function can be heard by storing music, English conversation and English broadcast."

Acá hay muchos urbolitos que tiene a súsa ibalista e que bueno que es eso porque a seibalita ha sido un gran paso tecnológico e que bueno que nuestros chicos estén conectados con la tecnología. Non es así, Dr. Valle, bienvenido Jorge. A pesar de venírem un fin de semana que seguramente foi agenteado a agente que non é un culpavo, é?","Thank you very much, Dr. Luis Alberto, the street. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Uruguayas, Uruguayos, dear friends, my dear Aysa, I'm leaving because I brought this to the East. Festige, Uruguayos, festige, how are we going to celebrate? If we are going to spend a moment less, less than we want, obviously, And we are today in a great moment of a great place because Uruguay is a great, calm country. I look like the ones from Cuba or the ones from Argentina. Thank you very much, it is a strong professional applause. People are so precise in the government. If I get shot for the next terrorist attack. Uruguay. Uruguay. Uruguay hit. Here there are many furballists who have their saibali, and it's good that it's that, because the saibali has been a great technological step and it's good that our boys are connected with technology. That's not the case, Dr. Valle, welcome Jorge. despite coming a weekend that was probably set up by the people who are present. We are not guilty, are we?"

And so you were able to roll out a new kind of command structure at city or at the police department headquarters downtown. I just kind of wanted to follow up on the question earlier. Is that something you'd been wanting and thinking about for a longer time? Well we're always looking at the department internally, you know, what changes just make a lot of sense when when Mayor Perry talked to me about wanting to use some consolidation up on the 5th floor of the main station. I said it was perfect. It makes a lot of sense. We can reduce down to three bureaus. There's some natural alignments that take place by moving the Scientific Evans Division under investigations. It creates a very clear chain of command in doing those long-term investigations. We also looked at the support bureau. Now what we have is everything that supports directly the men and women who answer those calls for service is in one bureau. So the tactical division, the traffic division, the records people, everything that is a support issue to people answer those calls again is now under one unified chain of command which should help streamline efficiencies and operations. Political elections are always bring out silly season but you and I are both not naive that there have been kind of this understated reports out there and feelings among some police officers that morale in the department hasn't been good. Do you think that the new command structure you rolled out tonight and your reappointment will boost morale again? Well I hope so. I mean there's a lot of good things going on within the department. department. Officers have a good compensation package that's currently in place. Just getting to our goal of 1100 officers, there's more officers on the field, more officers answering calls for service. We continue to be innovative in reducing calls for service by using the new computer system that we have by having online reporting. We're going to continue to do that. We also have an ad hoc committee that's been meeting for several months looking at changing the way we prioritize calls, which I think the average field officers gonna like, and which calls are gonna get sent to, and which calls may be deferred to other means, such as telephone recording. And so, you know, two years ago you shifted officers from four 10s to five eights. And the idea was to increase or reduce response times to make response time faster. But a couple of months ago, I guess in April, you put the overdone officers back on four 10s. Why'd you do that? Well, one of the things we said is that As we continue to grow the department we would look at changing hours to make it what the officers want and officers made it very clearly like a 410 schedule. Several months ago we were able to move a portion of those officers back to a 410 schedule when we got up to about 1,050 officers now at 1,100. So we'll continue to evaluate the shifts that officers work. We'll continue to monitor the calls for service and the response times and we'll make adjustments as we can. management is being flexible and being able to find what works best. Exactly. And that's one of the things we've done is we brought on a new computer information system that changes the way we dispatch calls. Anytime you bring a new system into play, things change. And what we found out is a new system now is getting much more faster and much more efficient. We're getting calls from the time that first phone call rings in 911 Center. We're getting into the officer's car faster. Well, that's improving response times. And with that, it gives us more free time and more free time. free time. Some of the overnight officers say they're due a lot of money and back over time from the fact that when they got shifted to five eights, it increased their wait time to go to court. There was a an issue filed by the Howard Creek Police Officers Association. It was an agreement made several months ago. There's actually an auditor who's been reviewing time sheets. And I believe several of the officers actually will be compensated in an extra half hour. of time that they had due to them. So everybody who has time coming will be properly compensated. Yeah, but the collective bargaining agreement called for more than a half hour. Is that right? No, I believe it's a half hour that was due to the officers because of time they got off and when morning court started. So I believe it's 30 minutes per officer per court appearance.","Does this reappointment show how important it is to keep politics out of the police department? that even more than we have been in the past.

This is past the tige coming to you from success paradigms 101 where we believe that we can help you to make it happen We are talking success principles the tools that you need to succeed in life They tell us that only a small percentage maybe three to four percent of the people in the world will succeed We believe we can start a success pandemic we can get many people to jump on the success boat But it requires that you follow the principles life is governed by principles follow the principles you will Today we want to talk briefly on the third principle which is faith. What is faith? The Bible tells us faith is the substance of things all for. That's in Hebrews chapter 11. But the Bible also tells the just shall live by his faith. In other words if the vision he talks about in verse 1, 2 and 3 is going to become a reality, you're going to have to live by faith. He says then verse 2 and 3. He says the vision is the substance of faith. is for an appointed time, though it tarry, it will not tarry, it shall come to pass, and it shall not lie, it will speak plainly and clearly. But you've got to be one of those that is gonna live by faith. One of the ingredients that you will see, which is common amongst very successful people in the world, is that they believed that failure was not an option. They believed that they planned, they dreamed, their vision had to succeed. If you're gonna make it, there will be many challenges. many storms, there will be many things that will come to you and tell you you cannot make it. Look at all the great inventors. They had an opportunity to give up. They had an opportunity to say this will never work. They were told by their friends. Some of them were told by relatives. In fact, a few of the inventors were taken to a silent place where people that were crazy and losing their minds were taken to because friends and family thought they were going crazy. You will have to have a gut feeling something on the inside of you that pushes you on and says this I'm not going to let it fall. I'm not going to let it fail. So many people give up at the turning point, at the miracle point, at the break point. They give up when things are about to work out for them. I want to encourage you. I want to challenge you today. What dream have you given up on? What vision have you given up on? What plans have you put on paper? Have you begun to pursue? That you began to feel and tell yourself and maybe others told you it will never work. It'll cost you too much. It's too difficult. No one in your color, in your race, in your family, in your tribe has ever done this. Today I want to challenge you. Begin to build a faith, a tenacious faith that says this thing cannot fail it will work. In fact, faith is one of the ingredients that is key in many areas of your life. If you're going to succeed, remember we said success is the progressive realization of a worthwhile goal. Whatever your goal is, it might be to build a hospital, it might be to start a school, it might be to invent a that we're helping in engineering. Whatever the vision is, it is easy to give up. And so many times people give up when things are about to turn. Today my challenge to you today is you can make it. You don't have to give up.

God is the one that will help you to succeed and to realize your dream. Have faith in the vision. A lot of people have very little faith in the vision that they are putting together. Have faith in the vision. Have faith in that it will work. Have faith in the people that will come around you to begin to support the vision, to make the vision a reality. My challenge to you today is this. Look at your life. Look at the areas where fear, doubt, and doubt are the ones that will help you succeed. Have faith in God. God is the one that will help you to succeed and to realize your dream. Have faith in the vision. Believe you, you will make it. Thank you so much. This is Pastor Tayan Iwa coming to you from Success Parodymes 101 where we believe we can help you to make it. God bless.","Welcome. This is past the tige coming to you from success paradigms 101 where we believe that we can help you to make it happen We are talking success principles the tools that you need to succeed in life They tell us that only a small percentage maybe three to four percent of the people in the world will succeed We believe we can start a success pandemic We can get many people to jump on the success boat But it requires that you follow the principles life is governed by principles follow the principles you will Today we want to talk briefly on the third principle which is faith. What is faith? The Bible tells us faith is the substance of things all for. That's in Hebrews chapter 11. But the Bible also tells us that just shall live by his faith. In other words, if the vision he talks about in verse 1, 2 and 3 is going to become a reality, you're going to have to live by faith. He says then verse 2 and 3, he says the vision is the substance of faith. is for an appointed time, though it tarry, it will not tarry, it shall come to pass, and it shall not lie, it will speak plainly and clearly. But you've got to be one of those that is gonna live by faith. One of the ingredients that you will see, which is common amongst very successful people in the world, is that they believed that failure was not an option. They believed that they planned, they dreamed, their vision had to succeed. If you're gonna make it, there will be many challenges. many storms. There will be many things that will come to you and tell you you cannot make it. Look at all the great inventors. They had an opportunity to give up. They had an opportunity to say this will never work. They were told by their friends. Some of them were told by relatives. In fact, a few of the inventors were taken to a silent place where people that were crazy and losing their minds were taken to because friends and family thought they were going crazy. You will have to have a gut feeling something on the inside of you that pushes you on and says this I'm not going to let it fail. So many people give up at the turning point, at the miracle point, at the break point. They give up when things are about to work out for them. I want to encourage you. I want to challenge you today. What dream have you given up on? What vision have you given up on? What plans have you put on paper? Have you begun to pursue? That you began to feel and tell yourself and maybe others told you it will never work. It'll cost you too much. It's too difficult. No one in your color, in your race, in your life, in your life, in your life. in your family, in your tribe has ever done this. Today I want to challenge you. Begin to build a faith, a tenacious faith that says this thing cannot fail it will work. In fact, faith is one of the ingredients that is key in many areas of your life if you're going to succeed. Remember we said success is the progressive realization of a worthwhile goal. Whatever your goal is, it might be to build a hospital, it might be to start a school, it might be to invent a or a tool or a gadget that has not been invented before, that will help medical science, that will help in engineering. Whatever the vision is, it is easy to give up. And so many times people give up when things are about to turn. Today my challenge to you today is, you can make it. You don't have to give up. If others made it because they believe they could, you can make it today. Never give up on your vision. Never give up on your dream. We have tools and resources that we have put together that will be a blessing to you that will encourage you that will help you to begin to look at the vision in a practical way in a way that helps you to make it a reality. He spoke in his word and he says I know the thoughts the plans the purposes that I have for you that I think towards you plans for good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end that's what God has for you we can help you to make it happen. We also have a book that will be coming out shortly the book will help you success paradigms 101 filled with wisdom Success principles from the word of God case studies and examples of men and women Just like you that had odds against them that had challenges coming against them But they still succeeded you can succeed you can't make it learn the principles apply the principles and you begin to see your life turning around Begin to believe in your heart that you can make it What must you have faith in have faith in you have faith in yourself have faith that God has put inside of you the necessary have faith in God. God is the one that will help you to succeed and to realize your dream. Have faith in the vision. A lot of people have very little faith in the vision that they're putting together. Have faith in the vision. Have faith in that it will work. Have faith in the people that will come around you to begin to support the vision, to make the vision a reality. My challenge to you today is this. Look at your life. Look at the areas where fear, doubt, and fear are all the same. and you, you will make it. Thank you so much.

And what happens is that when it rains not so often here, the mosquito tree will collect that rain from the sides and push the water, not up to the leaves, but rather down to that bottom route. And then it'll collect it as like reservoirs down there. So when it gets into the drought, it will then bring that water back up and then you'll see It's really cool concept that was discovered here on the Santerita experimental range Also what I think is pretty supernatural if you water just this side of the tree It'll actually take the water with its roots and move it to the other side of the tree Which is a pretty cool concept I mean you never really think of like plants being alive But this one definitely has some humanistic qualities I would even say so that's the mosquito tree and that's all I have for you today might be giving you another video about black lighting and that's all for now.

And you have seen what we're doing at education, but you can do that for every other sphere. You could do that for business, you could do that for government, for media, for arts, for sport, for the social services and for the whole sphere of church. To mobilize people with a different understanding, that is the key."

He would have attended Reed College that fall.","Mac, Giovengo, Shoreline, Alexander, memorial, MacCready, Melinda, Wesley",76,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/ZSZ1-4Njfgw.mp3,"This is a more than tragic occasion in my life and looking out I can see in most of you as well I had an interesting relationship with Alex And I'm so glad Jamie stepped in After the rap song because I thought he was gonna get me one more time by having me have to come up after a rap song knowing I'm not a big rap fan There's been a number of those occasions since his passing one is when his aunt Katrina and me a dress to wear to Memorial in Cochreye. Those of you who know me know I don't wear dresses and I thought, wow, he is going to get me over and over again. So there I was in a dress thinking only for Alex. And then I had a dream where I was packing a car to bring somewhere and there was a box that kept coming up by my feet that I kept kicking away and it kept coming and I kept moving. it back and putting it back in place and finally opened it up and there was a bright blue grover from Sesame Street with his arms out like this looking up as only Alex can do. I now own a bright blue grover that I have by my bed every night to keep him close. Alex was a mischievous young man. I was, I'm from I guess you would call it the other side of the family, but Liz and I go way back as well. We spent a childhood together. We built a family together with Scott and with Alex. I was the one that said, cut your hair, take a bath, eat your vegetables, do your homework, and yes, I can help with the book report. I was that person who picked him up and threw him in a tub most times when I saw him and made him go to bed. that we had a lot of fun. We laughed. We traveled and explored and he was the kid with the too many rocks in his pockets. And the filthy fingernails carrying the frog up to our faces and chasing armadillos so that they ran over me. He was the kid that sat behind me on many, many, many a journey to Whistler Mountain with his foot under my seat doing this, the hole, time to the point where you turn around with your hand poised and you whip around and he had a grin on his face that you would never be able to avoid joining. And so I would laugh as would everyone else in the car after hundreds and hundreds of miles of him doing that. He was the kid who when I ran my first triathlon I was dead tired and laid in a sleeping bag in a tent that came in and would not leave me alone. To the point where I was screaming at his father to get him out of there. I was screaming at my friend Keela to come get him away from me or I was going to kill him. And I finally got up and dragged him out by his feet into the middle of which he just simply came back in and I simply had to get back up. That's what we did. I was his nanny. He would call from parking lots say, uh, Neenie, what are you doing? I'm hungry. Oh, okay. Like out of the blue. Can you bring me something? And I'd say, and he goes, and six of my friends. And I believe that the Batemans were at the house that day when I began to make peanut butter sandwiches and drove them to a parking lot. I was the person he would sit down and do a book report with. And if those of you have ever read the ear, the eyes and the hand, it's some kind of kids book. And he wrote a book report and I was editing it and not once in this mystery of a book report did he mention the ear of the eyes and the hand. Now I have to tell you that if you title a book, the ears, the eyes and the hand, it has to have something to do with the story. I would have never guessed that this child would have been the prolific and beautiful writer that he was as I sat there and tried to figure out what in God's name the ear of the eyes and the hands meant and basically made it up as we went along. He was a joy He was a pill. He was funny and he was loving and many times he did not know that. When he was a small child we were camping as I'm looking out at our family and realizing and he fell with a life jacket on into an ice cold river. It was a glacier fed lake and he said not one word. Not one word and his lips were freezing. He was turning blue in his face and I threw him back in the boat and I said son why didn't you say something and he never answered and I realized then that in order to love Alex you had to reach in that he wasn't going to reach out that if I wanted him close I had to pull him close and so I spent the years after that trying to pull him close and hold him near. He went through some awful times, and as a matter of fact this lovely scenery we're on now, I remember being down here hunting his hide, and not, you know, not, you know, for a joyful reason. I remember trying to find him many a night, worried for his safety, because, well, I'm just that kind of nag. And then he would show back up. When he went away to wilderness, he wrote me a letter and he had a couple of things to say. One was, thank you for never expecting less of him than he was. And thank you for looking over your glasses at me because he always knew that that meant he was only at 89%. And then before he died, The last time I saw him I was trying to take a nap again, which you might think I spend a lot of time napping. He came in and laid beside me in my bed and proceeded to talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. And I realized that I never wanted him to shut up, that it was such a joy to listen to who this young man had become. From the boy that got whisked away to wilderness, to the young man I saw when I showed up at John Dewey who wanted to see the Sistine Chapel and that I had promised him to take him there as soon as he was ready and that we would see all those beautiful things that he had become so close to in his life. And so what I think of when I think of Alex is I think of a gift. When you live 3,000 miles away from your family and when you you're alone or a single parent, you have the luxury of being able to bring people together that are your family and you make new what it lives far away. And I see everyone out there, Elena and Sasha, is that Elsa? Keela, Liz, I see you all out there and I remember the family, Leslie and Matt, that we all made together and how we tried to wrap him and Scott and all of us in love. And a gift is something that just kind of happens. You know, you didn't ask for it, didn't expect it, didn't deserve it. It didn't belong to me, but I got it. And I got to love that gift freely and without strings and without complications. And for that, I wanna thank Liz and Scott. for the gift that I will treasure my whole life. He wrote in the last letter to Kathy and I that we were family and that he loved us and that when he had doors, they would always be open for us. And I can only hope now as he went out in that ocean laughing and actually calling for help, I can only hope now that he has his door and that when I join him, I will be able to walk through his door. Thank you.","This is a more than tragic occasion in my life and looking out I can see in most of you as well I had an interesting relationship with Alex And I'm so glad Jamie stepped in After the rap song because I thought he was gonna get me one more time by having me have to come up after a rap song knowing I'm not a big rap fan There's been a number of those occasions since his passing one is when his aunt Katrina and me a dress to wear to memorial in Kosch Rai.

So it's just metallic. It's not shimmery, but it's just a bit metallic. And other than pigment, it's a groupie. Water buff, so if you're thirsty, or if you have a water bath, you can stay on waste. It's not going to sponge anywhere. For example, and it's not common at all just stick it there not even a smudge, not a difference I think the quality is more than 85,000 so worth to buy and this hip-call also has several colors besides black shop and green flesh, there is gold, silver, purple if you don't mind and other things that I forgot and the one that I will definitely buy soon because I like it I don't have any color, because I said before that the water proof line is very thick, so it's just a line that can be applied. There is a thin layer of color, if it is rubbed, it can stay on place. If it is wet, it can be applied. And my eyelid is a little oily. But as long as I use it for a day, it doesn't have any color. or not oily, just keep it good, keep it cheap, or I'm more beautiful. You can get the product, keep it safe, I don't know, I bought it for a long time, but with 85,000, you get the product that you bought a long time ago. So that's the word to buy. Okay, that's all my review, hope you guys are useful, see you in the next review. Bye bye. Thank you for watching!"

October 2008, it is 301 yen. The total amount of 1153 yen will be increased to 1,155 yen. If you come out of this, you will get the target of 1,350 yen. The price of the 3rd month is 1490 yen.

Yeah, I'm not saying I wanted to see his legs. I just bringing it up.

Rhino Page in the ninth working off a strike from his partner Chris Barnes. Make it two in a row. Rhino sets up the 10th frame now for Chris Barnes. If Chris strikes out they shoot 223 which means that all. Mika and Fagan would have to do is mark in the 10th frame. to win. And there is no endless 10 frame here in the championship round. You are correct Bobby. Thank you Raymond. It's Randy. Randall. I'm alright with Randall. Jimmy. I'm good with Randall. John. Another shot that goes high for Chris Barnes. This match is history. Picks up the spare. He'll have one more toss. Well I tell you on paper Barnes, reigning player of the year and Rhino Page, the rookie of the year. It looks like it would have been a one-sided event going up against Mika and Michael Fagan, but not to be. Mika pulled extremely well. Fagan threw some key strikes in there. In fact, Mika has been perfect in this match. to win this and they will take a two point to none lead going into the final team competition, which is worth two points. That's right. So plenty still to play for in our match. Well, this makes it do our time now for Mark Ross team, where they will have to win the team event in order to have any chance in this competition. If they win that two point team event, there will be a team roll off. It's neither here nor there. That's for another show. Nico walk away with that nine and a 233 to 201 victory.

Now before the match Mika said to me you better strike or I will break you. So I had to do it. I had to keep striking to make my spares and and he obviously showed up big time. He just packed five shots in a row so it was easy with him on the team. And Mika how will you use this momentum going into the team event? We have a really strong team. We have the sixth grade guys here and just need to ride with the wave and I think with this team it's easy. Say good luck at the updated standings and it's pretty simple. Two wins get you two points.

Takes care of the single pin spare pickup. Rhino Page in the ninth. Working off a strike from his partner Chris Barnes, make it two in a row. Rhino sets up the 10th frame now for Chris Barnes. If Chris strikes out they shoot 223, which means that all. Mika and Fagan would have to do is mark in the 10th frame. to win. And there is no endless 10th frame here in the championship round. You are correct, Bobby. Thank you. Raymond. It's Randy. Randall. I'm all right with Randall. Jimmy. I'm good with Randall. John. Another shot that goes high for Chris Barnes. This match is history. Picks up the spare. He'll have one more toss. Well, I tell you, on paper, Barnes, grinding player of the year and Rhino Page, the rookie of the year. It looks like it would have been a one-sided event going up against Mika and Michael Fagan, but not to be. Mika pulled extremely well. Fagan threw some key strikes in there. In fact, Mika has been perfect in this match. to win this and they will take a two point to none lead going into the final team competition which is worth two points. That's right. So plenty still to play for in our match. And this makes it do our time now for Mark Ross team where they will have to win the team event in order to have any chance in this competition. If they win that two point team event there will be a team roll off. It's neither here nor there. That's for another show. Nico walk away with that nine and a 233 to 201 victory.

Congratulations on your win. You're now up to 0 and clearly Mike you didn't have any difficulty understanding your finished teammate. Now before the match Mika said to me you better strike or I will break you. So I had to do it. I had to keep striking to make my spares and and he obviously showed up big time. He just packed five shots in a row. So it was easy with him on the team. And Mika how will you use this momentum going into the team event. We have a really strong team. We have the six great guys here and just need to ride with the wave and I think with this team it's easy. Say good luck at the updated standings and it's pretty simple. Two wins get you two points. Carmen's cartel in control but up next the two point Baker style team match the final match of this championship round and you can see it. Today 2.30 Eastern the final match of the Geico PBA team shootout. Meika was awesome in this doubles match, shredding racks, throwing strikes, and Michael Fagin got on and rode into victory. Yeah!

Those who have experienced the greatest problems of the two-time Asian and Latin American countries, know that it has caused complete suffering in the national institutions and on its head is the dead box. The crisis of the Latin America has caused the eight-time crisis, which has been known as the loss of the crisis. The documents have been created by countries that have been forced to renew it. The government has issued a bill that will quickly provide financial assistance to the United States to resolve the issue of free access. The bill also imposed a bill on South America's economy, which is a non-profit application, when the income and income are lost. The bill did not succeed in eliminating the economy of the United States, which has witnessed a dramatic fall in the number of cases due to the decrease in government spending. The level of living for citizens, which caused the emergence of a common popular anger, has increased by the introduction of the international financial institution. In the 1990s, the image of the national currency box was displayed to increase the value of the crisis in Asia. The Asian numbers that have been raised to build its national policy, and in accordance with the box standards, which are achieved by the promotion of the financial sector, increasing the profits of the companies, and reducing the profits of the US dollar. and the state's support for the development of the economy.

Today, the fraud of the State Bank is standing in the face of the disease European leaders, known as the European regime's power to continue its struggle, have asked a national question about the size of the circle that could be put in the face of the crisis."

Ik ga je een aantal mooie zomerse lipgluren laten zien. Ik ga je laten zien hoe je het kunt aanbrengen en ik geef tips hoe het er mooi blijft zitten en hoe je het mooist kunt aanbrengen, etc. Dus ik heb een aantal mooie lipgluren uitgekozen die vooral heel zomer zijn. Veel loopbidget natuurlijk zoals je van mij gewend bent. Ik hou van loopbidget. Maar ook wat halloe en merk. Dat is wel duurderen lipsticks. Kun je zelf uitkiezen wat bij jou past. Ook de kleuren zijn variërend zodat je het helemaal kunt toepassen zoals jij wilt. Zonder ver de lipstik voel ik me toch vaak een beetje kaal. En niet alles is veel trouwens, er zitten ook rustigere tinten tussen. Dus laat het snel beginnen. Ik heb een aantal lipkleuren uitgezocht, lipsticks maar ook andere vloeibare lipproducten. En wat bij de zomer denk ik wel belangrijk is, is dat je lipstik lang blijft zitten. Het is natuurlijk doodhedenjaar door belangrijk, maar nu zweet je meer en dan kan we toch een beetje shabby uit zien met je afgesweten makeup en alles. Dat willen we niet. Nou daardoor kan ik je zeker aanraden onder een lipliner onder. Ik heb hier een aantal lipliners. Ik vind die van MAC heel erg fijn. En deze van P2. Dat hebben we helaas niet in Nederland. Ik heb deze in Duitsland gekocht. En een lipliner is ook heel fijn dat je weet waar je lipstik moet zetten. Maar als je heel lippen ermee incleert, blijft je lipstik ook echt veel langer zitten. Eerst de zomerslipklor die ik wil laten zien is deze Stehmud Lip Cream van Essence. Dit is Velvet Rose. En ik ga hem nu gelijk even oploen. Het is een vloeibare lip product, maar hij is monsterof. en heel erg dekkend. Het is dus absoluut geen lipgloss, plakt het hem nog niet. En hij is heel erg mooi. En hij is heel erg zacht ook. En hij ruikt heel lekker. Ik vind het een mooie, zachte lipkler voor overdag, voor helpje werk of je school. En dan heb ik een hele leuke lipstick van NYC. En dit is de NYC City Do It Lip Color in Nureward 430 de Rock of Velvet. En deze heeft twee kleuren. Ik heb hem al eens eerder laten zien. Nou, dit vind ik ook echt superhandig voor de zomer, omdat het A hele zomerse kleuren zijn. Een beetje een periscic en een iets fellere korene. Maar het is ook heel makkelijk als je een meningt. Je kunt door de dag heen gewoon afwisselen. Nou breng ik eventjes de lichte kleur aan. En ik krijg nog vragen of het moeilijk was om aan te brengen maar dat vind ik helemaal niet. Je brengt ook gewoon iets platter aan en eh... Nou ja, het gaat echt heel goed. Ook dit is een hele zachte kleur. Net, ja, iets meer oranje en iets veller dan de vorige kleur die ik liet zien van Essence. Ook heel perfect. Weer een stapje verder en ook heel erg zomers. Nu heb ik de tweede kleur aangebracht wel over de andere kleur iets, maar ze dekken allebei heel erg goed. dat je bijna niet het verschil merkt. Ziet dat ze gewoon wel gewoon goed overheen kunnen. En nou dit is weer een iets bellerkleur. Ook allerwaar humorig zomers, lekker romig en glitter. Wat glitter kan wel heel goed bij de zomer, maar ik denk dat als je huid al wat glanzend is van full to highlighter of gewoon omdat het er echt warm is en je een beetje weet, dan is glitter erin misschien wel weer een beetje toe much. Dus dan is een mattekleur of een romig, want hij is niet echt matt, maar gewoon romig. Matt is wel die van Essence die ik voor jullie te zien. Dan kan het prima. De tweez vind ik echt heel erg mooi. Dit is de Mad about Pink en ik draag hem echt super veel. Ik breng hem aan en roog op hop en hij is echt prachtig. En wat ik ook altijd doe, is dan draag ik een vrij neutrale oogloop bij met goudtinten en een bruin dan. Matenbruine kleurtjes. En dan pop deze echt heel erg mooi bij uit met een glansende blush. Helemaal goed. Oh ja en lips ik zo aanbrengen. Het lijkt misschien lastig maar het is echt in de kwestie van oefenen. Op een gegeven moment dan weet je gewoon hoe je lippen zitten, hoe je moet aanbrengen. maar zit nu in het vaste assortiement is wel continu uitverkocht omdat hij zo populair is. Hij is een heel erg fuccavel, heel cool en ik draag daar ook dan een lipliner onder omdat met die lichtrekleur zoals ik net liet zien die vervage vaak mooier en wat egaaner terwijl hele felle kleuren zoals Kenny Hummum blijft vaak alleen zo'n randje zitten. Het lijkt me heel vaak als je een snorretje hebt omdat er alleen de bovenkant van je lippen daar dan nog een randje blijft zitten omdat hij nooit gezien is. en hier slijdt het snelst omdat je liep elkaar daar raken. Dus, Kenny Hummium, dus echt een hele velle, ja hele vrolijke zomerslipstick. Hierbij hoef je echt je ogen maar heel natuurlijk op te maken of gewoon een grote zonder bril op te doen, haren los en je bent helemaal klaar voor. Dus die ga ik nu aanbrengen met het lippotloopt en Brace Me van Mac Air onder. Nou en dat is Kenny Hummium, weer ook echt heel erg gaaf. Dit is echt een hele lekkere velle, roze fuccakleur. Ik heb er 3 koele kleur dus het moet je van houden en dan moet je staan. Persoonlijk hou ik zelf niet iets warmere kleuren. Maar als je mijn cup erop aan past kan eigenlijk alles wel. Het is meer ook een kwestie van smaak. En dus een goede manier om te combineren. Dus dat is het kennen yum yum. Die naam is ook zo leuk. Yum yum. Yum yum. En dan was het laatste nummer 5. Mijn lippen zijn ondertussen helemaal rood. Een pijnlijk van al het zwartje of lippkleur op proberen. Deze van Chanel. Dit is La Favorite. En dit is een rode lipstick. Ik vind deze persoonlijk echt heel mooi samen met... Dus het is nu ook in het vaste assortiment, anders zou ik hem natuurlijk niet laten zien. En ja, heel erg mooi en daarbij kan je deze lipstick, pardon deze lipliner van P2 bijvoorbeeld combineren. Dus deze van Chanel. En het was de laatste lipstick, dus echt een zomerserood. Want rood kan natuurlijk het hele jaar door. Rood kan eigenlijk altijd, het is een hele tijdloze kleur. Het gaat eigenlijk nooit uit de mode. Is dit gewoon een hele mooie zomerservariant. En goed draagbaar, makkelijk aan te brengen. Dus als je ook rood wil, in de zomer is deze rode lipstick gewoon wel echt Ik wist dat je er een hele andere makeupsturie op zou nemen. Ik weet dat jullie daar geen zin in hebben om met het het heten weer de kans dat je echt helemaal vol makeup gaat. Klein is tenzij je mij bent.

Vergeet niet te abonneren hieronder. En dan zie ik je volgende keer weer. Tot de volgende keer. Doeg!","Today I will tell you about summer lips. I will show you some summer lip colors. I will show you how to apply it and I will give you tips on how to apply it. I have chosen some lip colors that are summery. A lot of them are a bit too much, like you are used to. I like a bit too much. But also a bit too much. You can choose what lipsticks you like. The colors are also very varied so you can choose what you want. Without lipstick, it feels a bit cold. And not everything is very clear, there are also calm shades between them. So let's start quickly. I've looked for lip colors, lipsticks, but also other liquid lip products. And what I think is important during the summer is that your lipstick stays long. Of course it does for the whole year, but now you know more. And then we can quickly look a bit shabby, sweat a bit and have everything. We don't want that. Well, that way I can definitely recommend you to wear a lip liner. I think it's very nice. And this one from Pi2. I bought this in Germany. And the lip liner is also very nice that you know where to put your lipstick. But if you include it very carefully, your lipstick will stay longer. First summer lipstick that I want to show you is this Stain Mud Lip Cream by Essence. This is Velvet Rose. And I'm going to do it right now. It's a liquid lip product, but it's very light. It's matte and very thick, so it's not lip gloss, it doesn't stick to your lips. It's very soft and it smells good. If you hear something or someone snores, that's weird. Very tired of the heat. This is a very nice matte, soft lip color. It's a bit different from lip gloss, but it's not too dark. It's not a very dark color, but it's very cute and well worn. I think it's a romantic look, something good for your summer. I think it's a nice soft lip color for the day, for your work, for your school. It's very wearable. So this is Essence. Oh yeah, if you remove your lip makeup, because you still have a different color on your skin, I use this neutral one. What I also do is sometimes use the foundation I used before, this one from H&M. A review will be on my blog, sometimes over my lips, so you can It's also very easy to change your skin tone. I'll put the light color on. I still get questions about how to apply it, but I don't think so. It's a very soft color, a bit more orange and a bit more than the previous color I saw from Essence. It's also very perfect. It's a very good thing that you can't really see the difference. You can see that they can be very good. And after that it's a little different color. Also a lot of summer colors, nice and red, no glitter. Glitter can be very good in summer, but I think that if you already have some glitters, like the highlighter or just because it's very warm and a little sweaty, then glitter might be too much. So then it's a matte color or a red color, because it's not really matte, but just red. Matte is one of the essence that I can show you. Then it's fine. I really like this one, this is the Mad about Pink I really like it, I apply it on my cheeks and it's really beautiful and what I always do is wear a neutral eye shadow with gold shades and a brown one matte brown colors and then I really like this one with a shiny blush, really good oh yeah and I like to apply lipstick, it might sound difficult but it's really a matter of practice at some point you just know how to apply your lips and how to apply them This lipstick is a bit more purple, I really like it. I love this lip color. It's matte too. The color is very nice and it was very good. It's lighter and softer. Still more safe, a bit more color. But we're going to go to the real color. But if you are in the fast-forwarded version, it is sold out because it is so popular. It is very fucsy, very cool. And I also put a lip liner underneath it. Because with the light colors, as I just showed you, they often look more beautiful and more elegant. While very bright colors like candy yum yum, often remain only with a little bit of orange. It often looks like you have a little snorkel, because on the top of your lips, say, there is still orange, because it never looks like orange. I think this is a classic red. Not a red, orange or a red. But a classic red. No, not classic. It's not classic. A summer red. It also has something of a coral look. I think this one is really nice together with... La Favorite. No, Le Cle Tante. This is La Favorite. Le Cle Tante. And yes, I have a terrible French pronunciation. Sorry for that. If you don't like it, you don't have to watch my videos. Because I'm really doing my best. But I just don't have it in me. I think this is a really nice color. So it's in the fast assortment, otherwise I wouldn't show it to you. Very nice and you can combine this lipstick, pardon this lip liner from P2. This one from Chanel. And that was the last lipstick, so really a summer red. Because red can go through the whole year. Red can always be a timeless color. It never goes out of fashion. Is this just a very nice summer variant? And well wearable, easy to wear. So if you also want red in the summer, this red lipstick is just really nice. This was my summer lipstick video. With tips, beautiful colors, how to apply it etc. I hope you liked it. It was something I wanted to try in a different video. It's really mega mega hot now. So I thought to take a full look at the makeup tutorial. I know you don't want to have it because you can't go full makeup with the hot weather. Small is the thing you are. I thought I would try the different types of lipsticks you have. It's not that hard to bring water. And give you simple make-up look. Right away an upgrade. It's a very nice product, especially for the summer. So that was my video. Thank you very much for watching. Don't forget to subscribe below. And I'll see you next time. See you next time. Bye!"

Let's cover again the three aspects of false judgment This is one of them living in someone's past remembering their past transgressions We know the other one is judging by appearance And we know the third one is judging based on what we surmise are their motives evil surmising Those are three forms of judgment You declare well they did this because those you think you know what that they motives are they show up Amen. Thank you all. by command he says be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful so it's not an option we're commanded to be merciful we're commanded to not live in the past to forgive to be helpful to be benevolent verse 37 judge not you should not be judged condemn not and you should not be condemned forgive And ye shall be forgiven. If you live in the past, well then God will live in your past. And as we read in Psalm 103, he has not yet rewarded us according to our iniquities. And then we must remember, if he brought up all our past, he said, okay, since you're due to the other people, I'll do it to you. We'd be quite miserable. We'd be quite miserable. But Lord, pray to the Lord, he doesn't do that. Amen. money, but it's talking about mercy here. It says, Give, and it shall be given unto you. Good men are oppressed out, shaken together, at running over shall men.","Praise the Lord church praise the Lord one is having a day in the Lord Turn to Micah Chapter 6 and as you're turning there some of you that may be a strange Look at you. Look at your indexes necessary. I'm gonna read you about 15 words and I want you to think about these words And I'm gonna ask you to give me back one word that encompasses all of these 15 Hear the words. Kindness, good, justice, consider, salvation, healing, deliverance, benevolence, loving kindness, helpful, righteous, truth, forgiveness, faithfulness, and compassion. What one word can you give me that encompasses all those 15. Jesus. Of course, Jesus. of what else? Of course God. But think of an aspect of God. Think of, we just read Psalm 103 and you get to actually set it right there. Mercy. Mercy. And therein is our title for today's message. Be Merciful. Be Merciful. In Micah chapter 6 verse 6 to 8 it reads, let me also insert, Brother David reminded us for the second time today, Or back? Verse 6, Verse 6, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8, Verse 8 Amen. I could take the time today and actually find scripture that shows out each of those words is a form of mercy. But I won't do that. I would just do with three of those words today. Specifically, we're going to deal with Hebrew starting in Hebrews 8. Forgiveness. We're going to deal with helpfulness. And we're going to deal with benevolence. Forgiveness, helpfulness, and benevolence. first with forgiveness. In Hebrews 8 verse 12, God is talking and he says, Amen. to not remember. Amen. Are you with them? Amen. So then for us to be followed by Christ, we too must choose to not remember yesterday's transgressions. Amen. We must choose to not remember yesterday's transgressions. We're going to Luke 6. You know, many people that I know who have gone through severe hurt and pain and so forth in their lives have chosen to ignore The problem I call it, you know, they call it sweetened the dust under the rug So the out of sight out of mind is still there Okay, and that's just so bothers them. It's just no longer part of that conscious thought but it's still fair and it's still bothers them And the person that brought the herd is mentioned or comes around it comes up from under the carpet And attacks like a cage But that's not what God is doing. He says he chooses to not remount. Amen Okay, and for us to be merciful first I say I follow God We must also choose to not remember to not live in the person's past Okay, now there's another name for living in the past What is it? Yes, so to the J judgment judgment When I live in someone's past I've judged her when I choose not to remember when I choose to remember their past I'm judging them recommends us to judge not for review let's cover again the three aspects of false judgment this is one of them living in someone's past remembering their past transgressions we know the other one is judging by appearance and we know the third one is judging based on what we surmise are their motives evil surmising those are the three forms of judgment you declare well they did this because those of you think you know what they're motives are they show up at Amen. Thank you all. by command, he says, be ye therefore merciful, as your father also is merciful. So it's not an option. We're commanded to be merciful. We're commanded to not live in the past, to forgive, to be helpful, to be benevolent. Verse 37, judge not. You shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive. And ye shall be forgiven. If you live in the past, well then God will live in your past. And as we read in Psalm 103, he has not yet rewarded us according to our iniquities.

I didn't like the power of the steam that I used before the bath. So I had to deal with the problem of the age of the bath. I had to deal with it every day. And finally, I was hit by the bath. I think that if you don't stay with Mr. Abe, Mr. Abe, and Mr. Eto-san, please come back to Eto-san. If you don't stay with Mr. Abe, you can't go down 20% of the internal revolution. That's why it's really been done as it is. And now, the second Abe-Nai-Kaku. I think that Mr. Abe will never get up again. When everyone thinks about it, Mr. Abe will always be a member of the party. The teacher Eto is a leader of the growth organization, but I don't know if it's true or not. However, no matter where the position is, Eto's teacher is a good person for Abe. He is a good person for Abe. He is a good person for Abe. Mr. Eto is saying that when no one believes in the theory of the debate, Mr. Eto is the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the I'm a friend of Abe, who is a part of the Masukomi family. But in terms of social direction, Abe and Eto-san are from the first time in the first round of the Touzen series. Abe was thinking about the welfare from the time. The problem of wealth is important, but if you don't think about it with welfare, you won't be able to feel secure in Japan. He is a politician who has been able to support himself with confidence, so I would like to ask him to support us for the next two days."

Все подробности далее. Линды ратируются на греческом FM и подолгу держатся на вершинах хит-парадов. К тому же певица уже отсняла несколько клипов Греции и даже встретила там Новый год. Теперь в ближайших планах певицы переехать в страну окончательно и выйти замуж за Грека. И возможно, будущим мужем Линды станет ее новый продюсер Стефана Скарколес. Человек, подаривший певицы не только новый мир, но и новые дыхания. Похоже, Линда нашла вторую родину. график певицы пестрит экзотическими греческими городами. Греция или может быть грек, новая любовь Линды. Концерт в городе Ларнат прошел с полным отшлагом, впрочем, так и в других греческих залах. И не случайных. Новый альбом Линды Алиада наполнен греческими инструментами, которые привнесли в звучание диска среди земноморских колорит и энергетик.","Our Russian Lindo's Varana seemed to be in a warm place and almost already shone in the middle of the Varnaque. All the details are in the next. Linda is rated by the Greek FM and for a long time has the highest hits. In addition, the singer has already taken a few clips of Greece and even met there a new year. Now, in the nearest plans of the singer, to move to the country is final and to get married to Greece. And perhaps the future husband of Linda will become her new producer, Stefano Scorcolis. A person who gave the singer not only a new world, but also a new breath. It seems, Linda found a second homeland. The schedule of the singer is a pestrite with exotic Greek cities. Greece or maybe Greece is a new love of lindes. The concert in the city of Larnat went with a full swing. However, both in other Greek halls and not by chance. The new album of the lindes of Aliado is filled with Greek instruments, which brought the sound of a disco among the earthenware color and energy."

Welcome to the woman who has been with Columbus. Thank you. You are Lizanne, tell us a little bit about your work here on Columbus TV. Well, I have been in Columbus since 2001 approximately. At the moment I am director of operations of the Mexican Alps, of the TV, and will soon launch a new network called Mundo Fox, which has been And has it been a success? It has been a success, it has been hard, but it is a matter of work and work only takes a lot of perseverance and when we work together, we join, then these are the results. You talk about union, diversity, Spanish community that you feel, that it is diverse, that you feel that it is the secret of success. The secret of success I think is in support, but more than support, I think it is that there is always a life that is lost The idea of Fox Superhead is that 14% of the American population is Spanish. The advertising that is being spent is only 4% of the total budget. It is unbalanced in its distribution. That's why Fox World now brings a difference not only in marketing but also in programming. We have a partnership with people from RSN, which is the Colombian channel, and we can teach, see how the capital, the simsons, are also brought by us. So Fox, from the beginning, is in the 70% of the Spanish market. One of the things I found as a means of communication is that most of the of the corporations, they only trust the traditional media and they don't see beyond the media of the community, the social media. What do you feel about that? And another thing is that there is so much local content, the content of the United States, but many companies, as they are going to have content in other countries to obtain content. What do you think of that? Well, what happens is that there is a huge potential that has not been exploited here. I think that many companies opt for traditional media because First of all, they always have the budget, but they don't have the mentality to adapt to the Spanish market. They can have the money, but at the same time they make the investment, they don't have a department that is in charge of ordinarily managing a strategy to bring that market. They also have to be confident, they don't want to be confident. Of course, in a way, so what they pay for that, they don't see a return result, they are afraid to continue to lose and try new means because they stay with the traditional to spend the budget that has usually been without anything. and we have experienced it as social media. Social media has changed everything. What do you feel like you are in the part of television? What has influenced social media to the changes? What are you going through? Social media, more than everything, has been quite in the market, really, in the market, but a little more. But since then, it has been a innovation and it brings us more alternatives to reach the population. without any doubt, it's not a traditional thing, it's a TV show, but we use it on the internet, Facebook, Twitter to add some content. You're going to go to the police station? If God wants, we'll be in charge of everything. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're on the edge. Goodbye."

Questão lógica, os prejuízos são inúmeros e a situação está cada vez pior. Nós temos hoje um material tudo empilhado aqui, sendo pescador sem fazer nada. O defeso foi recebido já em mês de março, parece março e abril. E agora que chega a safra da taína, nós não podemos pescar. De acordo com a previsão do IBAMA, uma resolução será encaminhada até o próximo dia 20 de maio. Por aqui, a espera torna-se mais longa pela situação de penúria de muitos dos pescadores. Impedidos de pescar, até mesmo a taíne em plena temporada, resta contar os dias, já que com seus materiais guardados, sem poder ir ao mar, as dificuldades estão chegando até mesmo na mesa dos pescadores. aí o que é que vai fazer? quem está sabendo que o pescador está comendo, se a profissão dele é só peste, hoje você veja aí todos os material que a gente tem está empilhado, se não tiver providência o que é que vai acontecer com o pescador? vai perder tudo, vai botar fora porque não tem validade, vai estragando porque vai ficando parado, o pescador não está usando e está estragando todos os material, né?","In just over 30 days, Ibanma has collected fishing materials, like nets, dozens of fishers from the Silver Rice. The issue is logical, the losses are in numbers and the situation is getting worse and worse. We have today all the material here, being fishers without doing anything. The defense has been received already in March and April. And now that the Tainha safra arrives, we can't fish. According to the IBAMA forecast, the resolution will be set until May 20. Here, the wait becomes longer due to the situation of the penalty of many fishermen. In order to fish, even the taiga, in the middle of the season, remains to be counted the days, since with its materials stored, without being able to go to the sea, the difficulties are reaching even the fishers' table. What will you do? Who is knowing that the fisherman is eating? If his profession is only fishing, today you see all the materials that we have, it's impaled. If there is no providence, what will happen to the fisherman? He will lose everything, he will put it out because there is no validity, he will spoil, because he will be stopped, the fisherman is not using it, and he is spoiling all the materials."

Isso é um dia que você vai ouvir o Espírito Esparra, um e para todos. Quando lhe podemos chegar até Jesus, se não podemos, o homem rei de novo, já o homem é vivido, o homem é velho, o homem conhece todas as escrituras da lei, conhece todos os mandamentos, Ele era uma oportunidade eclesiástica, ele era uma oportunidade religiosa onde ele está. Ele era um dos cabeças. E ele, de uma certa forma escondido, foi atrapalho o Senhor Jesus a noite. E começa a enogiar Jesus, não, porque ninguém faz o que o Senhor pode fazer, se não fosse por Deus e etc. Jesus simplesmente vira para ele e diz... Então olha, pessoas juntos, se alguém não nascer, De novo. O que nós entendemos por isso? O que que é que você podemos tirar? Como nascer de novo. Uma pessoa ela tá... Andando numa rua e de repente um cameão atropela ela. Lógico que ela se ferra, ela se arranha. Não quer abatar. Ela não susto, se machuca o corpo. E o que ela diz depois... Ela olha o caminho, o caminho, o caminho carrega, atropelou ela. Ela se ralga um pouco, não quebrou nada. Nada mais grato que alguns arremantes. Ela pariu e falou, eu nasci de novo. Eu tive uma segunda chance. A criança aprende a andar, a cantar, a andar. A criança vai crescendo e ela vai aprendendo. Assim é aquele que está diante de Deus. Tem que literalmente voltar a ser como uma criança. Tem que voltar e começar tudo de novo. Começar com um bebê no vento e materna. Em poucas palavras, tem que ter a sua segunda chance diante de Deus. Ou talvez a terceira, a quarta, a quarta, que eu não sei, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada, Deus tem dada e vai nascer de novo? Olha a resposta de Jesus. Por favor recebam sim. Respondem Jesus. Eu não quero inferno, eu não quero lá de volta e chofe, eu quero ser jovem a vida eterna, eu quero entrar, eu quero ager os adem, então você precisa nascer da água, você precisa ser repreendendo seus pecados. Posso ser assim, eu já já sei por termo. Não toque pra por dúvida no seu coração, creio, você creio no seu batido, você sepultou a velha criatura, creio. Maravilha, graças a Deus, então você é uma nova criatura. Agora você precisa nascer de Deus. você precisa nascer de novo. E o que é o nascer de novo? É você tomar consciência completa do que é o pecado. É você abominar o mundo. É você abominar o pecado, né? Você está ali. Muita gente, ela pode entrar aqui. Mas a pessoa que hoje ela está aqui amanhã ela está no Sena-Onta, a pouco ela está no Sena-Onto, ela está no... que ela nunca vai encontrar. Em uma profetiza, ela está buscando no Sacerdote, ela está buscando no... ela está buscando... e ela não vai achar. porque o que Jesus tem pra dar pra você é uma nova vida não é um pachô, um bicho, um apóstolo, um opreiro, o que quer que seja, que vai dar pra você essa vida nova essa vida nova só vem quando você realmente se entregue de corpo, alma e espírito ao ser o Jesus o que é nascido do Espírito é Espírito mas o que é nascido da carne cara, o que eu entendo por isso? Seja quem for, está linda por o reino de Deus, a linda bem vó. Mas se pulando também assim, como a rochona, o cenário, pulando, não sei. Nascer de novo não é uma coisa indivídua. O marido nasce de Deus, você tem que buscar. Porém, é só que você tem que buscar muitas vezes uma resposta, um milagre. O novo lançamento lembra? Torra, luta e dificuldade. Tudo isso vai acabar atrás. Tudo isso vai acabar atrás. Os momentos difíceis vão ficar para trás, as lutas vão ficar para trás. Se o teu sacrifício seria perfeito, nós sabemos que não. Nós sabemos que não. Mas Jesus morreu por você. Para que eu e você pudéssemos ter a oportunidade de nascer de novo, de poder entrar no reino de Deus. Não se desespera. Às vezes você fica ansioso de desesperar para dar de um problema. Você tinha que estar preocupado. Se Jesus voltasse, você você morresse. momento para um que Deus varga. Se o seu coração tem andado ansioso, se o seu coração tem andado contrido, abatido, escute, você precisa nascer de Deus. Não que você não vá prosperar, não que você não vá ser feliz, não que você não vá ter uma família de Deus Vada. Claro, tudo isso é vindô do abenço de Deus. Mas tudo isso vai chegar um momento que vai chegar ao fim. Você precisa nascer de novo. Você precisa abraçar a oportunidade que Deus está dando para você.","Jesus, in truth and in truth I tell you that if someone is not born again, he cannot see the Kingdom. This is a matter of listening to the Spirit, to spread it to everyone. When we reach the Kingdom, we can give them a different name, a different name, a different name, a name that knows all the scriptures and laws, knows all the commandments, He was an ecclesiastical authority, he was a religious authority, where he was, he was one of the leaders. And he, in a certain way, was hidden, was the Lord Jesus' father, at night, and begins to praise Jesus, not because nobody does what the Lord can do, but because he was a God, etc. Jesus simply turns to him and says, look, people together, if someone does not give birth, Again. What do we understand about this? What do we see that we can take off with the birth again? A person is walking on a street and suddenly a truck approaches her. Of course, she gets lost, she gets hurt, she doesn't want to go to the bathroom. She's scared, she gets hurt, and what she says is that she's on her way, she's on her way, she's carrying the truck, she's touched her, she's shaking a little bit, she's not broken anything, nothing more serious than some tears. She stops her eyes and says, I was born again. I had a second chance. Being born again is having a new beginning. Being born again is starting again. It's starting from zero. This is how it is. The mother creates the child. The child is born. The child learns to feed. The child learns to be born. The child learns to walk, to walk, to walk. The child, she will grow up and she will learn. This is what is in front of God. You have to literally come back to be like a child. You have to come back and start everything again. Start with a living, living, living, living. In a few words. You have your second chance in front of God. Or maybe the third, fourth, here I don't know. Hold your breath. God has the identity, God has the identity within us, God has the identity of humanity and opportunities. How many? I don't know what the limit of God for each person, I don't know what the patience of God for me or for you, I don't know how long God will say Satan will touch him, I don't know what else to do, I'm giving you another opportunity, you will give me what you are, God is telling you, I'm giving you another opportunity, Look, if you have a certain desire, you must be born again. God says you need to start over. You need a new heart. You need a new life. You need to start over. You need to be born again. I have a question in your heart. How can I be born again? We can do the same thing. I ask. How can a man be an old man? I want to be born again. And will I be born again? Look at the response of Jesus. Please receive the message. Answer Jesus. Truth and truth of God. Who does not give birth to water and the Spirit? What is born of the Spirit? What? Spirit. If you say, I want to be saved. I want to enter the Kingdom of God. I want to be the one who knows the truth. I don't want hell, I don't want to go back to the choffer, I want to live the eternal life, I want to enter, I want to be a virgin, so you need to be born of the water, you need to understand your sins, I was born, I have already accepted it, I don't touch any doubt in your heart, you believe in your baptism, you have accepted the old creature, believe, wonderful, thanks to God, so you are a new creature, now you need to be born of God, You need to be born again. And what is being born again? You are taking complete consciousness of what is sin. You are abominating the world. You are abominating sin. You are in it. Many people are thinking that today she is here, tomorrow she is in Sena-Onta, soon she is in Sena-Onta, she is in the ... she will never find it. In a prophetess, she is looking for a priest, she is looking for ... she is looking for ... and she will never find it. Because what Jesus has to give to you is a new life. It is not a Easter, a bishop, a apostle, a worker, or whatever it is, that will give you this new life. This new life only comes when you really surrender yourself to the soul and spirit of Jesus. What is born from the Spirit is Spirit. But what is born from the flesh, man? What do I understand about that? Jesus carried the DNA of God, the Holy Spirit, as Jesus Christ here on earth, He did not carry the genes of Mary or Joseph. Jesus carried the DNA of God, the Holy Spirit, on him. Why did Jesus give Mary the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit was the one who created the people of Jesus, the Lord of Mary. Jesus was created by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was born from the Spirit. You have to understand what God is offering you. It is eternal. It is new life. It is a new heart. You can't worry about something. If your neighbor, if your neighbor, if your husband, your wife, Be it a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire, or a fire The difficult moments will be back. The struggles will be back. Think about it. If it were you and me, if your sacrifice would be perfect, we would know if not. We know if not, but Jesus died for you. So that I and you could have the opportunity to be born again, to be able to enter the kingdom of God. Do not despair, sometimes you get anxious, despair, no problem. You have to be worried. If Jesus came back, if you died, for a moment for a new one. If your heart has walked with the Spirit, if your heart has walked with the Spirit, listen, you need to be born from God. You will not prosper, you will not be happy, you will not have a new family. Of course, all this is the gift of the thought of God. But all this will come at the end. You need to be born again. You need to embrace the opportunities that God has given you."

If we make such a production that gives it as a whole the possibilities that it has to choose, in terms of production, something from a certain level of possibility, maybe that, and in our world it is not found. We are talking about all the issues. Everyone says that we are in the midst of all the issues in our race, the selfish ones. That all our concerns are only how to find better, better, more effective, more... that we are more likely to have. And so our race is our race, and so our goal is to lead the race, which is to make all the rest of the race, and help us to achieve what we want, energy in less problems and in a more specific way. And if we are in this world, then, that is to say, in this land, we have no choice. We always enter the same community where it is better. Therefore, we do not separate from the mind or the mind or the life. Only our communities are more than the same. The wisdom you are getting is saying, when will it start to be and I think that the man, from this idea that we call the man, who begins to feel a desire for spiritual power, outside of this world, to a different kind. So, between two types of the body that suddenly feel a desire for this world, to be able to interact with something that is in this world, and suddenly there is a desire for something that is not known, and the people feel it, yes, all the seeds and the essence and everything that is now in the world, the seeds of something that is beyond life, but they still don't get the result. So, what do you mean by saying that in a moment that there are already two directions to this person, and they have a chance? What to do with the situation? Just in this way. And also in this, you don't have to choose what to choose, what to choose, or you can choose your name."

I was looking at log x near one because to start off with I knew something about log one. Okay, I knew that log one equals to zero and hence I could move forward. Okay. Now I can always change my base point. My base point here was x naught which equals to 1. Now I want to probably check it at another base point. Now what would that base point be? What would that base point be? Where I could check you know natural log function itself. Checking log x checking natural log x at x not equals to 1 gave me the following approximation, gave us the following approximation which was log x equals to x minus 1 around 0 ok. Log x equals to x minus 1 around 0. Now taking this x minus 1 as some number y ok, taking this x minus 1 as some variable or number called y ok. So, That means x becomes y plus 1 x becomes y plus 1 Earlier my base point was 1 Earlier my base point was 1 Now what I can do is I can take a new base point y to be 0 and check accordingly and check accordingly and it will be almost same like checking at the base point 1 which will give me the previous base point point x equals to 1 because y I am put taking as a base point which equals to 0. Okay, let me just tell you it this way. So in case I take y, y equals to x minus 1 and y minus 1 will become x. So that means that you know natural log y natural log y x will become sorry y plus 1 so natural log y plus 1 will equal to y can you see that is the same thing as writing let me just change the color ln x equals to x minus 1 what I have done is in place of x I have written y plus 1 and in place of x minus 1 I have written y so now Now I can change my base point and I can change my base point to 0 resulting in the same thing. So I just change the function. So what I've done is we've just shifted things. We've just shifted things by one. We've just shifted things by one. That is it. That's all I'm doing. In the domain I'm shifting things by one and hence I'm getting a new functional value approximation. Okay.

So now function is instead of log x it is log 1 plus x. So f dash will be 1 upon 1 plus x, f 0 will be log of 1 which is 0 and f dash x will be 1 upon f dash x will be 1 upon 1 which is 1 so my approximation will be ln 1 plus x is approximately not exactly equal it should be approximately equal to f 0 plus f dash 0 x correct so that is equal to 0 plus 1 into x which is x. So conceptually here I just told you how you can shift things and mathematically you just see how exactly you get the same thing.","Previously we have seen log log x as a function natural log okay log x as a function and we saw the linear approximation of log x at x not equal to one near one and why did I do that I was looking at log x near one because to start off with I knew something about log one okay I knew that log one equals to zero and hence I could move forward.

Thanks for coming in. And so what do you think is this a hurdle that has finally been crossed by global crossing? Well sure the great thing about chapter 11 is that in order to emerge from it you have to you have to face some serious decisions and make some some definite changes to the business structure. What global crossing is coming out with now is a much better debt position, significantly reduced operational expenses, which is great for them. And also this new ownership, if it comes through, which I expect it will, with Hutchison and ST Telemedia, puts them in a much better position. What do you think Hutch and ST Telemedia really bring to the table? Well, they bring a lot of experience in Asia. They bring a solid management structure. And at this point, it appears that they will emerge as owners, not necessarily owners and certainly a significant role in the management of the company, but not actually taking over global crossings existing network at any level. But the synergies between the companies are great. Now global crossing obviously has all of its own problems, but one of the key problems for the industry has been the over capacity and the competition. Just the weariness in general towards the telecom industry. How, really, what can it do at this point in order to try to tackle those issues as well? Overcapacity is definitely an issue. I see though often when it's reported as overcapacity and weak demand and that really is not the case. What's occurring in the market is that the people, the companies that buy the capacity that global crossing sells are hesitant to buy. There's a lot of instability in the marketplace right now. One of the things that's going to help global crossing a lot is for not only them but other companies who have gone into Chapter 11 to emerge from it and start hopefully more emerge than in the future go into Chapter 11 and start to build and stability back into the market just in general. So I do think that at that point the service providers will start to purchase capacity again, which will maybe not affect the over capacity on some routes, but it will certainly stop those from saying that there is no demand. And that brings about a lot of much more calm attitude for companies such as Global Crossing as well. All right, thank you very much. You sound actually rather optimistic about it. I really am. I know that there's demand out there in the marketplace. That's a positive thing. And I think that global crossing really has done the right things to emerge well. I think they'll suffer from a bit of a tarnished reputation in the short term. But I think that they can overcome that. And I think Hatch and STT will help them to do that.

Pode ser um clipe de música, pode ser um filme, um jingle e nesse caso é um vídeo publicitário. Eu vi durante o Carnaval, achei muito interessante a forma como ele falava do próximo vídeo. eu queria compartilhar algumas ideias com vocês então primeiro passo vinda depois eu digo as características e vou comentando acho que seria mais legal até para entender melhor o que eu digo então girl blotex para vocês 37% das pessoas que usam aprovam vale a pena experimentar se você gosta de sexo você gosta de sexo não gosta é jovem o vídeo é bom o vídeo é legal foi feito pela pd foi feito pela pd comunicação de comunicação foi feito pela pra campanha isso muda tudo que é a blotete lançando a skin que é a nova camisinha Adoro sexo, eu dei o camisinha mas essa camisinha feita de maneira diferente quer dizer ela pega o produto que é o texisquim e já leva já diferencia já segmenta diz que a camisinha já diferente das outras quer dizer já é um produto diferenciado especial até interessante convencional nada mais natural do que o anúncio dizer Não me pergunte os detalhes é diferente, ela diz que é um produto diferente, mas os detalhes não tornei a ele. não dá muita ênfase quer dizer esse clouso no roxo dela que parece que é uma conversa intimista então parece que ela é íntima sua então nesse momento ela está recomendando um algo que ela acha melhor que ela acha diferente é uma camisinha que é diferente que ela não sabe mais ou menos o que é mas também não importa é bom eu uso uso e também o interessante disso não é nem esse argumento e si mas a forma leve como esse é passado uma mulher que tem uns traços leves então pode ser uma mulher pode ser também uma menina que conhece com essa conversa natural atrai, cativa as mulheres ao mesmo tempo essa autoridade que ela conversa, a normalidade que ela conversa sobre sexo e suas roupas mínimas, claro também atrai os homens esse jogo muito cativante, muito sagaz que o publicitário diretou quem criou isso fez que tanto chama a atenção do homem chama a atenção da mulher, desse jeito simples é notório eu adorei, achei muito bom mesmo com as estatísticas não se importa muito com a fidelidade de informação, só que a ideia de que a maioria usa e que é diferente. Esse alunço também ele se baseia muito na questão Tati. Essa cena por exemplo perceba a todo momento ela está tocando no proper rules, nasci no interior a essa, ela está embaixo do Edredon quer dizer ela passa essa ideia do Tati muito bem elaborada, muito bem delicada Vale a pena experimentar aqui. E não se esqueça de que você é um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo, um grande amigo você sente um certo sotaque na voz da atriz que é muito difícil nas propagandas você vê que a propaganda as pessoas falam o sotaque com a voz imposta com a voz ela não fala com um certo sotaque com uma coisa sensual mas tudo bem leve bem diminuto e isso meio que passa para o skin para o produto quer dizer se fala muito pouco de sexo tanto é nenhum anúncio fala 3 vezes sexo envolve mais a sensualidade envolve mais a coisa total e os homens dos ficar curiosos porque eu vi o desse forma natural da mulher tratar de sexo, a sensualidade mas não é a mulher fruta, não é desacervada isso tratou muito bem o que é o produto, no caso, se o problema foi isso, pelo menos essa gama de desce é ideal para quem gosta de sexo então é isso galera, foi o meu primeiro vídeo sobre a musica publicidade sobre criatividade viram outros qualquer coisa com as fitarecentes diferente pode ser música filme seriado a se diferente achei criativo vou comentar e botando o vídeo esse aí Chico Martins abraço até a próxima","Hello people, my name is Chico Martins and as I said earlier, I will make a few videos that I think are interesting, that go beyond the idea of creativity, everything that involves creativity. It can be a music video, it can be a movie, a jingle, and in this case it is a public video. I saw during Carnival, I found it very interesting the way he talks about the product, I wanted to share some ideas with you So first I'll go through the video, then I'll tell the characteristics and I'll comment I think it would be nicer to understand better what I say So, go, Blu-tex for you I've been dancing for 6 months, but I saw during the carnival, an insertion of the Samba, Bilal, Anus and Carnival, so I thought it was very interesting, the way he treats things. So I'm commenting and I'm going to go through a little bit, while I show, I speak to be more dynamic. in a weird shirt announcement, a paradoxic break, but you understand it. But this shirt made differently means it takes the product that is the blue tech skin and already makes a difference, already segments, says that the shirt is already different from the others, that is, it is already a special differentiated product. Even the conventional interesting, nothing more natural than the announcement, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is, It's a different product, but the details are different. It's not very good to make this close on her face that seems to be an intimate conversation. So it seems that she is intimate with you. So at this moment she is recommending something that she thinks better, that she thinks differently. It's a little shirt that is different, that she doesn't know more or less what it is, but it doesn't matter, it's good. I use it, I use it too. The interesting thing about this is not even this argument itself, but the light way it's passed. a woman who has a light traits so it can be a woman, it can also be a girl who, with this natural conversation attracts and catapults women at the same time this authority that she talks, this normality that she talks about sex and her clothes of course also attracts men this very cativating game very savage that the director published who created it The fact that so much people call the attention of men and women, this simple bait is notary. I loved it, I think it's very good. Another fantastic moment, it's not fantastic, but it's very different. She says that she heard say that 97% of people approve the shirt. She heard saying that 97% approved. It's an intimate conversation. It's a person who wants to pass the product. And at the same time, she doesn't get the statistics, doesn't get the research, doesn't get the fidelity of the argument. The advertising team had courage and also had the perception, maybe he believes that the fan public who uses this kind of shirt doesn't really care. with the statistics does not really matter with the fidelity of information, but the idea that most use and that is different. This news also, it is based a lot on the Tati issue. This scene for example, I realize at all times she is playing in the same place, in the previous scene she is under the Edredon, she passes this Tati idea very well elaborated, very well delicate, that has everything to do with the product, which is called Skin, Skin, Skin, Skin English. It is worth experimenting. It is worth experimenting if you like sex. I mean, it is to talk to the audience, use what you like about sex, if it will allow you to have a new shirt, I mean, the whole audience is inviting and the final card comes and kills. You like sex. You like sex, you don't like it, I mean, the phrases she uses for the word sex, I was impressed with her naturalness, she uses sex, it does not bring pleasure, it does not bring sensuality, she has this natural sensuality, she transbordes her life to the doctor, which is in her room, in her clothes, but rolling around in the bed with a direct look in her life, but it is a natural thing, a tragedy, but she knows how to translate this simplicity, this natural thing. You feel a certain accent in the voice of the actress. It's very difficult in propaganda. You see that the propaganda, people say that they have an accent with the voice of the impostor, with the voice of the actress. She doesn't speak with an accent with a sexual thing, but with a very light, very low voice. And this kind of thing that goes to the skin, to the product. That is, you speak very little about sex. So much so that in the announcement you speak 3 times about sex. It involves more sensuality, it involves more the whole thing. I think it's very important to have a good relationship with your ex, and to have a good relationship with your ex. about creativity, they become others, anything with interesting and different, it can be music, serious film, I think it's different, I thought it was creative, I'll comment and put it in the video. That's it, Chico Martins, hug and see you next time."

I think what I'd like to see pressed forward is a plan that takes X amount of new revenue, puts it into some type of a fund where we can draw off that fund or the interest off that fund pays down some of the debt service on that.

The pain resulting from these injuries can last a lifetime and affect construction workers' lives at work and at home. But these injuries can be prevented. The video will also show what employers must do so that the work can be done more safely. Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe workplace and required protective equipment. You'll see that taking the right protective steps can help prevent these injuries. An experienced stone mason and her tender were using large stone pieces to build a walkway for a new two-story townhome. A concrete slab was already in place and the work was done safely. The workers were putting the stone on top of the slab. The tender was mixing the mortar in five gallon buckets and carrying the mortar to the mason. After the mason spread some of the mortar onto the concrete slab, the workers bent over at the waist to pick up one of the heavy stone pieces. They kneeled down and hunched over to lay the stone piece on top of the mortar. After several days of carrying these heavy loads and kneeling and hunching while doing their work, both of these workers are experiencing severe lower back and knee pain. Let's look at the events leading up to these injuries and see how they could have been prevented. As before, the tender is mixing mortar. This time a cement mixer is being used and the tender wheels the mortar over to the stone mason. The stone pieces have also been placed off the ground and both workers are now wearing knee pads. After the mason spreads some of the mortar, the workers pick up and lay one of the stone pieces into the wet mortar. Making these types of small changes in work activities can prevent painful injuries. This example shows the importance of employers using OSHA's ergonomics guidelines.

My name is Jasmine Rosa. I currently attend the University of Central Florida majoring in Business Administration with a minor in nonprofit organization. I would like to take this time and give a special thank you to my sponsor MasterCard. I'd like to share a little story about me. It was Ash Wednesday in 2001. I was home watching TV and having dinner in my grandmother's bedroom. And then it came. It was a police. Confused, my grandmother opened the door. It was two policemen and a woman from child services. I would never forget that day, when my grandmother put up a courageous fight. I was only 10 years old and I was put into the New York City child services system because of my parents drug addiction. My younger sister Christina was nine years old and my little brother Nicholas was six years old. The other children in the farm The foster center were much older than us.

I would like to take this time and give a special thank you to my sponsor MasterCard. I'd like to share a little story about me. It was Ash Wednesday in 2001. I was home watching TV and having dinner in my grandmother's bedroom. And then it came. It was a police. Confused, my grandmother opened the door. It was two policemen and a woman from child services. I would never forget that day, when my grandmother put up a courageous fight. I was only 10 years old and I was put into the New York City child services system because of my parents drug addiction. My younger sister Christina was nine years old and my little brother Nicholas was six years old. The other children in the fall The foster center were much older than us. They were also very angry at the world. Drug use was rampant and most of them had been in juvenile detention or juvie. And many of the girls already had babies.

Auch für die Rettungskräfte ist das ein Rätsel. An Spekulationen mag man sich jedenfalls nicht beteiligen. Wir merken nur, dass die Einsatzhäufigkeit jetzt groß ist. Die große Frage nach den Gründen für die Unfallhäufung bleibt also zunächst unbeantwortet. Sicher ist nur, dass zumindest die Baustelle irgendwann wieder verschwinden wird.

A young Opel driver from Middle-Hessen has come off the road, has been beaten several times and has finally landed on the roof in the ditch. The balance of the shock, a heavy injury, about 10,000 euros total damage to the vehicle and a 5 km long backstab. Accident, even completely unclear. The firemen have made the first aid to the service of the rescue. The cyclists have given the driver a heavy injury to the rescue service and as always, the fire protection is secured and of course the accident is secured. Of course accidents happen, but normally not so often in such a short time on a such manageable route. The total damage goes into the millions and not less motorists, especially the pendants, who are on the road to the storm times every day on the road between Frankfurt and Friedberg, are asked where it is likely that it is constantly being scrapped. Even for the rescue forces, the device is a speculation. You can't participate in speculations. We only notice that the use is now large. We have a lot of people who are not in the hospital. The big question remains unanswered after the reasons for the accident. will disappear again. For example, in mid-December the work on the railway should be completed."

I just send a very clear message to the dealers, do not challenge us because we are not going to help people immediately, anyone or anyone Any truck, unit that reports me, or the same citizens that denies me, we will remove their concession and if they continue to threaten the authority, as well as we decree to increase the rate, I will decree to lower the rate, that the concessionaries do not threaten us because they will not find any support in the government in the state, attending to people, giving good services as they will have the support of the government in the state. and do not let that happen and if it happens that please denounce them my position is very energetic and final I will not allow it and do not challenge the government because it will not shake our hand in trying to cancel their concessions and deliver new concessions to those who do want to give a good service to the city. The honorary commander reiterated that he will withdraw the concessions to the transporters who charge the complete fee because he remembered that the only faculty authority in to define this rubro is the government of the state.

It was responsible for about 50,000, actually over 50,000 deaths last year in 2012. And the interesting thing about this cancer is that we can prevent the cancer through screening and other modalities of treatment and prevention. And our interest in this study was to understand the extent to which colonoscopy, which is now the most commonly used screening test, could prevent the risk of diagnosis advanced colorectal cancers. Now, why are we interested in this topic, specifically advanced colorectal cancers? Because these are the cancers that result in death, primarily. Now, screening tests should be able to prevent cancers or detect them at an earlier, more treatable phase. And so we were interested in finding out if colonoscopy does prevent the risk of diagnosis with advanced colorectal cancers in average risk populations. Now, the average risk populations were studied who have not had any of the traditional risk factors of colorectal cancer, such as apollop or a very strong family history of having colorectal cancers. This was a relatively challenging study for us to conduct. For one, we received funding from the government under the ARRA mechanism to conduct the study and those funding streams were only provided for about two years. And so the timeline was very short to conduct this very extensive study, but that was not the main challenge. And like this, an observational study of colorectal cancer screening, we needed to be sure that we knew the reason why the tests were done. Colonoscopy was used for many years for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, and that is for symptoms or conditions that the doctor felt could be associated with colorectal cancer or that illness is in gastrointestinal tract. And the use of screening colonoscopy is a relatively recent use of the test. that when we say a test was for screening, that indeed it was for screening. The reason for that is that if we misclassify or put screening tests, diagnostic tests for screening, the chances that the results that we obtain will not be valid. And this has been the issue with some of the studies that have been done in the past and wanted to be sure that we address these specific concerns that have been raised in the past about studies like this. So in our study, we went to the medical records, which are imperfect but does provide information about the intent of the referral, and we provided as much information as we got to an expert group who would then review the information and determine if a test was for screening. This was really a very important part of the study. And now for a study like this, we had several centers that were involved, and those centers made it possible for us to detect people, identify people who had colorectal cancer, through electronic medical records and other sources of data in the healthcare systems. The findings from our study should be important to a wide spectrum of people from clinicians who provide advice about screening to patients that in the eligible age to patients who are trying to make decisions about colorectal cancer screening. It is also important for people who are making decisions about providing services for screening, those that lead programs for colorectal cancer screening, policy leaders and other people who are involved in research in the area of colorectal cancer screening. screening. Because our study does provide answers that to date have not been quite clear. We found in this study that the use of colonoscopy for screening in average risk persons reduced the risk of diagnosis with advanced colorectal cancers by about 70% overall. And on the right side, which is really where the questions have lingered, we found that it seems to be effective by about which is quite interesting and we're quite surprised by that level of efficacy, knowing that previous studies have questioned whether colonoscopy does work on the right side of the colon. And this is also important because the right side of the colon is where the colonoscopy has an advantage over sigmatoscopy. Sigmatoscopy only reaches to the left side of the colon, colonoscopy can reach to the right, and so that advantage has not been proven to be the case. And this study does suggest that that is the case. This is a very important study, but the more important question that we need to answer is whether or not colonoscopy reduces the risk of dying from colorectal cancer when it's used for screening in general population. And that's a much more important question for us to answer in the future. There are clinical trials, randomized trials that are going on in this country and in Europe addressing this question. that have been conducted to answer this question. Now, one of the other questions that we also need to answer is whether colonoscopy is the right test for everyone, and that may not be the case. And so these are also important questions that we need to answer through research studies. And the other important question that we also need to answer is the extent to which colonoscopy is it equivalent or better as the screening test than other screening tests that I use. And these include stigmatoscopy and that the test force stool that's also available in this country.","Colorectal cancer is one of the most important cancers we face in this country.

Själva skargången i den här gruppen handlar väldigt mycket om att peka finger på vilka som är problemet. Att få skylla saker och ting som är fel i samhället, världen eller i min tillvaro på någon annan kan vara ganska bekvämt. Att man dessutom rödes ute på stan tillsammans som grupp med uppgift att provocera frambråk kunde vara världens bästa tillfälle för mig att få ge igen genom att aktivt slåss och ge mig på andra. Ofta hamnade vi i sitt varande –där vi provocerade fram konflikter. Det var inte alltid det ledde till våld. Det avslutades ofta i höggjorda hot, bråk och skrik och annat.

Alltifrån sådana som man kanske hade suttit och diskuterat– –att det var dags att ge sig på redan innan– till rent spontant vilka man stötter på när man väl var ute, vilka situationer man hamnade i.

The self-sacrifice in this group is a lot about picking up fingers on which problems are. And just to sit down and talk about which problems are The fact that I can distinguish things that are wrong in society, the world or in my presence, can be quite comfortable. That one of these things was moved out of the city together as a group. With the intention of provoking violence, it could be the best case for me to actually get the idea back, through the act of beating and giving me on to others. where we provoked conflicts. It was not always led to violence. It was often decided in high-ranking threats, threats and so on. But not quite so. To go to the city in a common sense, it was also possible that you would find a kind of goal. That the media provoked threats.

I'm here with APD Board Director Lisa Sladen. You're also on the Vision Task Force and one of the things that happened today in the House of Delegates was the adoption of a new vision. So first of all, what was that vision? Transforming society by optimizing movement to improve the human experience. So that's not familiar to now, but it will be familiar to. It's much shorter the Vision 2020, even the statement by itself. As many in the delegates noted today, you can fit it on a t-shirt. One of the common themes of Reactions of Delegates the vision statement as you've been going through this process is that their first reaction was that it seemed really bold and big and then over time they warmed to it. Can you kind of describe that and also the boldness of the vision? So we recognize that vision 2020 was bold. It was it made people uncomfortable and it moved us in a whole new direction. The intent of the task force was to recreate that boldness that would inspire and be truly aspirational. A vision doesn't have to be something you're going to get to but it has to inspire you to want to make a difference. And we as a house adopted that bold statement today. Yeah and it happened today but you've been working on this for a long time. So just give me a brief glimpse of that timeline. So we started the board appointed this task force about 18 months ago. It was a long process that included many external stakeholders, internal stakeholders and the input. We created different opportunities for members to give input to our group. And it was about 18 months in the to this point. get to that externally focused vision that's going to help us improve society. Many people have noted, for example, that some of the things of Vision 2020 haven't been fully achieved yet. There's still work to be done. So first of all, how do we transition from one vision to another and then what happens to that other work? Okay. So the elements of Vision 2020 are really still embedded in the fabric of who we are and many of them are still embedded in the goals and strategic plans of the association. And in addition to make sure that many of those that we still hold dear continue, they are in the guiding principles that will be the companion document. It's really important to recognize the vision has a companion document which is guiding principles which includes all those really important elements that are internally important to us. It is a big day. One more time. Give me the vision statement. Transforming society by optimizing movement to improve the human experience. There was a lot of conversation about the vision here at the house. First there was an open discussion. You can watch any of that. You can also then watch the discussion which they actually just talked about RC 14 which was the vision statement itself and RC 15 which is related to the support to the vision. So you can watch that for the next month at apia.org.slive stream. Some really compelling stuff there. If the human experience at that part of it doesn't speak to you, some of the delegates were very eloquent in describing what the human experience means to them. And I think if you watch that discussion, you'll really sort of that might sink just like the delegates described, how they kind of went from something they were uncomfortable with to something they were really motivated by.

РНК вируса реплифицируется в клетке 100 000 раз, создавая генетический материал для восприниматься новых вирусов. Новые вирусы в свою очередь инфиксируют другие клетки печени. Этот процесс в итоге нарушает нормальную работу клеток печени и повреждает их.

The liver secretes the gel and performs a few important functions. The hepatitis C virus is a blood transfer through the blood of the patagen, which, first of all, affects the liver. The hepatitis C virus in the liver contains its genetic material, RNA, and its ribonuclein acid, and its complex fat block. When the virus hits the body, it is transmitted to the bloodstream. and connect to the liver cells. After this virus releases its RNA to the healthy cells. The RNA is replicated in the cells 100,000 times, producing the same material for the production of new viruses. New viruses, in turn, infect other liver cells. This process eventually breaks the normal work of the liver cells and prevents it. The patient has a higher temperature, pain in the muscles, joints, muscle, work, appetite loss, pain in the abdomen. This infection can take years, leading to the infection of the liver, which is called cirrhosis. At later stages, even cancer can be spread to the liver."

Je demande à Allah, Tha'alain, d'élever les graves de notre maître Muhammad al-Amin, l'honnête, le Véridic, celui qui est appelé à la religion de vérité l'Islam, qui est la religion de tous les prophètes du premier Adam au dernier Muhammad. Chers frères et sœurs, c'est avec plaisir que nous abordons le sujet du Miracle de Almirage dans ce vidéo. après Al-Isra, le voyage nocturne du prophète Muhammad de la Mecca à Palestine. C'est donc à partir de la Palestine que commença l'ascension du prophète vers les sept cieux, plus précisément de la mosquée Al-Aqsa. Ce voyage fut aussi de corps et d'âme, c'est-à-dire en état des veilles et non de rêves. Le prophète fut élevé par l'intermédiaire d'un semblant d'échelle extraordinaire appelé al-Mirkad. Il est monté jusqu'à ce qu'il atteigne le premier Parmi les choses surprenantes que le Messager, s'allait à la vue de la Vue, lors de son ascension au Cieux, elle m'arrange, il y a sa rencontre avec Malik, l'ange gardien de l'enfer. Celui-ci n'a pas souri à la vue de Messager de Allah. Le prophète a alors interrogé Jibril afin de savoir pourquoi il a été Pourquoi il ne lui avait pas souri comme les autres? Jebril lui a répondu, Malik n'a jamais souri depuis que Allah Ta'ala l'a créé. Et s'il devait sourire à quelqu'un, un Rassoul Allah, c'était à toi qu'il sourirait. Le prophète, s'allait al-Alaihe wa-Sallam, a vu dans le septième ciel al-Baitul Mahmour. C'est une maison honorée qui est pour les habitants du ciel, c'est-à-dire les anges comme la Ka'aba pour ceux de la terre. entre 70 000 anges qui font la prière puis en ressortes sans jamais y revenir. Aussi, au 7ème ciel, le prophète, s'allait Allaouh'u Alaihi Wasallam, a vu Sidratul Muntaha, qui est un arbre immense, dans la beauté et telle qu'aucune créature de Allaouh ne pourrait la décrire. Il est parsemé de papillon d'or, sa racine est au 6ème ciel et il atteint le 7ème ciel Allaouh Akbar. Le prophète, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, a également vu le paradis qui se trouve au-dessus des sept cieux. C'est la demeure de la paix, de la félicité et de la joie. Allah l'a créé pour les croyants qui s'y plairont éternellement sans jamais en ressortir. Ils seront dans une félicité éternelle sans fin. Le Messager y a vu les serviteurs éternels du paradis qui sont des créatures de Allah, ni hommes, ni anj, ni jeunes. Il s'appelle Al-Wildan Al-Mukhalladun. semblable aux piliers d'un lit et il est présentement porté par quatre des anges les plus grands. Mais au jour du jugement dernier, les porteurs du trône seront en ombre de huit. Le prophète a aussi vu l'ange Gabriel sous sa véritable apparence, avec six sans elle ouvert. Il s'est rapproché du prophète juste pour le faire. qu'à atteindre une distance de deux coups d'eux ou moins. Et sachez chère frère et soeur que l'ascension du prophète Muhammad, s'allait-il auprès de l'Allah, ne signifie pas qu'il est parvenu à un lieu extrême ou Dieu de mort puisque Allah est le créateur de tous les endroits et qu'il n'a besoin d'aucun d'entre eux. Allah existe avant la création des endroits sans aucun de ces endroits et après les avoir créés, il ne change pas. Vous voyez beaucoup des Arabes qui disent, sauf que la créature fait changer, mais il ne change pas. Il n'est donc pas permis de croire non plus que la créature existe dans tous les endroits, ni dans le ciel, ni sur le trône. Il n'est pas diffus dans l'espace non plus. Il n'est ni près de nous, ni éloigné de nous par la distance. et exemple de tout cela et celui qui croit cela devient Mekrayan ou Alliah ou Allah que Dieu nous en préserve. Pour terminer, sa chèche a cherché le miracle de l'Israël et le Mirage et un des plus grands miracles qui ont été accordés à notre prophète, Muhammad, que ce souvenir éminent revienne à nous dans le mien la sécurité, la paix et la sérénité n'hésitez pas à le commémorer et surtout à l'enseigner à vos proches et parents.","The creator of the world, the one who exists without beginning, without end, without end, without place and without command. After that, the night journey of Prophet Muhammad of the Mecca to Palestine began. This journey was also of the body and soul, that is to say in the state of the eyes and not of the dreams. The Prophet was raised by the intermediate of an extraordinary scale resembling the world called al-Mirkad. He went up to what he reached the first century. 3. He was received by you, but who did the same. Why didn't he smile like the others? 70,000 angels who pray and then come back without ever coming back. Also, in the seventh heaven, the Prophet, peace be upon him, saw this huge tree in the beauty and such that no creature of Allah could describe it. He is full of gold, his roots are in the sixth heaven and he reaches the seventh heaven, Allahu Akbar. The Prophet, peace be upon him, also saw the paradise which is above the seven heavens. It is the tomorrow of peace, of happiness and joy. Allah created it for the believers who will eternaly please each other without ever going out. They will be in eternal happiness without end. The messenger also saw the eternal servants of the paradise which are creatures of Allah neither man nor angel nor young. He is called the Wildan al-Mukhalladun. Allah has created them to serve the people of the Paradise. All believers will have at least 10,000 of these servants of these Wildan al-Mukhalladun. The Prophet, peace be upon him, also saw the roof of the Paradise, the throne, the throne which is the largest body that Allah has created. The throne has four pillars. The same Ali is a student that Allah has said to the subject of the throne, certainly Allah has created the throne by manifestation of his power and he did not take it as a replacement for himself. The prophet also saw the angel Gabriel under his real appearance with six glasses open. and to reach a distance of two koudais or less. You see many Arabs who say, Subhanahu wata'ala, it means that Allah makes the creature change, but He does not change Subhanahu wata'ala. and the example of all this and the one who believes in it becomes a Mekrayan or a Yadubullah that God keeps us. After the return of the messenger Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, of the ascension of Al-Mehran, some did not believe him and missed him. Some among the Mekrayans of Quraish went to see Abu Bakr to report this to him and Abu Bakr to testify of the veracity of our prophet Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, And Abu Salamah reported that it is after this event that Abu Bakr was nicknamed Abu Bakr As-Sidiq, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah is pleased with him. To conclude, his brother and sister have found that the miracle of Isra and Maharaj is one of the greatest miracles that our Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, has been agreed upon. Thus, we ask Allah to bless us May this eminent memory come back to us in good, security, peace and serenity. Do not hesitate to commemorate it and especially to teach your loved ones and parents. May Allah Almighty know and judge. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

It's an essential part of bushcraft so here are a few simple tips on how to use one. With the machete it's in its sheath until you need it. After all it's indiscriminate, it'll bite you as much as it'll bite wood. Before you use it, I want to take this tree down here, I've got a use for that. Before I do I need to make sure I've got clear swipes with the machete. So any vegetation that's in the way, we just clear out of the way like that, making sure we stay well behind the knife. One of the things that's unique about using machetes or pranks is the speed with which the cuts are made. So this is what I'm after. It only takes a few cuts to go through. It's perfect to show some of the ways of cutting with a machete. Now I clean it up. It's got a vine around it here as it comes down. Full arms reach, just trim everything off. I get down to where the branch is no longer thick enough for my intended purpose then I'll truncate it. And I'll do that with just one slash at about 30 degrees. You can see that in this environment a sharp harangue and the right technique means you can collect whatever you need very quickly. It's also worth bearing in mind that it's very hard to work in this environment. It's very humid, you sweat profusely, it's very tiring. So good technique and a sharp harangue makes life easier. Every cut we make with this tool has to be planned. We have to know what we're doing. And we need wherever possible to cut with the grain to our advantage. So we don't cut at 90 degrees to the grain but at an angle to it. A good example of that is how we make a point on a stick. Let's imagine I want to make a stake here with a point on the end. I could cut it through and then sharpen it like a pencil, but I don't need to with this tool. What I do is I'm going to cut about that angle there. I'm obviously completely behind the tool and there's a good bit of wrist action in this cut like so. One, I turn the stick, two, three, and we're almost through. Four. There we go. So we cut it through and end up with a point all in one go. I can further trim that and tidy it in the same manner with a confident action. But you see I've moved my hand further up the parang to give a little bit more fine control. like so. If I want to flatten the top then I'd normally lie down onto a branch or a root like this and good firm blows. It's a very sharp tool, it has to be used with great accuracy. A machete is as versatile as the person using it. With practice no job is too strenuous. A good machete is a real bushcraft friend.","Cutting them needs skill with the single most valuable bushcraft tool, the machete.

So all this basically is that I transformed my looks from longer looks to a shorter bob which I am loving because it goes perfect with the outfit that I am wearing today as well as it is suitable for the summer weather because your hair is off your skin as well as you have just a little in your face. Just to frame your face a bit and to make the hairstyle more feminine and cutesy. So all you will be needing for this tutorial will be some straight pins and these are completely optional and then you will also be needing a black rubber band. So this hairstyle I did it freestyle because I wasn't certain what I wanted to do with my hair and so I recorded it as I went along. It would turn out into an awesome hairstyle that I would share with you guys and I'm in love with it so far because it incorporates a Remember if you do any of my hairstyles, please go ahead and tag me on any one of my social media network I will also be incorporating a video showcase in my outfit and the focal point of the outfit will be this top that I got from SammyJuris.com I like to know how I transform my locks from longer locks to the shorter hairstyle Thank you all to keep on watching. So this is going to be a freestyle hairstyle and I'm trying to record it just in case it turns out pretty awesome then I will have it recorded. So what you want to do is to start off by parting your hair one side larger than the other. So my right side is larger than my left side and that's for no particular reason and I'm just going to take a chunk off here from the front that I will use to make my sweeping band. I'll just set this aside. Then the remainder of my hair I will bring it all the way to the back and make it into a very very low ponytail so you don't want to put your rubber band or your hair tie too close to the root of your hair. So make sure that it is a little distant from the root just at the ends. Something like this because next what you're going to do is to take the ends and just I'm trying to get a short bobby look in here and then go ahead and secure here that's falling out. Just put them under. So you should have something like this so far. Next what you want to do is to take the front portion that you had and your going to take a piece from the top layer about this much. Here I take a piece from the top layer about this much and sweep it under like this and then just try to tuck it into the back of the hair like this and then you're going to take another piece and you're going to repeat that same step something like this. Bring it lower this time and then put it under like that and then the final piece you're going to take it and bring it over and then try to push it under somewhere at the back hopefully it looks nice at the back then these you're going to fix like this and then go ahead and neaten up the hairstyle my battery is about to die I'll go ahead and fix up the hairstyle and then I'll come back. So this is the completed hairstyle guys.

She had her back broken when she was working as a logging elephant in Burma.  She broke her foot, so her greedy owner decided if she couldn't work, she could breed, and chained the sweet elephant down by all four feet. A large bull elephant in musth mounted her and broke her back.  Just one look at her clearly demonstrates what cruel and irresponsible humans can do to damage such a beautiful fellow animal.  She was rescued by Lek, the founder of the Elephant Nature Park, where Medo now lives in peace and freedom as she deserves with her new elephant and human friends who all lover her.   You can see other videos of her on YouTube (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FpKiBzQIs0), and photos of her and others on the Elephant Nature Park's website: http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/index.htm  If you want to see elephants in Thailand DON't go to trekking or other elephant camps-- they are inherently cruel, separating babies from their mothers and families and beating them into performing silly tricks or carrying people on painfully built benches.  Many people I've talked to regret ever going trekking.  Instead visit the Nature Park and feed, bathe, or just observe elephants in their natural, free state under the loving care of Lek and her staff.  You can even stay overnight or, for an experience of a lifetime,  volunteer for longer if you like.

Just got this today finished work and Got home and it was it been delivered through the post and Really happy with this. I'll give you a look. It's a original vintage Empire Strikes Back carded figure and this is low-bought on a 41 back and I'm really happy with this As you guys know, I love my vintage my original vintage stuff and I've got some more carded figures. I've got five Return of the Jedi carded figures up there, 77 backs and this is my first vintage Empire Strikes Back carded figure and yeah it's a 41 back, I'll just give you a quick look at it. It's more or less mint considering it's what 32 years old, it's from 1980 so The bubble is absolutely pristine, the cellotape around the blaster is still in place and the footer as well. The only minor flaw in the bubble is just a little tiny dent. The card also is really flat and it's really really mint. The only annoying thing about it is it's got a crease down there. But I can live with that because I've been after one for after a long time. The image is pretty basic, it's just a picture of a low bot. The coolest thing about it, the two stormtroopers, I think there's a third one behind. I'll give you a look at the back now. What it is, is how we've come to see on the vintage collector and and send like a certain amount of five of them or something and then you get a free figure or whatever the offer is at the time. And yeah, that's it guys. Really, really happy with that. I bid on this. I'm waiting for another one at the minute. I've bought another vintage carded figure. And I bid on this one. I've saw it going for quite a lot of money by now. So I bid on this, not really thinking I'd get it because I didn't bid much so I got it and it was really chuffed. There was a load of people bidding as well and I kind of bid at the last minute and luckily outbid. It was still a reasonable amount but I think I got a good deal on it so I was really happy with that. But yeah, I've got one more coming and that one's a Return of the Jedi carded figure. and I think it's another 77 back but my next thing now is because I want to get I've got five now the sixth return of the Jedi card vintage carded figure coming and so my focus now is going to be to start getting more Empire cards and as you know the return if you're going to start collecting vintage actual real vintage carded figures they the best places starts with the return of the Jedi ones because they're They're a lot cheaper and as it goes back like obviously with the Empire Strikes Back card it gets a little bit more pricey and then if you're looking at a Star Wars like 12 back or 21 back, 20 back, 21 back you're looking at a lot more money. So my now my focus really is to try and get some more Mint on card Empire figures and the next next thing, eventually try and get some of those 12 backs but as we know, very very expensive and same as the power of the force ones as well. But yeah really chuffed with that guys anyway I'll be back with another review. I spoke to the guy, a message guy and he has posted my figure so possibly I think tomorrow or Friday I'll be back with the review of that carded figure. So thanks guys And once again this is the review of the vintage carded 41 back Lobot and take care guys, thoughts and feedback always always appreciate it so until next time guys take care","Hi guys, I'm back again with another review.

En i klassbergrot tillbaksivgutteborg. Första passet precis avklarat. Hur var det? Det var löpning och lite rörlighet att styrka. Det var tufft men det var skönt att komma igång. Vad lärde du dig under tiden i BP? Väldigt mycket. Jag blev en bättre fotbollspelare. Jag blev en bättre människa. Jag fick stå lite på egna ben och ha mycket eget ansvar. Jag blev mycket spelade matcher. Det var bara positivt egentligen men det är oroligt att få tillbaka en tjänstgård. Hur kommer du att använda dig utan den kunskapen och andra vändan i EFK? Jag kommer att ta med mig så mycket jag kan. Ta med mig det här lugnet jag hade i matchen på slutet och självförtroendet. Och göra det som jag är bra på och det som jag är här för. Innan kanske det har blivit lite omständigt i många situationer. Men nu hoppas jag att jag inte har lärt mig att värdera lite bättre. Det känns mycket bra än för 12-12.,"How did you get the first place? I got into the climbing range and I got back to my first pass. How was it? It was a run and a bit of movement and strength. It was tough but it was nice to come again. What did you learn during the time in BP? I got a lot better football players and better people. I got to stand on my own legs and have my own responsibility. I got a lot of games and goals. I was just positive, but it's a shame to have a chance to return to the team. How will you use that knowledge and other friends in the EU? I will take part in as much as I can. I will take part in the games, the games and the self-confidence I had. I will do what I am good at and what I am here for. Before that I have been a bit upset in many situations. But now I hope I can learn to value a bit better. It feels good to keep going until the 12th."

Es decir, que todo el pueblo se supiera que fue él que los libró de su esclavitud. Segundo mandamiento, no tengas otros dioses fuera de mí, no te hagas imágenes, esculturas, de ninguna semejanza de lo que hay en el cielo, en la tierra y en las sábadas debajo de la tierra. no te postre antes en majes, no te vindar culto, porque yo soy Tolokin, un olokin fuerte, celoso, que castigo la mandad de los padres, los hijos, nietos y dignitos de todos los que me recibí, pero hago misericordia por mil generaciones con los que me aman y guardan mis mandamientos. El tercer mandamiento no tomará, no pronunciará el nombre de Hashen en falso en vano, porque lo dará presente el Señor al que tomes un hombre en falso en vano. Cuarto mandamiento. Acuérdate, no te olvides, del día de Shabbat, el sábado, para santificar, para guardarlo, porque dicen no trabajarás en Shabbat. Seis días puedes trabajar y hacer toda tu obra, más el séptimo día es Shabbat, el día de descanso, porque en seis días, Achen creó los cielos y la tierra y todo lo que existe, y el séptimo día reposó, por eso el Señor lo bendijo y lo hizo santo. Es por eso que no debe trabajar ni tu ni tu hijo ni tu sierva ni tu sierva el estranquero que está en tus cuerpos. El quinto mandamiento, hombra tu padre y a tu madre para que se alarguen tus días en la tierra que nace en tu logintedad. no codices la casa de tu projimo ni su mujer ni nada de lo que pertenezca a tu proje. Dice que oyeron estas palabras, el clálico a él, la congregación, y tuvieron mucho temor y dijeron Moché por favor que no nos hables a Shem directamente porque vamos a morir, habla tú con él y luego nos traes sus palabras. Y de esa manera Moché subió al monte y recibió la bendita y la repitió al pueblo, las instrucciones del artístico. Todos los pueblos civilizados han acabado por aceptar gran parte del decálogo o los mismos namientos dado a su pueblo, por Pashán. Y son fundamentos de todas las grandes religiones del mundo, las religiones monoteístas que adoran a unicología. Esta es la gloria del pueblo de Israel el haber transmitido el decálogo al mundo entero y la fe en uno solo, solo todo poderoso. y llenó el lugar donde estaban y se les aparecieron lenguas como de fuego y al escuchar esa explosión tan fuerte dice que vinieron los judíos, los hermanos a ver qué pasaba con nuestros otros judíos y ellos empezaron a profetizar, vieron que habían lenguas de fuego en su cabeza, así hablaban en idiomas diferentes de donde muchos de nuestros hermanos judíos vivían en la diáspora, en la dispersión, ellos estaban asombrados, no son todos estos Galileo, si el promo es que están hablando y esto era el cumplimiento de las profecías de Joel y de otros que había dicho que en los posteriori tiempos de Ramareny y Rúa mi espíritu se amplía sobre toda carne y los jóvenes verán visión y los enseños ancianos soñarán sueños y entonces se estaba cumpliendo todo lo que Hashem había prometido dando sus rubas a Códiz, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espíritu, su espírit de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escritura de la Escrit la Torah y que podamos también nosotros ser llenados de rujacodes porque el rujacodes es el que inspiró las evaluituras es el mismo que también nos da la Torah. Baruch Hashem, penito sea el nombre de su nombre.","The first words, the first commandment, said, I am Adonai, the Tolojim who took you from the land of Egypt, from the house of Serim. That is to say that all the people knew that it was him who gave them their slavery. Second commandment, do not have other gods out of me. Do not make you images, sculptures of any resemblance of what falls in the sky, on the earth and on the sands below the earth. Do not be afraid of the images, do not be afraid of the cult, because I am Tolokin, a strong, jealous person who punishes the command of the parents of a child, grandchildren and grandchildren of all who die. But I make my mercy for a thousand generations with whom I love and keep my commandments. The third commandment, you will not pronounce the name of Hacheng in false or in vain, because the Lord will be innocent when He takes his name in false or in vain. Fourth commandment, Remember, don't forget, on Saturday, Saturday, on Saturday, to sanctify it, to save it, because they say, you won't work in Shabbat. You can work for six days and do your whole work. On Saturday, it's Shabbat, the day of rest. Because in six days, Hashem created the heavens and the earth and everything that exists, and on Saturday he rested, that's why the Lord blessed him and made him holy. That's why he shouldn't work The fifth commandment and he repeated it to the people, the instructions and the altissimo. All the civilized peoples have ended up accepting much of the decalogue or the same commandments given to their people by Pashan. And they are the foundations of all the great religions in the world, the great monotheistic religions that adore a unique religion. This is the glory of the people of Israel, the transmission of the Decalogue to the whole world and the faith in one single one. Only all powerful. That way, we also now in this party that we remember the promulgation of the Torah that was given in 70 languages, the wise ones, and was given with fire, written with fire, and Mount Sinai was burned in fire, this came to have another and this is a deeper compliment when in the renewed pact of the British Dasha, our Mashiach told his talmudic disciples not to leave Jerusalem until they receive the promise of the Great, they will receive the power of the Great and he says that he was at the Shabuotos party, this party remembering the promotion of the Torah in Mount Sinai, we are gathered at the high position and suddenly he says a violent rafah of wind and they didn't know where they were and they appeared in tongues as fire and when they heard that explosion so loud they said that the Jews came, the brothers, to see what happened with our other Jews and they began to prophesy, they saw that there were tongues of fire in their heads and they spoke in different languages from where many of our Jewish brothers lived in the diaspora, in the dispersion, they were astonished, they are not all these Galileo's, the joke is that they are talking and this was the fulfillment of the prophecies of Joel and others who had said that in the post-times of Ramadhan and Rua, my scriptures, especially the flesh, and the young will see and the ancient teachings will dream. And then everything Hashem had promised was fulfilled, giving his rua to God and his scripture to the people. of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit and that we can also be filled with the Red Cross because the Red Cross is the one who inspired the fairies, it is the same one that also gives us the Torah. Baruch Hashem, may the name of his soul be with you."

I was thinking, I got a friend, a guy who used to work with a few years ago, I'm not going to mention your name but you know you are, if I'm not a big man. He would class himself as Zimbabwean, and he's white. I've said to white masses before when they said to me, you know, get the fuck out of Europe and get back to Africa and I've said to them, well, get the fuck out of America then because that's not your country. You're not indigenous. They're saying about indigenous people. You're not indigenous to America. Ah, but they're arguments are we, we, the white man built the nation. Built the nation how? So what, how do you define building a nation? Constitutionally, physically, Because if you're saying physically I wouldn't say the white man built anything really, maybe designs and stuff, but you had the Indian, the Chinese, the blacks to name a few built that country, buildings and such, infrastructure I should say, railways and all that. Not saying there wasn't any white men involved in it, of course there were, but I mean it was a nation of people of all colours and creeds who did that constitutionally then not to say that when you look at the Civil War and such like that when we look at the Constitution that it was set up just to protect black people and the wars wasn't about just slavery it was about lots of different things from that but it doesn't really stack up does it? So I don't see how Americans can say well it's a white only nation. It was built by lots of others. Leave me some comments on what you think on that. If you were somebody whose white was born in a black country or a non-white country and you consider that your home, how would you feel about that? where you actually came from, your ancestry where it actually comes from. So you'd be forced to go back now, would you be happy to go there? Or would you be like, no I want to stay here. So what would happen then? What would white masses do then? You're going to physically force people out to their homes, force them to live in places they don't want to live. It seems like you guys are all about freedom of speech, or so you reckon, and these different types of things of freedom for the white race. But then I think you're going to have a lot a white people coming back and you saying you know fuck you we're staying where we are we don't want to go where you tell us to go my solution I heard one was a bit extreme and I can say the R word now so you know don't get upset but they said like with these racists there was a video on YouTube but he was he said I got the solution he said I've sorted the solution he said we just kill all the racists no matter what colour we just kill them all and then we get rid of that problem. That's a bit extreme. But maybe we should invest some technology and say, right, okay, all of these white nationalists and black nationalists, hey look, there's racist black people, there's racist Indian people or whatever, any kind of color of skin you want to say, there's racist people within that. So you're not kidding yourself, you're on the corner of that market just for yourself, okay? and say let's take the moon and create an atmosphere or some kind of bubble dome or something like that. Ship you guys up there and say look you've got all this and you can look at the earth and say well look at that beautiful, beautiful planet. This little dot. As I'm looking at the pale blue dot poster across from me. Yeah Carl saying maybe you should read that if you can read. Have a look at that. Maybe make you think a bit more about why the fuck are we fighting over a little speck. Really. some comments guys see what you think and hello"

So this has been a big topic recently specifically in the states around the presidential election and prior to the election the Obama administration had a hearing to determine if insurance companies should be covering birth control under their policies. Now at this hearing the Republicans presented five key witnesses all of which were men discussing what was deemed at the hearing as a women's issue. unbalanced and unequal representation within the hearing and about I think it was a week after this the Republicans held a hearing of their own which they had one key witness Sandra Fluc who was a law student. Now she presented her case stating birth control should be covered under policies because individuals like herself who are here sorry who is a student is unable to afford birth control so she should have the right to have access to this. Now she received quite a bit of criticism from especially something we discussed in class, Rush Limbaugh, stating that she was a slut and a prostitute and she should be posting her videos online for everyone to see considering the citizens are paying for her to have sex. This is obviously quite ridiculous and far-fetched. Nobody's asking all the men who are on Viagra in the States, as this is covered by most insurance companies, to be posting their videos online. This makes the media and brush quite a huge hypocrite considering he was arrested himself or sorry he was detained at an airport trying to go into the Dominican Republic because he had Viagra on him. So the key issue here would be why do men have access to the right for reproductive rights but women don't. Men have the coverage where women shouldn't. It's kind of like I said already a hypocrisy. So we're just wondering what you think your opinions are so feel free to post below and I will be posting a link to Limbaugh's comments as well as Sandra Flukes and thank you for watching.","Hi, this is Jamie from College Menace and as we come to show we're going to be discussing reproductive rights. So this has been a big topic recently specifically in the states around the presidential election and prior to the election the Obama administration had a hearing to determine if insurance companies should be covering birth control under their policies.

He is also Professor of Medicine and Cancer Biology at Vanderbilt, American Cancer Society Clinical Research Professor and Director of the Vanderbilt Breast Cancer Program. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. You're welcome. Could you begin by discussing some of the key translational insights that we've seen in the last year? Well, Michelle, there are several translational insights. That one that comes to mind, and I'm excited about it, about is the development of Trastuzum of DM1. It's a conjugate that has had shown remarkable activity in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that have progressed after the standard anti-HER2 therapies. The response rate has been so remarkable that that anticipates that this drug would move to the, to earlier in the disease, in HER2 positive disease. It's going to have a major impact and increase the number of patients with this disease that we're now cure with and antiheratotherapy. not been treated before the time they're operated to try to score the response of those tumors to those new drugs. And try to get a signal in those tumors that show some activity and try to profile them and try to develop biomarkers of those tumors that show that response to those drugs. So we can then, when we do efficacy studies with those new agents, we can select better patients based on those biomarkers we discussed cover using these innovative clinical trials. So I think there's a realization that the traditional clinical trials process without patient selection or without patient exclusion from trials where we know these drugs are not going to work has not worked to the best way they should have. They've been too slow, I think, and I think we all realize we have to come up with new designs that allow us to early in the clinical development of these drugs develop biomarkers that allow us to select patients for the right drug. And that's actually something you're working on with Stand Up to Cancer, your dream team principal for the project targeting PI3K and women's cancers. And the project's goal is to discover approaches that will predict which patients will respond positively to PI3K inhibitors and that will accelerate personalized cancer treatment. May I ask you how that project is going, doctor? That project is going really well. I should highlight that that project involves six centers in the US and one in Spain. It has not only a clinical component but also a basic science component and a preclinical component. I think that the trial is going really well. I mean, we are lined up with all the companies, I mean all the companies that are developing pediatricitis inhibitors are very interested in talking to us and we are just about to initiate a number of clinical trials in endometrial cancer, inovarion cancer and in breast cancer too. testing several, not all, but several of the biotrachines inhibitors that completed phase one development, that have for which, the compounds for which there's safety information, and for which they have a pretty good sense of what those we should use. So I think it was going well as we should. We have teleconferences about every two weeks, and we have again protocols ready to go. We are in active discussions with the companies that make these drugs. And again, there's an enormous interest from all of us in the team to start working as soon as we can so we can deliver within the time of the grant. And it's a three-year time period? It is a three-year time period. We realize that for what we want to do, which is a very ambitious undertaking, three years is too short. But we would like to, at a minimum, show as much momentum as we can in the first three years. And we're confident that we will get there. Could you comment on what the assembly process of the Standup to Cancer team has been like? Well, again, I should underscore that the three main leaders of the team where I belong are Luke Cantley, Charles Sawyer, and Gordon Mills. The assembly has been basically, first of all, the division of different teams We have one that these were cell lines and preclinical models, one with mouse models and one with clinical trials. And again, as I said, we have a very intense regular teleconference series. We have constant communication by email. We have already three face-to-face meetings, and we have three more planned for the next year. I'm not sure what else to say other than the assembly has been driven by our hunger and desire to get the work done. Thank you very much Dr. Artiaga. I appreciate it.

The guys are giving me a lot of support and it's a good start for myself by scoring on my debut. I am sure that I will transform the scoring feeling into the league and give 100% every time I get a chance to play. I think they won't be a different team to play all together. I think based on their coaches' philosophy of how they play, we're expecting a tough game, a very physical game. But I think more important is for our own preparation, what we intend to do on the day. coming onto the game we've got our own ambitions and what we want to achieve.

I ho fem després d'haver estat convidats amb Jesús al desert, del silenci, després de sentir l'imitació de dir, pare, aquest és el meu fill, escolta-l, després de sentir la crida de Jesús, si no, compareixes, i la cosa em pitjorarà més. i també la invitaria a tornar a casa. Aquest dimenge tenim davant dels ulls un regal, una escena que per mi és espectacular i en la que descobri un Jesús que fa calcón impressionant. Atura el ritme, fixeu-lo. La Evangeli comença amb un lloc on no hi prenen comptes. Della de les Lliberes. Jesús està sol. Jesús, per tant, de les Lliberes hi va... I tot pregant somna del sent, de la llum, de la força, que el prepararà per la jornada que comença. I no sap què li prepara. La nostra pregària és un preparar-nos pel dia. Un preparar-nos pel que n'hi ha de desbord. I es us plena aquest sent, aquesta pau, i d'aquesta justícia de dir-nos, la ricòria de dir-nos, la propa, en aquell timbre. I aquesta, aquesta espècie de joc de mans a tu del temps, quan aquells fariseus l'insistencem, tampoc jo no t'entendem. Vés-te'n, no et veguis. Ell ens vol donar un higmús amb la grie, aquesta notícia d'aquest nou senpare francès. El seu desig de que comenci monocamia fracermia, de paraula que ens pot sonar estrany, convidar a unir-nos a aquest somni, que cal que hi posem nosaltres a la zona. Ens demanem un ui per totes les gries.","in the most esteemed moments, this message comes from the culmination of this parallelism of the coreism and we do it after having been invited to Jesus in the desert, to the silence, after hearing the invitation of saying, Father, this is my daughter, listen, after hearing the cry of Jesus, if you do not share, the thing will get worse. and also the invitation to go home. This image is a gift, a scene that seems spectacular. And in this discovery, Jesus makes the impression of the tree. The Gospel begins with a place where we can see the world. Jesus is alone. and all the prayer of the 100, of the light, of the strength, that will prepare him for the day that begins. He prepares him. Our prayer is to prepare ourselves for the day, to prepare ourselves for what comes next. Jesus pleads this 100, this peace, and this justice of God, the mercy of God, is appropriate in that temple. And this kind of game demands all the time. When you do it, you insist. They say that they are exposed and that they are charged with their own justice and their verdict in front of that adult. Jesus, let go of his stone, his bomb, and be free to sin. I have the first time. And we are committed to do something not about the life of others, but about our own. Who are you? You have to be a sinner. You don't have to sin. You can sin. Jesus invites us. I don't understand either. He wants to unite us with the laugh, this news of this new French father, his desire to start a new life, a word that can sound strange, invite us to unite this memory, that we have to put ourselves in the dark. We ask for all the news."

And even when he passed the parade, his friends surrounded him with beautiful fans. And only to give a dance he decided only one woman. Larissa Kozlova.

The tabloid juices and even the most straight-laced journalist. All it needs is a naive older politician allegedly caught up in a honey trap and that the spy should be Russian, female and pretty preferably blonde. And if she wears shorts, cursing, there are pictures of her smiling seductively. So much the better. Well, we've got all that in the latest one. And what makes it even juicier is that the lady in question was actually given a job as a parliamentary researcher and could wander the corridors of power, freed a Hoover up all the secrets that came away. Should we hide under our beds or laugh out loud? Well, Sir Christopher Mayer knows about this sort of thing. At least he should. He's been a diplomat for years, wrote at the top of the tree, our man in Washington. I'm also joined by Lord West, who was no less than the nation's security minister under the last government. Sir Christopher Mayer, I'll bet you were invagled into the odd honey trap in your time, weren't you? Well, not exactly. I mean, there were a number of times when honey traps were laid before me. Ah. But as I thought of Queen and Empire, We have only your word for that! Well, that's that! Really? Well, at the same time, wasn't it? But I've said it now. But I mean that was that was a honey honey traps were always around in the old Soviet days It's a very it's a very traditional country and I think that includes its intelligence services So I'm not at all surprised to hear this stuff at all that they're still honey trapping away in the halls I really desperately want to know how far the honey trap got with you I mean do you want to be you know here's your chance well I mean got nowhere at all because it was so ludicrous and so clumsy once in Moscow you know, it was so crass that you had to laugh. So there you go. Well, I hesitate to ask you whether Lord, given your background, highly distinguished again, all that sort of stuff, were you ever tempted? I was about to say tempted, no, of course you weren't tempted, obviously you weren't tempted, but we were a bit approached. I generally assume that if some very attractive young girl thought that an old blighter like me was so gaunt just witty, charming and delightful that there was something funny behind it. And the answer is yes it was. And the one occasion he got very close, my leading steward who was looking after me sacrificed his body for the nation. So all they got was a leading steward instead of the chief of intelligence. And I thought he deserved a dog for that. But anyway, that's enough of that I think. Quite. Did he get an MBE or something that's unmentionable? I don't think I could mention more on this programme. Is there a serious aspect? I mean, should we be worried? form a security minister? I think there are a couple of assets. One is it's of interest, I think that the level of Russian espionage has risen again. When the Soviet Union collapsed, I think there was a hope that perhaps this would fall away. It's definitely got, it's greater than it was. And that of course means it uses assets from the security service. So they're having to use people to cover espionage when actually there are very serious threats of Al Qaeda inspired terrorism, Northern Ireland terrorism is rising, they're a pressure. So that is upsetting. And a lot of that espionage was to do with commercial advantage and to do with industrial espionage. But a whack of it is still to do with defencing, particularly stuff to do with our nuclear deterrent, particularly stuff to do with things that give us global capability. Right, but mostly commercial now, Cosmayo? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hear what Lord West said. I've always been told by friends in contacts in MI5 that the targets are very widespread. They were certainly commercial and economic when I was in the foreign office back in the 80s and 90s. as well as defence. And I think they pick the targets they want to pick and commercial, economic and defence, that's all in the mix. Plus political blackmail if they can manage it. But you look at what's on WikiLeaks to take just that single example, though it's a massive example admittedly, and you wonder why anybody has to bother any longer? Well, despite the massive information that's been dumped by WikiLeaks and the massive information you can find anyway on the internet, there's always more to be garnered. And I think the challenge I was going to say, what it allows you to do as an analyst is you are able to pull all these pieces together and an analyst can then make more out of it. So yes, they are targeting things. I think what's very interesting in this case is in the Palace of Westminster that is not a state department, therefore things like vetting are not run by the security service. And I do think that the Palace of Westminster is a very important place for the government to be. to need to have a think about this and say what checks do we actually do? I mean it's interesting isn't it that this man had lots of Russians assisting him? I mean there are lots of British students who are quite capable. I mean I find it quite extraordinary really and I do think the Palace of Westminster needs to look at it a little bit more closely. Well it's all pretty cack-handed isn't it? Do you despair when you see that sort of increase Mayor? You've got about 10 seconds. To a degree yes, I do despair. That's the short answer. I do despair when I see that. It's ludicrous. And have we lost any big secrets in your time? Who's the question being asked? You've got... You've got... I don't have things to say about that! Yes, yes, Honour, we'll do. So, the Admiral knows the answer. The Admiral knows the answer. Any... Alan, quick one? Question? Secret? One always has to assume that the enemy is getting hold of secrets. Right. Got it. Alan West, Lord West and Christopher Mayer. Thanks both very much.","Six minutes to nine, there's nothing quite like a good spy story to stir. The tabloid juices and even the most straight-laced journalist. All it needs is a naive older politician allegedly caught up in a honey trap and that the spy should be Russian, female and pretty preferably blonde. And if she wears shorts, cursing, there are pictures of her smiling seductively, so much the better. Well, we've got all that in the latest one. And what makes it even juicer is that the lady in question was actually given a job as a parliamentary researcher and could wander the corridors of power, freed her Hoover up all the secrets that came away. Should we hide under our beds or laugh out loud? Well, Sir Christopher Mayer knows about this sort of thing. At least he should. He's been a diplomat for years, wrote at the top of the tree, our man in Washington. I'm also joined by Lord West, who was no less than the nation's security minister under the last government. Sir Christopher Mayer, I'll bet you were invagled into the odd honey trap in your time, weren't you? Well, not exactly. I mean, there were a number of times when honey traps were laid before me. Ah. But as I thought of Queen and Empire, We have only your word for that. Well, that's that. Oh, yeah. Really? Well, at the same time, wasn't it? I've said it now, but I mean that was that was a honey honey traps were always around in the old Soviet days It's a very it's a very traditional country and I think that includes its intelligence services So I'm not at all surprised to hear this stuff at all that they're still honey trapping away in the halls I really desperately want to know how far the honey trap got with you I mean do you want to be you know here's your chance well I mean got nowhere at all because it was so ludicrous and so clumsy once in Moscow you know, it was so crass that you had to laugh. So there you go. Well, I hesitate to ask you whether Lord, given your background, highly distinguished again, all that sort of stuff, were you ever tempted? I was about to say tempted, no, of course you weren't tempted, obviously you weren't tempted, but we were a bit approached. I generally assume that if some very attractive young girl thought that an old blighter like me was so gaunt just witty, charming and delightful that there was something funny behind it. And the answer is yes it was. And the one occasion it got very close, my leading steward who was looking after me sacrificed his body for the nation. So all they got was a leading steward instead of the chief of intelligence. And I thought he deserved a dog for that. But anyway, that's enough of that I think. Quite. Did he get an MBE or something unmentionable? I don't think I could mention any more on this programme. Is there a serious aspect? I mean should we be worried? form a security minister? I think there are a couple of assets. One is it's of interest, I think that the level of Russian espionage has risen again. When the Soviet Union collapsed, I think there was a hope that perhaps this would fall away. It's definitely got, it's greater than it was. And that of course means it uses assets from the security service. So they're having to use people to cover espionage when actually there are very serious threats of Al Qaeda inspired terrorism, Northern Ireland terrorism is rising, they're a pressure. So that is upsetting. And a lot of that espionage was to do with commercial advantage and to do with industrial espionage. But a whack of it is still to do with defencing, particularly stuff to do with our nuclear deterrent, particularly stuff to do with things that give us global capability. Right, but mostly commercial now, Cosmeo. Well, I don't know. I mean, I hear what Lord of Wests said. I've always been told by friends in contacts in MI5 that the targets are very widespread. They were certainly commercial and economic when I was in the foreign office back in the 80s and 90s. as well as defence. I think they pick the targets they want to pick and commercial, economic and defence, it's all in the mix. Plus political blackmail if they can manage it.

The water in the river is not further than in the past two days. The problem that we now have in the Netherlands is that we cannot move any more. The whole area of the N-Veneli underwater is there.

It's just on two strings and what I'm doing here is we're kind of going through the chords from that song that we talked about. So we're starting off here on the first string. We're doing a pull-off from 14 to 10 and then we're doing 12th fret on the second string doing that bunch of times. Then the next arpeggio is a pull-off from 12 to 9 top string and then 11th fret on the second string. Then still doing the 12 to 9 on the top top string but then doing 10 on the second string. Next up, our Joe is 10 to 7 on the first string and then 9 on the second string. And then 10 to 5 is a bit of a stretch, so you have to practice that. 10 to 5 on the top string, again pull off. And then 7 on the second string. And then we're doing similar kind of thing here. 7 to 3 on the top string. And then 5 on the second string. and then 9 to 6 on the top string and then go down to 7 on the second string. Alright, put that all together. First two, slide up to the 8th, 18th fret top string and after the next two. 16 on top string, next two, this is the 10 to 7 one. 14, next two, Again, so that's 14. Okay? Right.

I'm going to tell you why it's getting very dangerous for elderly driving at a certain age and why they should take yearly driving tests. I've looked at statistics for wrecks involving elderly driving and they're increasing over the past 10 years. the risk factors of elderly driving. The first risk factor is their vision. As a person starts to get older, their vision starts to get worse and worse, making it hard to see simple signs such as a stop sign, yield sign, etc. maybe even a stop light. Hearing loss. Say an elderly person is about to get in a wreck. A horn is supposed to prevent that help of a person from getting into a wreck but they will not be able to hit the horn. hear the horns, could actually maybe get them in the wreck actually. And then limited mobility, say as younger people, first we're driving off the road, we have that reaction time to swear back onto the road. As an elderly person, it's harder for them to, for those reaction times to swear back on the road, making it almost impossible. Why is it important for elderly to, to take yearly driving tests. Yearly driving tests for the elderly cannot protect not only the driver but everyone around them. The driving test will decide if that person is qualified to drive on the highways and the streets. The law. Right now the law states that a person can renew his or her driver's license through mail or electronically at the age, up to the age of 79, which I personally believe should be lowered to 70 maybe even less than 70. Once again, taking the elderly ones that are way too old to drive will also make us as people driving on the road feel a lot more safe. Last, I will give you three statistics. In 2008, more than 5,500 adults were killed and more than 183,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes. This amount to 15 older adults killed and 500 injured and crashes on an everyday basis. There were 33 million licensed older drivers in 2009, which is a 23% increase from 1999 to 2009. Studies from AAA shown that older drivers have high death rates and lower rates of involvement in crashes that kill others, but most studies have not. Consider drivers responsibilities for their crashes and many have considered only a particular measure of risk and last Relative to other age groups drivers age 85 and older face the highest risk of their own death whereas as teens and younger adults the greatest risk to passengers occupants and other vehicles and non motorists the oldest drivers pose more risk to other road users than middle-aged drivers do The degree of excess risk depends strongly upon how the risk is measured. These results demonstrate the importance of keeping clear what risk is more relevant when discussing measures targeting higher risk groups. In conclusion, there are many reasons and facts behind why the elderly should have yearly driving tests. First, I told you the risk factors with elderly driving. Second, I told you why it's important for the eligibility to take yearly driving test and last I gave you three great statistics. Just remember, not only will this help the elderly age groups but also us as young men and women.","I've never been driving down the road going about 70 miles an hour and then all of a sudden you try to pass someone and then you find someone that's going 40 and then you pass them and realize that it's an elderly driver.

Although its a little redundant for a Supergun.  I had a spare Megadrive 2 knocking around and fancied doing a project  on it so I made this. I did it with a little twist though as rather than having the Jamma edge sticking out of the side of the case I remodelled the casing and added in another expansion port to cover the edge connector. My aim was to have it looking like a normal Megadrive 2 on my console shelf but really it is an arcade board now. Inside it has 2 players control pads so that the controls run through the jamma edge. Player 1 is sandwiched underneath the motherboard and player 2 sits on top of it.  This video shows some Megadrive and a Mega-CD game working on it. :-)  Check out my blog : www.porlzilla.com for how I made it,"jamma, megadrive2, home made, sega, jammadrive, megadrive, homemade, megadrve 2, supergun, super gun, jamma drive",932,9,4,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/lVx0-MshFNA.mp3,"OK, it's all screwed back together and I've mounted it to my Mega CD1. Good old Sonic the Hedgehog in there. There's going to be enough light, you'll be able to see. There it is. Jammer edge, there we go. Sits nicely inside the case and hopefully I haven't moved it too much. Here's the wire that goes down, goes into the back of the Mega CD. Oh, I think my video just flipped there. OK, hopefully it didn't too much. fire it up. Super gone on, arcade speaker there. Here we go. I find that some games fire up really quick. Other games, notably Konami games, take a little while to get going. Here we go, running full screen, full speed, and using my arcade stick. This is the start button. There you go, there's Sonic. Turn him up. Right. So essentially this will be an arcade machine, it's a little bit redundant for me here because I have only a TV and I have other Mega Drives anyway, but it was a fun project. So if I ever get an arcade machine which I would love to get, this would work in it. And as you can see this is now like a Neo Geo MBS motherboard and this is your cartridge. You plug this in, power it up. arcade machine backup and hopefully zombies will start. Ah here we go for some reason the Konami games have to be started in um in palm palm mode I think this might do it and then it seems to take a little while for the screen to start up it's the same with the mega cd it does work but why it takes so long I'm unsure so imagine if this was now I'd just flick it to full screen There we go, to NTSC. Again, zombies, you never had that on the arcade system so it will be pretty awesome to play on an Aero City or a Woody or whatever. So, right, okay, so that's the Mega Drive games working. Turning off, there we go, unplug, make sure you're still sitting in. Right, and we'll power, oh, make sure I switch it back across, okay. The CD is only starting up in the region that they've been set for so it needs to be all set to PAL. Again it takes a second for the screen to fire up. Obviously you can hear the sound there. You may be able to guess what game it is in a sec. Looks pretty sweet I think the setup. Really pleased with how it's turned out. And the fact that it looks stock on the shelf. I'm real pleased with that. Here we go, screen should come on in a sec. Obviously this will be a real pain in the bum if you've got an arcade machine and you want to play this but it may work a lot better on the arcade machine. Here you go, it's fired up. Now if I reset it... Alright, let's try this again. My camera ran out of memory so I've had to edit it. Here we go, so I've reset it now after it has started playing. So, this drive ejects when you reset. Hit start. Here we go. So as you could have probably told from the music of when it was loading up, it's Final Fight CD that's in which I think a lot of people think is a definitive home version. It has loading times which sucks but the graphics are awesome, it's two player, sprites and everything are super large on the screen. CD audio now stereo audio, but it's been pumped through to mono arcade speaker but arcade machines are mono it works fine, so that's all good. Let's see if this will adjust. It's gonna go super bright. There we go You can see it's nice and crisp. It's running RGB through the jammer edge Which is all good looks obviously better on CRT with scan lines, but I don't have the room here so this is what I've got to deal with so not bad at the end of the day so I'll show you it working arcade stick all good so loading times sucks but if you can't afford the CPS1 Final Fight board which obviously is what you would prefer this is a good alternative I think just showing about loading times but I can get past that for an awesome game guy, favourite dude, so we're going to show it a bit of work. That's it, kick those bins. So rather than having the sort of dead feeling Mega Drive arcade stick, got a proper arcade stick here working, you see a bunch of these dudes in the face, obviously remastered all some soundtracks. So that's pretty good. But the soundtracking everything is beside the point. This is all about my jammer drive and they're pretty easy enough to make if you're used to using the soldering iron and you're not too scared about giving it a go really you wouldn't encounter the breaking the processor like I did you don't touch that when you do the mod normally so yeah there you go it's another thing to my collection just a fun little project really as I don't have an arcade machine but there you go so Jammer Drive 2 pretty cool See ya!","OK, it's all screwed back together and I've mounted it to my Mega CD1.

Siamo oggi alla prima puntata della trasvisione di questo campionato 2009-2010. Per noi è il 13esimo anno che siamo in Onda, per questo ringraziamo Toscana TV.com che ci permette di andare in Onda, ringraziamo i nostri telespettatori che sono sempre più numerosi e ringraziamo i nostri sponsor che ci sostengono. Oggi ci troviamo all'American Show di Signia e appunto cominciamo questa prima puntata prima di adentrarci nei temi, negli argomenti di oggi, Monica ci presenta subito il nostro team. Buonasera a tutti, vado a presentare gli ospiti di stasera, Claudio De Solati, Antonio Morelli, Marcello Vaccaro che per stavolta fa l'opinionista, Gino Fugliese titolare dell'American Show e Adriana, delle più belle ballerine del locale? Ovviamente appunto come dicevo prima di adentrarci nei temi c'è Marcello che ha una sorpresa per noi perché ci ha preparato una sabella Marcello che ovviamente si sa è un esperto di pronossici, un esperto di posazioni, di nuove, etc. e qui dice questa sabella che Marcello ha una sorpresa insomma un po' per tu, non sappiamo? Piano piano ci rilegano a fare da comparsi il mondo è ormai tutto delle donne, è spettamente gioco, giusto e giusto. Bene comunque Camilla è già tant'anni che è con noi quindi io sono contento di dare più spazio a lei che inizia a parlare qua al presenta, accompagnato ovviamente da Monica, sono belle ragazze, quindi fanno più bella figura di me. Giusto, c'è il tuo. No, no, su bella figura di te, no, possibile però. delle cose ci vuole quindi devo intervenire anche io e io volevo dire questo, come c'è stato un po' di polemica specialmente su una dichiarazione di Marcello Lippi ha detto per me vince la Juve e di solito Lippi non fa pronostici così categolici però stavolta l'ha fatto si vede convinto e gli piace questa Juve. Io però voglio dire l'opinione, il pronostico o di Lippi o di altre allenatori o di giornalisti oppure ex giocatori valgono come quelli di qualunque noi, il tifoso che può fare un pronostico perché non è detto se l'ha detto un allenatore è più sicuro che indovinano, no, perché le agenzie di scommesse si basano su professionisti, cioè è fatto parte io di questa categoria e buchi maker li pagano e quindi scome muovono decine decine centina di milioni di euro a settimana, i competenti veri sono quelli che determina le quote, poi per nostri cicchiunque li può fare, poi lo vina, poi lo sbagliare, come può sbagliare anche il Bookmaker, però la quota quella vera, la percentuale che ora Monica ci elencherà è questa, cioè quella che vale che tecnicamente è la più consola alla valore della squadra, poi può vincere anche una una squadra molto meno quotata che questo tra l'altro da molto tempo non succede, vero Morelli? Quindi ora Monica per favore ci puoi leggere questa tabella così di fossi vedono la regia Mattia Linondo un po' e così poi ne parleremo, posizionale iniziando da l'amico De Soati la nostra colonna della trasmissione. di 52,63. La Juventus cotata 3,50 che corrisponde a 22,22. Milan cotata 5 che corrisponde a 16,66. La Roma cotata a 20, 4,76%. La Fiorentina a 50 che corrisponde a una percentuale di 1,96. Il Napoli cotata a 75 che corrisponde a 1,31%. la Ma io l'ha detto in momento in cui lui ha visto le partite delle comprese della team e le altre partite, dove ha visto una Juve secondo lui, quella più organizzata e quella che è secondo lui è la squadra più forte. Però Morigno ha scosso quando l'Inter face gli interviste e disse che il vicevero l'Inter, nessuna lezione nulla. Cioè è possibile che tutta la volta c'è qualche problema, Morigno debba dirla sua. Svelamo lui può dire, per esempio, i nostri italiani non c'è stato un renatore che ha aperto vota. E questo a me non piace, questo non è un comportamento da un vero personista come dice lui di essere all'altesa della situazione, questo secondo me non è tutto, non è possibile che uno un po' così, no, quest'anno vince la razza, no, non va bene perché pensa subito che ci sia qualcosa sotto che lo fanno perdere, vuol dire che è poco intelligente perché la demonstrazione può essere realmente tranquilla avendo 40 giocatori di quel calibro, cioè mi siamo postusto che uno possa pensare che Ma che una parola di Lippi li possa chiedere questo problema. Perché ha detto che quest'anno sono da lui, la vinci alla Juventus. Ma un po' assoluto, dai. Il Cragliamo ha pronostito tu su quest'anno? Per me lo vinci alla Juve, perché attualmente io vi stiamo anche alla partita... Altra scorsa di Mersi. Ma ok, ma no, fate fatela uno scorso. Allora se lo sai fa io non mi vorrei sbagliare, ma lo scorso mi sembrava di messi alla Juventus. Quando era metà classifica che mi siano alla Mersi invece, e poi non era nelle prime quattro. La Juventus era una scorsa e ha partito a male. però quest'anno io penso che aveva due squadre da mettere in campo e quest'anno l'Aiventus ha fatto di azzeccato veramente dei giocatori di adazze per quel ruolo lì e secondo me è quello da più forte. Quindi l'audio dice Juventus e Antonio se non sbaglio, Antonio l'Aiventus diceva che la si chiede tra le prime 4, io usatemi se sbaglio, non si era bilanciato di tanto, vero? per la nostra trasmissione, che io poi non sono voto per motivi politici perché non si potrebbe essere presente, ma io avevo già detto che arrivava a guarda. Però il problema, vedi, il problema nella Juventus, attualmente io dici che andava via Ranieri qualche giorno mi so, mi era vero, poi si avverà. Quest'anno bisogna dare atto alla dirigenza della Juve, troppo, non è che si può dire che ha fatto gli acquistamenti, stimirati ognuno è il posto suo, ognuno è il suo posto, con l'ultimo corpo che ha fatto Di Rosso mi ha dato a coprire una piccola laguna che aveva in difesa. Detto questo, attualmente oggi mi sento anch'io di dire che tra Indere e Juventus secondo me sono giocheranno ai foto-finici però poi alla fine vedremo chi sarà la vincente, però quest'anno chiaramente credo di più in questa Juve perché è una Juve formata bene, quadrata, aggrinda, a spessore, non ha un allenatore giovane, non ha un allenatore che dorme perché la niente dormiva, io lo dicevo, poi si diceva di no. Però il problema di Vipi che dice che la Juve vince lo scudetto, ma ragazzi, non si può sognare una volta ogni tanta che noi, non? Cioè, non lo dico, se non rubavo due scudetti, si fa uno stradio e si dico, faccio sognare che si vince, che se ne vinge uno, no? Morigno, l'assemble a dirla sua, come diceva Claudio","Welcome back to this new season of the new year of the T-Fo and Borsa. We are here today at the first season of the 2019-2010 season. For us it's the 13th year that we are in London. We thank Toscana TV.com for allowing us to go to London. We thank our viewers who are always more numerous and we thank our sponsors who support us. Today we are at the American Show of Signs. Before we start the first episode of the series, Monica will introduce us to the team. Good evening everyone, I will introduce the guests of this evening Claudio Desolati, Antonio Morelli, Marcello Vaccaro, Gino Fuglese, of the most beautiful ballerinas of the local. Obviously, as we said before, we have to enter the premises of Marcello, which is a surprise for us because Marcello has prepared a sable, who is a prognosis expert, a expert in nail polish, nail polish, etc. And here there is this sable, which is a surprise for all of us. The world is normal, especially women, it's just right. Well, Camilla is already so old that she's with us, so I'm happy to give more space to her who starts talking, who presents, accompanied by Monica, they're beautiful girls, so they make me a better figure. Right, Ciro? No, no, a better figure, no, impossible, but... I want to say this, how did it become a bit of a problem especially on a statement of Marcello Lippi, he said that he would win the Juve and usually Lippi does not make pro-nostic or categoricals but this time he did it, you can see he convinced and he likes this Juve. I want to say the opinion, the pro-nostic or the Lippi or the other the players, or the journalists, or the ex-players, or the players, they are like the fans of any of us who can make a pro-nostic, because it is not said that if a coach has said it, it is safer than in doubt, because the agency of the commission is based on professionals, that is, I am part of this category, and the bookmakers pay them, and therefore, since they move tens and tens of hundreds, millions of euros, The real competitors are those who determine the quota. Then the pro-nostics can do it, then guess and can make mistakes. How can the booking maker make mistakes? But the real, the percentage quota that Monika will give us now is this, that is, the one that technically is the most suitable for the value of the team. This is a very less-quoted team, which has not happened for a long time. So now Monica, please read this table so that you can see the regia Matini Nonda. Then we will talk about it, starting with the micro-desoad, our column of transmission. The youth is divided by 3.5 and corresponds to 22.22. Milan is divided by 5 and corresponds to 16.66. Rome is divided by 20 and corresponds to 4.76%. Fiorentina is divided by 50 and corresponds to 1.96%. The minimum is Lazio, quoted at 100, Udinese, Sampdoria and Palermo, 250, which correspond to a 0.46% in complexity. Very good. I understand everything else. Yes. You, Camilla, the Palermo. Yes, I understood. I was saying, now there is a nice difference, Claudio, between the first and the mass, let's say. I'm used to it. Anyway, we left a speech of Lipi, who said that for him this year he will win the match. He saw the games of the Copa and the team, and the other games. Zove saw a Juve, and he saw the most organized one, the one he saw was the strongest. But Morignio, last time when Inter made his own interviews and said that Inter would win, no one said anything. It's possible that every time there is a problem, Morignio must say it himself. He can only say that our Italians didn't have a coach that has opened up. I don't like this, it's not a behavior of a professional player, as he says, to be at the top of the situation. This, in my opinion, is not the case. It's not possible that one can say, no, this year the Lazio wins. No, it's not good because he immediately thinks that there is something below that makes him lose. It means that he is not very intelligent because the demonstration can be very calm, having 40 players of that caliber, I mean, we have understood that one can think because a word of lips can ask him this problem. He said that this year he won the Juventus. But it's a bit absurd. You promised to him this year? At least he won the Juventus, because I also won the game last year. No, last time... I would not want to get it wrong, but last time I was in the Juventus. I was in the first four, but last time it was bad. But this year I think he has two teams to put on the pitch and this year he really made a cover of the players of Adatio for that man there and in my opinion that is the strongest. So the hate says Juventus and Antonio if I'm not wrong Antonio did not often say that Juventus would be the one who would be the first four, I hope you use me if I'm wrong. I had already said that the problem in the youth sector was true. and he was very motivated, everyone was in his place, with the last hit he made he went to cover a small lagoon that he had in defense. I'm going to say that today, between Indira and Juventus, I think they will not play at the end of the game, but we will see who will win. But this year I think more in this Juve because it is a well-formed Juve, square, in the green, I was a young coach, I didn't sleep because I was going to sleep. But the problem is that the young man wins the Scudetto. Guys, you can't dream about it every time. If you had two Scudetto, you would have been in the city, you dream about winning."

Good evening to both of you. Good evening. Good evening. Mr. Avramopoulos is also in Thessaloniki. I will start, Mr. Minister, the news that is being broadcast today in the DIPO, a difference is being made between 5.5 and 6.7%. I think the question is, with all these data, is it possible to decide if you have any plans for the election? If we should have done something important, it means that it was announced. How do we go about the elections? It is a given. It will not be a demoscopation that will show us the way. We have put in front of our vehicles. We have a specific plan for the month that comes. I believe that by indicating and by saying... If you do not want to answer... If you do not want to answer, I accept it. But because the question is specific, and regarding the political position of the We have to govern the state for a quarter of a century, so that no one can be fooled and rule a government from the factory and not the next elections to start the revolution. All of these we live in Greece is one of the problems that the political system has. It is a clear stance, you were in the elections and you put it in politics and in social and in the public. Of course. And it is a question of responsibility. Do you allow me? Yes. As much as the time that the Prime Minister made his decisions, all of you are determined in the first line, We are moving forward to the 4th of October with the full recognition of the difficulties that are faced by the public. The Prime Minister has presented them to his side. I believe that we will be able to improve the Greek society for years to come. We are moving forward to the next generations. I ask, does the previous years, in Europe or elsewhere, the political movement, which is one, is in front of the other, in 5.5, 6.5, 6.7, they give the good today, I repeat, to return within 4 weeks to the game and to win those elections? Certainly, the political times do not show anything like this to help your discussion. However, will you agree with me that in politics, I would like to ask you something specific. And if you allow me, this is a witness, a witness of how things will be resolved after elections. I would like to ask you. I would like to ask you. I would like to ask you. I would like to ask you.

I would like to We are not doing it until now, I leave it for now. What will you do? We are... One, two, three. It is not a very correct question. It is explained. Let's talk about elections and one of the reasons is the economy. Because, as I said, the things and the importance of the budget... We are talking about elections. ...will have to be... Listen, it will have to be... One more reason, Mr. Speaker. Because one of the reasons is... ...what is the other reason? Because the economy is a matter of purpose. Listen, listen. It is not a matter of purpose. It is not a matter of purpose. Two is the main reason, ladies and gentlemen. The first is the strong economic situation that pushes the Greek economy and must be at a very high level. And here is exactly what Mr. Apostolakis has to say. And we too will answer the questions that we are asked. And the public opinion. What is the level of the economy? And the second thing to answer Mr. Apostolakis is that ultimately, you are losing the Greek political life, Mr. Apostolakis, personally, and I don't want to. In a situation where political strife will come to Greece, we have a government. We have a political stance. We have a political stance. We have a political stance. We have a political stance.

Men en god vän som jobbat på Bt är att det fanns kanske en möjlighet att få ett jobb på Bt eftersom det var ett generationsskifte på gång. Visste du vad journalister gjorde då? Eller fick du lära dig ett grund? Jag visste att det var en journalist som gjorde det men det fanns inte i min katalog över tänkbara. I yrken hade jag inte fungerat över. Men jag ringde det här till Fonsamtalet. Jag fick träffa min företrädare, Lumine Larsson. Han bestämde på stört att jag fick en provanställning på två målader. Och sen rullade på. Och sen efter för 18 år sedan 1992 blev vi cheflägt för borosttidning. Hur var tidningssituationen på den tiden? Om du ser 80-talet och framåt, det var större konkurrens på den tiden? Det var större konkurrens på tidningsmarknaden på den tiden. Jag var ju två tidningar, inte 92, men under 80-talet så man –och B.T. som konkurrerade om nyheter och ställning. –Hade du en massa av fällstidningar med egna offziner? –Ja, och egna relationer. Konkurrensen på tinnismarknaden var tuffare än idag. –I dag finns det ingen konkurrens. –Vilken mål spelar ni på tjugonionsbildningen? Det är en starka röst och en starka tidningen i vår år. Vi har arbetat med så som uppdraget ser ut att vara ett organ för det fria ordet. Alltså att öppna mot allmänheten och andra röster att debattera i tidningen. Får du mycket kommentar kring betens roll i samhällsdebatten? Det som står i tidningen har en oerhört inverkan på bråspolitiken. kritik i spalterna tycker sedan om detta så att det är klart att det ligger i det här livets natur att man blir föremål för förständig kritik så länge de kritiska rösterna växlar riktning och så känns det rymdigt och rätt. Du kom så fanns det Setteri och Bly och Heidelberg. Vad kan kalla det för det? Har du varit svårt för tycker du för tidning att kunna hänga –och inga medierna snabba explosionsartade utveckling på it-sidan, visst nu? Nej, det tycker jag inte. Om man tittar i backspegeln har det inte varit svårt. När man har stått i tröskan inför varje teknikskifte– –så har det funnits en nervositet i branschen. Hur ska det här gå? Hur ska vi fixa den nya situationen? Men tror du att Bete kommer att ha en egen TV-kanal? Så småningom. Att tekniken går däråt? Den förändring som man ser i... På den digitala sektorn tror jag att webb-tv, alltså en integrering av tidning och tv på webben, det kommer att bli stort och bra. Det är inte säkert att det blir en traditionell TV-kanal som rullar i Uborås. Alla de här åren var. Vad ger du själv för betyg? Var du varit för en chef? Du har haft ledskärnor, jag vet jag, men har du varit en sådan som har gett fritt framför egna initiativ? Eller har du hållit stenort i redaktionen? Jag hoppas att jag har varit en chef som har gett ett stort spelrum för dem för dem som har fått fått förtroendet att sköta olika delar av redaktionen. Och där har du haft ett arv i i systemet i företaget där arbetsledning och chefskap har byggt såhär på en förtroende struktur. Det är det enda från Torger Värnstad, Maru Nullarsson och du har fortsatt. När jag tog över som arbetsledare så fick jag inte så här specifika institutioner utan fick uppdraget att ta hand om detta. och så vilka skapas i min egen riktning och mina egna förutsättningar för att göra det jobbet. Och så har jag försökt att också dela ut stafattpinnarna till mina nära medarbetare för att ge dem så stort och bra spelrum som möjligt. Vad ska vi göra nu när det slutar? Ja, ska jag för det första skapa ordentligt distans till det här till det här livet. Är man chefreaktör och ansvarig utgivare för en skyldig avvastning så är man ju, lever man ett bundet liv och det ska jag ju ändra på naturligtvis så att jag ska göra andra saker som inte heller har varit möjliga att kombinera med livet som som som chefreaktör för en stor tid. Till sist på måndag kommer Stefan Eklund och Tövsta Fettpinnen. Är det ett medvetet val från tidningens sida att fortsätta den här kontinuiteterna? att en lokal person som är väl förankrad på tidningen och i byten här blir en ny chefredaktör. Det är ett medvetet val att välja Sifan Eklund till till ny chefredaktör. Han kan systemet. Han är väl känd i Borås och han är en mycket mångsidig journalist så att det kommer bli jättebra. Då ska jag ta mycket. Den kommer absolut att komma in över alla timmar på arbetsplatsen. Grattis.

Did you know that you were a journalist in order? Or did you learn a few things? I knew I was a journalist in order, but it didn't exist in my catalog, over time. I didn't have that in mind. I called the phone number and got to meet my predecessor, Rune Larsson. He decided that I had a test-trial on two goals. And then it worked. And then, after 18 years of 1992, we became chief judge for the Boroz newspaper. How was the newspaper situation at that time? If you look at the 80s and the past, there was a greater competition at that time? There was a greater competition at the newspaper market at that time. I had two newspapers, not 92, but under the 80s. The president of the party, and the party that competes with news and news. And then you had a lot of own official news.

Do you get a lot of comments about the Betensvål in the same debate? The criticism in the polls is very sad. It is clear that you are in this nature of life, that you are a target for constant criticism. But the longer the critical voices change direction, it feels calm and right. When you came, there were setters, and by and by Heidelberg, what can you call it? Was it difficult for you, you think, for the newspaper to be able to hang out? Is there any way to make the media faster? No, if you look at the back-spawn it's not that hard. When you've been in Trösken every technical shift, there's a nervousness in the fuel. How will this work? How will we fix the new situation? Do you think the BTE will have its own TV channel? The technology will work. The change you see in the In the digital sector, I think that web TV, integration of time and TV on the web, will be big. It's not sure that it will be a traditional TV channel that runs in Uroås.

It's the only one that's been passed on to you, Maru Nullar, as you have continued. When I took over as a work leader, I didn't get specific instructions, but I got the job to deal with this. I created my own direction and my own conditions to do the job. I have also tried to share the benefits to my fellow workers, so that they can be as big and good as possible. What are you going to do now? If you are a chief actor and you are responsible for a protection of the law, you live a bundled life. I will change that of course. I will do other things that have not been possible combined with the life of a chief actor. that a local person who is well-off in the newspaper and in the building, becomes a new chief editor. Yes, it is a well-known choice to be chosen by Stefan Eklund for the new chief editor. He is well-known in Borås and he is a very multi-seated journalist. So it will be very good. They will be here in a few hours."

O tratamento domiciliar no Brasil ainda é pouco conhecido e divulgado. No entanto, essa dinâmica é mais barata para o governo e traz mais qualidade de vida para os pacientes, que podem desfrutar do aconchego da família. Na busca para conhecer quem são e como vivem esses pacientes e seus familiares, André François produziu o livro e o video documentário De volta para casa -- Um documentário sobre o tratamento domiciliar no Brasil.  Para saber mais sobre o documentário e sobre a ImageMagica, acesse: http://www.imagemagica.org.br/portal/index.php/trabalhos-e-projetos/de-volta-para-casa/  ---  The home care in Brazil is still little known and publicized. However, this possibility is cheaper for the government and brings better quality of life for the patients, who can enjoy the warmth and cosiness of their family. In order to know who they are and how they live, André François produced the book and the video documentary Back Home -- A documentary about home care in Brazil.

Que é outra guerra. Esse aparelho ele consume muita energia. É muito caro, é despedioso. Então uma coisa é eu entregar para você e falar assim, olha, esse aparelho aqui vai salvar sua vida. Eu te dou o aparelho. E uma outra situação, é eu ter condições de sustentar esse aparelho. Em condições de fazer uma internação prolongada, essas que é a idade dos hospitais são de pequeno porte, a nossa é a idade brasileira, hospitais pobres, de pequeno porte que não tem condições de manter custo, de manter um paciente internado. Então o tratamento domiciliar vai resolver o problema de muita grande maioria de município brasileiro. Assim como investiram muito no SAMU, hoje o SAMU presta seus serviços, bem, né? O seu espaço, eu acho que a internação domiciliar tiver esse investimento resolve muito desafógico para o seu povo. O curso da internação, o hospitalar, ela supera muito da internação domiciliar. Conta, leve a consideração a medicação, leve a consideração os profissionais, leve-me com as consideração toda a hotelaria, a hospitalar que existe, né? Que é água, luz, roupa, roupa limpa, no profissional 24 horas, e no caso, Você é muito maluco!","The home treatment, this patient needs at least the medication, the food and the hygiene, for example. The hygiene. Which is another war. This device consumes a lot of energy. It's very expensive, it's expensive. So, one thing is me giving you, saying, look, this device here will save your life. I gave you the device. And another situation, is to have the conditions to support this device. In conditions of doing a prolonged internazion, these are the facilities of our small port, the Brazilian facilities, poor facilities, that have no conditions to maintain the cost of having an internal patient. So the treatment of the abyssal will solve the problem of the vast majority of the Brazilian police. As well as investing a lot in the saloon, today the saloon is almost available, I think that if the hospital had this investment, it would solve the problem of the hospital. The hospital is very well equipped with the hospital. Take care of the medication, the professionals, take care of the hotels that exist, such as water, light, clothes, clean clothes, 24 hours in a day. I'm going to take a shower."

Det finns mycket få vetenskapliga artiklar som behandlar ämnet men det finns en hel del examensarbeten, skrifter och rapporter som tyder på att det finns en bred kunskapsbas men därifrån har gått vidare till vetenskapliga studier. Det är väldigt lite gjort. men så länge är tid så planerar jag en sent medel. Och att man ska titta på det här med självständighet av autonomi när man förskriver. För det kan få betydelse för förskrivningsprocessen. Hur man ska göra bäst. Vad händer sen då? Efter den här litteraturstudien. Det har ju hänt säkert en hel del. Jag har inte hunnit göra, har inte heller haft gifta att göra fler sökningar. Om att hjälpmedelsinstitutet har gjort en kartläggning av hjälpmedel inom handikapablittering har man haft ett projekt som handlar om kognitiv stöd för barn. Båda de två har resulterat i ett kartläggningsmaterial eller skrifter som beskriver de här kartläggningarna. Och på nästa bild finns det lite tips om vad man kan läsa mer när det gäller dem. uppsats och då gick jag vidare. Jag ville ju ta reda på lite mer om delaktighet i försvinningsprocessen och i användningen. Så det ska jag berätta kortkort. Här var hjälpmedelsinstitutets kartläggning av kognitiva hjälpmedel. Vad man kan få ta på det och kan det kapabiteringsprojekt kognitiv stöd för barn. Hjälpmedelsinstitutet gjorde då en land som fattade kartläggning av kognitiva hjälpmedel där personal från landets 21 hjälpmedelscentraler Fick beskriva, fick svara på en del frågor om vilka som får kognitiva hjälpmedel. Hur kunskapen för förskriva ser ut vad det gäller kognitiva hjälpmedel. Och vilka hjälpmedel som förskrivs mest. Kort kan man säga att det ser väldigt olika ut i landet vilka kognitiva hjälpmedel som får förskrivas som hjälpmedel. Det är också så att man beskriver att inte alla som har har behov av kognitiva hjälpmedel får det. Men om man ska se att det är någon grupp som får mer vad det gäller kognitiva hjälpmedel så är det personer med utvecklingsdördning. Grupper som har andra kognitiva svårigheter som till exempel ADHD eller Aspergysyndrom eller förvärvade anskador där kunskapen om kognitiva hjälpmedel ännu mindre om man tror att det är ett skäl till att de får sämre tillgång till kognitiva hjälpmedel. Därmed inte sagt att det är tillräckligt egentligen för någon grupp. Vi tittar på mitt lilla kognitiva stöd. Mycket tio handlar. Jag gjorde fortsatt med en maistruppsats där jag var intresserad av just det här med delaktigheten i både hela förskrivningsprocessen och i användningen. Det blev en kvalitativ studie och jag intervjuade tio personer med lindrig utverkningsdörning som hade fått ett kognitivt hjälpmedel. förskrivet under det senaste året. Kortkort om resultatet när det gäller förskrivning processen. Det här med att kartlägga behov, få ett hjälpmedel, introducera det och så vidare. Så upplever personen att de var mest delaktiga början. De beskriver att det var så viktigt med att ha ett möte. Ett möte där man själv får berätta, prata där man blir lyssnad på. De beskrivit ingenting om specifika anpassningar för att de lättare skulle kunna komma ihåg och komma på vad de behövde hjälp med. En bara att bli lyssnad på och att vara en viktig person var viktigt. Alla hade inte erfarenhet av det. I slutet av förskoinningsprocessen när det handlar om att faktiskt introducera hjälpmedlet och göra uppföljningar, då känner de sig mindre delaktiga. Inte säkert att de får prova hjälpmedlet innan. Ibland får man det i bland inte. De beskriver väldigt lite att de har kontinuerliga uppföljningar eller stöd med den som har förskrivit. Men det ser väldigt olika ut i upplevelsen av delaktighet. Sen kan det ju faktiskt vara så att en del uppföljningstillfällen faktiskt har funnits, men personerna inte kommer ihåg det. Eller det har inte gett så stort intryck så att de har upplevt att de har haft. Hur är det då i vardagsaktiviteter? Använda faktiskt hjälp med lite i alla livs situationer i just den här studien, inte bara hemma. Den största delen anser att om man blir mer delaktiga i aktiviteterna de önskar eller behöver utföra och många känner att de behöver ha ha mycket stöd för att komma ihåg och komma på saker, komma på att börja med saker och ting. Och då uttrycker en person så här att det är mycket sköna att få hjälp av den där apparaten hand in. än en chat i mamma. Eller chat i personal. Det gav en positiv påverkan på roller och hälsa. Flera av de här personerna beskriver att de har fått en ändrad roll. Frånan med en barnroll till en mer vuxen roll. Därför att de själva har mer kontroll och kan själva hämta med information om när och hur de ska göra saker och ting. De mår bättre. De beskriver det som att förhade jag svont i magen. Jag hade så ofta ont i huvudet och jag var jätterolig. Vad är jag inte det längre? Men delar att det heter begränsas av olika sociala hinder. Dels omgivnings inställning till dialaktighet. Får man bli dialaktig? Får man bli självständig? Kan vi släppa på makten som personal och anhöriga? Det är sånt som personerna och jag intervjuade tar upp som problem att de får vara självständiga. Jag delaktiga och använda sitt hjälpmedel en del situationen men inte andra. Delaktiga att den begränsas också av de egna sina egna och andras att det tyder till hjälpmedel och där vill jag svara på din fråga. De flesta ser det som en en en viktig och bra sak som man har fått till stöd och hjälp. Men en del tycker att det är pinsamt. För att andra har inte det här. Det är inte många som tycker det. Någare har tagit upp det och då väljer man att inte använda en del situationer. En del fler personer i faktiskt nämner faktiskt istället då att det är så jobbigt att mamma och pappa tycker att det är så jobbigt att jag behöver ha ett hjälpmedel. Så när jag åker hem till dem, då tar jag inte med mig mitt hjälpmedel. Så det finns många varje antal relevationer på det här temat. Hur faktiskt sociala hinder kan begränsa delaktighet? Ja. Slutklämmen på någon minut. Kognitiva hjälpmedel är ett nytt område och det finns fortfarande väldigt mycket kvar att utforska. Jag ser det som ett stort berg med en topp. Toppen har vi. Den där endaste lilla artikeln som jag hittade än så länge men det ska väl bli fler och det kanske har blivit fler. Men det finns en väldigt bred kunskapsbas och det känns väldigt viktigt att flagga för att även det här är ett område där vi behöver få faktiskt här reda på mer. Där har ni mina kontaktuppgifter om ni är intresserade av att ta kontakt. Är det någon minut kvar om det är någon fråga?","The conclusion is that there are many scientific articles that deal with this topic. But there are some examinations, writings and reports that indicate that there is a broad scientific base. But from there, and has gone further to scientific studies, it is very little.

I will tell you about that in a short time. This was the Institute for the Care and Pregnancy of the Cognitive Care. What can be taken into account? And can the Cognitive Support Project for children be able to do so? The Institute of the Care and Pregnancy of the Cognitive Care made a land-saving care of the Cognitive Care. Where staff from the country's 21 Cognitive Care Centre I was asked a few questions about what cognitive aid is available, how the knowledge for the describe the cognitive aid, and what is the most described aid. In short, it looks very different in the country what cognitive aid is described as a aid. It is also described that not everyone who has a cognitive aid is a cognitive aid. need cognitive help, they get it. But if you want to see that there is a group that gets more of cognitive help, there are people with a disability. Groups that have other cognitive difficulties, like for example ADHD or Asperger's syndrome or affected people, where the knowledge of cognitive help is much less, and you think it's a waste of time, they get worse access to cognitive help. I didn't say that it was enough for any group. I look at my little cognitive support. A lot of time has passed. I continued with a master's degree where I was interested in this with the participation in both the screening process and the application. It became a qualitative study and I interviewed ten people with a lint-free expression that had gotten cognitive help. in the last year. Shortly after the result, when the process of registration was carried out, with the need to get help or introduce it, people were most concerned at the beginning. They described that it was so important to have a meeting. A meeting where you yourself can tell, talk, where you are listened to. They don't describe specific changes, because they could easily remember what they needed help with. Just being listened to and being an important person is important. Everyone didn't have the experience to do that. In the end, when it comes to introducing the help-medicine and making up-falls, they feel less active. They're not sure they can try the help-medicine before. Sometimes they do it in a very short time. They describe very little that they have continuous follow-up or support with the one who has been described. But it looks very different in the experience of the dialogue. Then it can actually be that a part of the follow-up case has actually been found, but the people will not be able to keep it. Or they haven't had such a big impression that they have experienced that they have had. How is it in everyday activities? It's actually helpful in all situations in this study, not just at home. The biggest part is that they have become more involved in the activities they want or need to perform. Many feel that they need to have a lot of support to remember and come up with things. Come up with a start with things. Then one person expresses that it's much nicer to get help from the apparatus, the handyman. than a chatty mother. Or a chatty staff. It gave a positive impact on roles and health. Several of these people describe that they have had a different role. From a child role to a more adult role. Because they have more control. And maybe they have more information about when and how they are going to do things. They are better. They describe that they had a stomachache. I was so often in the head and I was so much fun. What is it no longer? I want to share and use my help, but not the others. It is also limited to their own and others' attitudes to help. Most of them see it as an important and good thing that they have been given support and help. But some think it is a waste because others do not have it. There are not many who think so. Some have taken it up. Some people actually mention that it is so hard for a mother and father to think that I need a help. So when I go home to them, I don't take my help with me. There are many variations on this topic. How can social hindrance limit the number of people? The last minute of the lecture. The cognitive aid is a new area. There is still a lot to be done. I see it as a big mountain. With a top. The top we have. The only small article I have found so far. But it may have become more and more. But there is a very broad scientific base. It feels very important to flag for this area where we need to go. I'm actually here to help you. There you have my contacts and letters if you are interested in taking contact. Is there any minute left if there are any questions?"

Mr. Hong Seung-kyung, please come out. Please send a message. I am very happy to meet you all today. Of course, there is nothing to think about, but when you think about it as a whole, I think that success is great. In fact, all the North Korean people in South Korea have been informed about the origin of the North Korean. It is also a great pleasure to hear the news of the North Korean people coming to Korea. As a result, young people in South Korea are changing, and the North Korean people are saying that the basic of the Korean Peninsula is the origin of the North Korean people. We are hoping to support the Korean people and the Korean people as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and as a leader and As Kim Sung-wook said, the North Korea has not yet passed the law that the North Korea will oppose the independence of North Korea, which has been destroyed by the Korean War. I hope that you will participate in the campaign of the North Korean National Party, which can express the will of the people of South Korea to fight against Kim Jong Il and the independence of North Korea. I will continue to sing the songs of the North Korean National Party, which is the weapon that can fight with North Korea from now on. I gave you a good impression that this meeting is really a treasure and that we have hope and a future. I hope and hope and hope and promise that the North Korean people will do their best to make this meeting happen."

Und wir müssen schauen, dass wir das Ding hier gewinnen und der Rest liegt leider mal nicht in unserer Hand. Und als ich dann über das Ziel gefahren bin, kam er an den Funk und hat gemeint, okay, dann dachte ich schon, scheiße, jetzt hat es nicht gereicht. Sag mal, jetzt ist es scheiße? Ja, das sagt man überall in Deutschland. Und, ja. Dann dachte ich schon, im ersten Moment hat es nicht gereicht. Dann kam er doch und hat gesagt, wir müssen die Reihenfolge abwarten. Als er den Funk aufgemacht hat und die Plätze durchgegangen ist und zum Ende geschrien hat, Weltmeister, dann ist er erst mal stehen geblieben. Dann weiß man gar nicht, wie man sich verhalten soll, wie man sich fühlen soll. Dann kommt es einfach aus einem Reich. Seine Augen strahlen. Sebastian, wie ist es? Du bist jetzt in einer Riege in Deutschland im Sport aufgerückt, auf Augenhöhe. Wie wirklich oder unwirklich ist es für dich? Das ist ein komisches Gefühl. Man weiß nicht, wie man sich da verhalten soll. Das ist die Zeit, die man hat für sich, wo man anfängt zu verstehen, was das jetzt bedeutet. Auch das Echo ging direkt zurück, kurzer Stopp in München, dann weiter nach Salzburg, dann nach England und dann wieder zurück in die Wüste. Auf jeder deutschen Zeitung auf der ersten Seite war mein Gesicht. Was gut ist, sei da hingestellt. Aber es ist schon ein bisschen schwer, das dann im ersten Moment zu fassen. Weil ich mein letzten Endes bin ich ein ganz normaler Buu. Wie alle, die hier auch sind. Alle kommen aus Heppenheim und ja, ganz normal aufgewachsen. Ich glaube, das Wichtige ist aber, dass man im Endeffekt so bleibt, wie man ist. Also, Heproma. Sebastian, gerade, was du auch sagst, wie bleibt man? Wie hebt man nicht ab? Was hast du dir selber vorgenommen? Was willst du nicht machen? Ich glaube, wir sind alle hier ganz normale Leute und überhaupt nicht abgehoben. Das ist ein ganz normaler Städtchen. Ich glaube, das kriegt jeder mit in die Wiege gelegt, dass er bodenständig ist. Bleib, wie du bist, Sebastian. Das kann man stellvertretend sagen, was Sie gerade machen. Ich glaube, es ist ein sehr guter Weg. Welche Erwartungen kannst du in Zukunft erfüllen? Das ist die erste Möglichkeit. Die letzte Nacht war die erste, wo ich wirklich geschlafen habe. Und so ist das aber manchmal. Manche Leute teilen dann Kritik aus. Das ist auch so auf der Rennstrecke. Weiß nicht, wenn ich die Kiste versenke. Dann gibt es Leute, die dann da, was weiß ich, alles reininterpretieren und sagen, Mensch, jetzt hat er alles hingeschmissen. Jetzt hat er es falsch gemacht. Letzten Endes meist man selber immer im Bild. Ich glaube, das ist unter dem Strich, dass man mit sich im Reinen ist und sich abends ins Bett legen kann und gesund und gut einschlafen kann. Dafür vielleicht auch noch mal Applaus. Sie haben es gehört. Die erste Nacht, die letzte Nacht, die er überhaupt erst mal geschlafen hat und schon ist er hier in Sonntag und präsentiert sich als Sohn der Stadt hier in Hepmheim. Sebastian, blicken wir sportlich voraus. Ich habe es eben schon gesagt, als einziger Spitzenfahrer so fleißig gewesen, zwei Tage zu fahren. Sie sind so gepolt, eigentlich könnt ihr gar nicht genießen. Bei dir rattet schon wieder das Gehirn 2011. Operation Titelverteidigung. Ist das schon auf der Agenda? Ja, aber im Moment genießt man den Erfolg dieses Jahr. Sowohl ich als auch das ganze Team in England und so weiter. Für ganz Red Bull ist das etwas Unheimlich Großes. Das dürfen wir jetzt auch erst mal genießen. Er hat keine Lust. Hier steht als Beispiel so viele Leute vor sich hat und so begrüßt wird, dann muss man das genießen. Im Moment bin ich wirklich sehr glücklich, wo ich bin. Von klein auf zusammen mit Red Bull und jetzt Weltmeister zu werden, sowohl in der Fahrermeisterschaft als auch Konstrukteurweltmeisterschaft, ist etwas ganz Großes. Da ist man sehr stolz drauf. Von daher fühle ich mich sehr zu Hause und habe es nicht vor, die Farben zu wechseln. Im Moment bin ich glücklich. Das sieht man. Sebastian ist eine fettel Ära so wie es eine schumacher Ära gab möglich ist das so auch ein ziel von dir mit einem team jetzt Serien Siege Serien weltmeisterschaften einzufahren Ich glaube was der michel damals erreicht hat war schon einzigartig natürlich strebt man sowas an und sowas ist das ziel aber ich glaube da kommt dann wieder der Satz dass man erstmal die füße auf dem boden lässt sind sie Schritt für Schritt Das ist Ferrari Rot. Das ist für die Zukunft. Die hat Stefano Ducani-Kali, der Teamchef von Ferrari, schon geschenkt. Da ist er schon. Daher lässt man die Füße am Boden und lässt jetzt erst mal alles auf sich zukommen. Dann schaut man weiter, wie es in der nächsten Saison läuft. Einige Dinge ändern sich wieder an den Autos. Es wird schwer. Die anderen wollen einiges Leben nicht leichter machen. Wir wollen es fliegen lassen. Ich glaube, Sie drücken mir den Daumen.","I knew from the beginning that we wouldn't be leading the championship. We had to win the game and unfortunately the rest didn't fit in our hands. When I crossed the goal, I came to the point and thought, ok, I'm done with this. I said, ok, I'm done with this. I thought, at first, I didn't think it was enough. Then he came and said, we have to wait for the full line. When he opened the radio and went through the seats, he was the world champion. Then he was standing there for the first time. You don't know how to behave, how to feel, and then you just get out of the car. His eyes shine. Sebastian, how is it? You are now in a rye in Germany, in sport, on the top of your eyes. You shake your head, but it's a sport held, born. How real or unreal is it for you? It's a very strange feeling, you don't even know how to behave. It's the time you have for yourself, where you start to understand what it means. I went back to Munich, to Salzburg, to England and back to the desert. To see that on every German newspaper on the first page was my face. It's hard to catch it in the first place. I'm a normal guy like everyone else. I'm from Heppenheim and I grew up normally. I think it's important to stay like that. How do you lift up? What do you expect from yourself? What do you want to do? I think if you know who the people are, in the close environment where you come from, then we are all normal people here and we are not raised at all. I think everyone is involved in the way that he is always on the ground. What expectations can you expect in the future? Some things just don't work out. Today is Sunday, I couldn't get out of here. That was the first time I slept last night. But that's how it is sometimes. Some people criticize. That's on the racetrack. If I lower the box, some people interpret everything. They say, man, you threw everything away, you did it wrong. I think that's the bottom line. That you can get in and sleep well and healthy in the evening. You are so polled, you can't really enjoy it. In 2011, you were the head of the team. Is that on the agenda? Yes, but at the moment we are enjoying the success of this year. I am the whole team in England and so on. I think it's a great thing for Red Bull. I have to say, I will continue in a second. Here are so many people who are so welcomed, I think you have to enjoy it. Sebastian, of course, a lot of shoulder-clops have been seen in Abu Dhabi. Team leaders who suddenly look around and then prefer to be obliged. Mercedes, Ferrari, everyone wants you. What can you say? Do they all have to wait? With Schumi together next week at the Race of Champions, but in one team Next year, you won't be with me, right? At the moment I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to be a world champion, both in the driver's and in the construction. It's something very big and I'm very proud of it. I feel very at home from that. I'm happy to be here. Sebastian, is there a fatal era as there was a shoemaker era? Is that also a goal of you with a team now to win series, to enter series championships? I think what Michael reached at the time was already unique. Of course you turn on something like that and that's the goal, but I think there comes the sentence again that you first let your feet on the ground and step by step. That's for the future. We have to let it fly again next time."

Äntligen är det dags. Vi kör en 8 november på Hotel Tyresand. I år handlar det om handeln och framtidsförutsättningar. I bild är det att man blir tvungen att involvera... Vi har två jättespännande föredrag av Mikael Adylén. Vi har Troedsson som ger sin syn på framtidens utveckling. –för att ge sin syn på hans utveckling och förutsättningar. Jag ska prata om nåt som ligger varmt om hjärtat. Det är framtidens betalningar. –Väl ett intressanta sak. –Ja, jättespännande. Vi är nöjda med programmet. Det visar hittills deltagare och anmälare. Vi är redan i dag över 200 anmäl. Jag vill puffa lite grann för er som har tänkt– –och är nog inte anmältare att anmäl er till årets näringslivsdagen. Det kommer ett fantastiskt spännande. Vad tycker du är det viktigaste mådets program? Det viktigaste är att vi ska se möjligheterna för hamstadshandel– –och totala handel att samverka– –att utmana de olika typerna köpcentrar som finns runt omkring– –och hur vi gemensamt kan enas om bra aktivitet– –som stärker utvecklingen i hamstadshandel. Hur anmellar man sig? Man går in på Swedbanks kontor i hamsta, i Oscarström– –och pratar med namnsta medarbetare som har färdig anmeldning. det finns också även en möjlighet att gå in på nätet.","Thomas, now you are really together for Sweden's nearest livestock 2012. Tell us. I'm very happy to be part of this programme. We are already signing over 200 papers today. I would really like to give a big thumbs up for those who have thought about it. I'm not yet sure if I'll be signing until the end of November. It will be a great exciting project. What do you think is the most important in the Mårds programme? The most important is that we see the possibilities for the HMH and the total HMH to work together to challenge the different types of large shopping centres around the area and how we can be a common source of good activity that strengthens the development of the HMH. How do you apply? You go to Swedbanks Contour in HMH or Oskarsström and talk to the most experienced employees who have finished the work. There is also a possibility to go online."

En dat is de uitdaging die we elke keer weer zoeken. En dat doen we dan de laatste, allemaal ook met hulp van een noek, die jullie inmiddels al bekennen om dit soort dagen te organiseren. Het is een gezond opnicht van mensen uit het doelgroep, mensen die zich aan het orienteren zijn in het doelgroep, of zij iets betrokken vanuit de overheid, dan wel om even de insculatie op te doen. De korte presentatie is een turbo dag. We zullen onze kei hard nodig hebben. Dus we hebben een korte presentatie. De dampar en de padel van de bongerd. De wastafels kwamen in de Saniterfbouw te gaan. En zo is het begonnen. Ik had een schaaltroze om daarna weer op te ruimen. Dat is ook weer gelukt. Dat gaat door naar de volgensie. Want we doen het snel. Nu, aan al 2010. 18.5 hectare in de exportatie. exclusief onze omstelling. Dat hebben we nu als campingpark in Expatatie. We doen er ongeveer 100.000 overnachtingen. We hebben de tweede boten, de Dachetractie, die bekend staat als een regionale Dachetractie waar de campinggast gebruik vermaakt. Dus niet anders hoor, eigenlijk van camping. 100.000-15.000 bezoekers en we hebben op dit park een drie-restaurant helpen van 50.000 mensen per jaar vertoegen. Op veranderen zaken in onze bedrijfsvoering, wat wij niet op maar wat we in het land en in de bransvoren is dat we alles in eigen beheden van bewerpte op explicatie alles wat u vandaag ziet komt uit onze eigen creatieve keuken gedaan Wilde is erg bepaald in de style en wij zijn er wel eens heel bezelf op creativiteit, maar wij kunnen hem hier niet vertalen wij hebben een partners voor een van de partneren aanwezig is de ontkeurna die verteld dat wij tussen onze oren hebben die tekenen die ontwerpte het maar de basis die we ook nog verdienen en het eigen beheer staat ook op de geval. Alles wat we doen is in eigen beheer. Van rieter tot bewaging tot entertraining tot horeca, webdesign, alles. Wij zijn echt het doel zelf dus daarmee wel met die van op de 20 meiweken is die we in principe allemaal in eigen beheer doen. We worden omgeleid, getraind worden, gekleed worden, er geschoot worden en dat is in principe al een busse akward. We doen het voor de Nederlandse markt. Een duitse die binnenkomt is welkom, maar hij wordt in het Nederlandse groet. De website van de Geen Duitser en herkend van de ATHC verricht ons op de Meeuwenzijn markt. Waarom? We kunnen het overleven, we kunnen het verdutpen, bovenin veel kere sterker maken. Het ententeen zoals u nu net zag is een taal energie, een vitale, of een zetterbollet. We kunnen het bedreven, daadwerkelijk veel kere sterker maken door een medetieven, smaller, doel, doel te kiezen. Op van alle zaken technatiseringen gaat vandaag een van de vantieen op ons markt. Het is een klein bedrijf, in een grote organisatie, een grote park is heel moeilijk. Vorig week hadden we helaas geen normatie met valt-of-afval, maar daar moet je niet voor weg lopen. Daar moet je bovenop zitten. De mensen moeten niet voor aangezet begeleiden, daar moet je begeleiden met de indiaïde buren zijn. En dat is een hele politiek taak. Maar ook als de meisje daar voor het trampolien afval, moet je de organisatie zo lang inbedden dat het morgen gaat door meisjes even bezoeken. Een hele belangrijke definitieve metaal consumente voeren. Ik ga mezelf naar de medewerkst toe doen, naar alle zaken, woestertje-ouders, zijn geslapen in de kamer, etc. En op de kleinere te aandacht is heel essentieel om die mensen te laten schitteren op dat kopen, want we hebben het van zoveel lange. En u heeft hem met een stukje vak gezien. Ons live entertainment, daar tussenhoog niet van ons. Daar zijn we gek op, dat doen we graag. En niet alleen voor u, maar dat doen we hier alle dagen in het Hoogseizoen, alle weekend in het Vooringaarseizoen. Maar we zetten hem ook nog breed in, als we het bijvoorbeeld We hebben over onze Sinterklaassoos gekrijgen. In de naart van november 15 versloten soos, voor het breiden in de expressieve huren. En drie opensoos in dit theater. Daar haal je ook al een markt naast toe. In andere attracties die je toen je diepering ook niet doet. Die zijn vanwege want een gezin krijgt je druk. Dat is ook een natuurlijkste. We doen een pakken uit werk en dat soort dingen. En wij hebben een markt naast toe getrokken. 15 eigen geproceseringssoos. En het is erg succesvol. Dat is natuurlijk een blijve entertijd. Het is de endo niet alleen voorandering in het product zelf, dat is gemakseld in de toiletgebouw of in de vlazen. Maar dat kan wel oudeelderig zijn. Maar ook eigenlijk onze innovatie in de communicatie, in de gevoelens die jij op werk na de kwam komt. Uiteindelijk de mond op mond reclamen is heel erg belangrijk. Dat kun je ook mond op mond reclamen en digitaal doen. Dat is een virale markt in campagne. Maar dat kun je ook sturen. Je kunt ook sturen welke verhaal zijn over jou gaan vertellen. In Avan, Zorg is hij niet al, Ellen. Het was in de begin jaren, maar zetten, zetten, zetten. En nu krijg je een co-operation, je kon ze met een schilder bezelig reviews te vertellen over z'n ervaringen. Dat kun je allemaal gaan gebruiken. Want kijk maar naar jezelf. Je zit niet naast elkaar in de zade. Als de buurt van tegen je was, dan zou je terug naar huis gaan. En je wil onderweg wat eten op de dag. Dan kun je daar lekker eten zien. Ja, een rijnhuis. En dan zie je dat voor je zegt dat je hier stopt, dan kan je er lekker eten, want dat heeft mij niet meer van die land te komen. in de dag opkomst. Maar je moet uiteindelijk dat idee ook kunnen uitweken tot een echte onpositie. En heb je wel degelijk ook in gestapen mogelijk. En wat nou het aardig is, daarom vind ik deze definitie eigenlijk zo geweldig. Als je naar het hele kreeg, tijdens de proces kijkt zoals ik dat heel vaak hapteer, dan zit daar een duidelijk scheiding tussen die twee elementen. Je maakt eerst een stukje proces waarin je die fatisie zoveel mogelijk uitgeeft. En er dus ook zoveel mogelijk en daar alleen maar de goede ideeën uit te maken. Om te sturen voor een geweldige video, een video van een minuut, ontstaat een mooi bereich. En die video's die kun je vinden op die website zelf. Je hebt ze ook in een aparte tv-channel geïnflateerd. En ook alle video's die je op YouTube. Dat is niet voor niks. Daar is ook ook goed op naartoe, want dat zal gebeuren. Dat zal gaan reglementen, dus daar zal het duidelijk zijn.","And that is what the people who are still working on it are doing. And also to recognize that something is happening there. And that is the challenge that we are looking for again and that is what I am doing with the last one, with the help of the MOEK, that you will now know to organize these tasks. It is a healthy thing of people from the DOEKOOP, people who are now orientating themselves in the DOEKOOP, or have their own business, from the government, then we will do an inspiration. The tour guide also has a short presentation. It is a turbo day. We will have to hurry. So we have a very short presentation. The damper and the padel of the boomer have been closed. The wash tables have been built in the sanitary system. And that's how it started. I had a scratch when I was cleaning up. And that's also happened. That's because we do it fast. Now, 2010. 18.5 hectares in exploitation. We have now as a camping park in Expatation, we do about 100,000 overnightings. We have the second boat, the Dachetraksie, which is known as regional Dachetraksie where the camping guest is used. So not all of them, actually from camping. Under 50,000 visitors and we have a three-storey hotel in this park, and 50,000 people per year for that. On other things in our business environment, what we do not offer, But what we are doing in the country and in the country is that we are doing everything in our own way, from work to exploitation. Everything you see today comes from our own creative community. Wilma is very involved in the style and we are very much involved in creativity, but we cannot tell her. We have a partner, one of the partners who is a lecturer, who is called Kiona. He tells that we have our ears, he means that he is working, but the basis is that you are doing something with us. The government is also on the ground. Everything we do is in our own way. From retail, to car, to entertainment, to the horticraft, to web design, everything. We do it ourselves. We have a lot of people from the 20th century who are basically all in their own way. They are trained for clothing and for training. And that is all in the bus. We do it for the Dutch market. A German who comes in is welcome, but he is not in the Dutch team. We are a German website with no German recognition of the ATAC. We are aimed at the Dutch market. Why? We can survive, we can do it, above that, make many strengths. The entertainment, as you just saw, is one language and needs to be put into the title. We can make many strengths by making small, big, and big choices. On top of all, the technatization, we will only be able to show it to the public today. If you are a small business, it is very difficult to get a big organization. Unfortunately, the previous week, there was no information about the failure of the agreement. But you have to walk away from that. You have to sit up there. People have to be guided by the agreement. You have to be guided by the agreement. And that is a very political task. But also when the girl is in the middle of the campaign, you have to invite the organization so that tomorrow the girl can visit the girl. Very important, very important, in terms of the management. We have already received our synth and bass shows in November and December 15th. The closed shows for the movement in the exclusive hours. And three open shows in this theater.

And that's also because they do their own work and stuff. And we also bring a lot of attention to that. 15-eyed, chosen shows. And it's a great success for the That's a part of the life of the day. One of the things that young people do over the years is cap up, close and personal. But in the past it was making a claim, that's actually a kind of post-strategy.

It is not only about changing the product itself, like the toilet building or the bathroom, but it can also be a part of it. But also about our innovation in communication, in the field you work on. Ultimately, the motto-monotone clan is very important. You can do that on a digital level, in a viral marketing campaign. But you can also steer it. You can also steer what stories are about you. In the beginning, they were only setting up the tent. Now they get a copy of the consulate's paintings, telling them about their experiences, and they can use it. Because look at yourself, you sit next to each other, as the neighbour, if you go back home. You can't go anywhere, you can't eat there. But you have to be able to express the idea of the real impossible. And you have to be able to understand it. And what is nice about this definition is that if you look at the process, as I often do, then there is a clear difference between these two elements. You first make a piece of process where you give the patient as much as possible. The idea of the city was different. When the mayor came, he said that he would select the big city of the city. And only the good ideas came out of it. Even if it supports a big video, a video of a minute, it's a nice place. And you can find the videos on that website yourself. You can also find them in an apart TV channel. And also all the videos on YouTube. That's not for nothing. There is also a good or bad thing about that. That will be a good lesson for those who are watching."

In the box you have the handset itself and the convenient dock as well as a Porsche Design headset and a full range of travel adapters. And here's the handset itself. As you can see Porsche Design have applied a little magic on this handset so it's a little bit different from the Blackberry Bold that it's based on. But if you put the two side by side you can see they're actually very similar. The layout of connections is the same. The operating system underneath is the same, even if a theme has been applied. But this theme makes all of the icons on the Porsche design handset look a little generic compared to those on the original bold. One thing that we did find was when you were tapping away on the keyboard, it's a little bit too easy to press the convenience key on the side. So you may find yourself launching into the camera when you're trying to type out an email. Another thing that we found about this handset is the back doesn't attach very securely. So it's in place at the moment, but it only takes the smallest tap to separate away from the rest of the phone. If you try getting the back off the original bolt, it's considerably more difficult because you have to really prise it out like that. But other than that, this is very much your standard BlackBerry operating system. Everything else is the same as you would expect. The browser is the same, email, contacts, BBM, you name it, it's exactly the same. But you can't escape from the fact that this is still a phone that costs in excess of a thousand pounds and doesn't necessarily give you the same user experience as a phone half the price.","Hello, this is Chris from Pocketland and today we're looking at the Porsche Design Blackberry P9981.

You are still at the vacation, right? But when the holidays are over, I started thinking about how I can cook well after work, and how I can take care of my children at home, and take care of my children at work. I often plan for this. So I often make some big pot dishes during holidays, even cook rice. And then we put it in the fridge for a while. Because we have a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a good thing called a I can't think of anything else. I just think of the taste of the dream. So you can still make a quick and quick dish. Of course. Like I think the process is important. I like to use a pan in the European border. It can be divided into many layers. You can cook the soup with meat. You can make a white roll with meat. You can also add some vegetables. You can steam the rice and fish. You can cook the rice and fish in 30 minutes. You can cook the rice, soup, fish, meat, and vegetables. The vegetables will turn yellow. No. After you take the vegetables out, you can throw the vegetables away. It's to use the heat to throw them away. Yes. I used to take about 4 or 5 hours to make this dish. I used this time to make this dish. I used this time to make this dish. I used this time to make this dish. I used this time to make this. I used this time to make this. I used to take about 3 or 4 hours to make this. So every time you think about this dish, you are happy. Yes. And I have a lot of time to do other things. I used to prepare and cook for a long time. But today, when you are in a team, you can make the food deliciously. And you can finish the food very quickly. I don't know why, but maybe since childhood, my parents have been very generous to us. Maybe it's because since childhood, the material is more ordinary. You can't eat food outside. It's just that mom cooked it herself. So that night, I was going to watch a film. I made it with Italian bread. Inside, it's just a simple cheese slice. Then it's baked. Then 10 minutes, the cake is so delicious. Yeah, that's right. Like you said, I'll give you a tip. Sometimes you can fry some onions, and then add some pepper. If you have chicken steak at home, you can put it in the fridge. Because it's really delicious when you put it in the fridge for 2-3 days. Like the cake you just baked, right? You put the fried onions on top, and then the red pepper, and the pepper, and put it in. Then the chicken and cheese, put it in, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese, and then the cheese So we don't have to say that there are a lot of you. The ones you drink are really hard to handle. That's right. And like now everyone is busy. Try to think about what kind of food will make the family eat healthier and faster. Actually if you don't buy it, you can ask me. I'm very willing to share. Do you know? I have a good friend who is about the same age as us. He bought a luxury. A apartment is more affordable. And then it's just her durian table Only durian table She has already reached the standard of rice qiling But three or four million of the除去部系下去 durian table and the central party She has three years without a typhoon This is my great style Anyway, in our Wuyi Fishing Lesson era Our mother is squatting in the stove You're like a fire, right? Yes, I've seen this before. Then the big fire Then the grass to eat us And it's like you Mom is great She is very considerate of our taste So she will put rice and meat and vegetables in the steamed bun So anytime you can eat hot food No, I remember when I was a kid We also ordered the rice ball Yes, we just warm it for a whole day So sometimes you go home at 1 o'clock Sometimes we go home at 2 o'clock You are hungry at any time You open the steamed bun You have rice and vegetables and everything Yes, so happy So you are actually The way to change the way to eat is the same as the process of focusing on the food. When the child is sick, the family is sick, we have to go to the hospital. The whole time is already busy, you still have to go to the hospital. This time is gone. Then we why? It is said that we clearly know that healthy diet is very very important. Why don't we go to do it? And it's really not difficult. As long as you are interested in doing it, it's all very simple. We hope that the children are the best home-made quality. Of course we also have the healthiest memory. Thank you very much, Iris. You're welcome."

We need to talk about internal fairness. Like what we just mentioned, is the same-工 equal to the same-sale? Different-工 is equal to the same-sale. But the same-工 is equal or different-工 is equal. These will trigger some internal justice. Next, the mechanism is like what we just talked about. You have to make it in the workplace to meet your needs.

This is part 1 of a 2 part series.","condition, nutrition, management, cattle, beef, BCS",21573,48,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/o17-PwMM9mA.mp3,"Body condition scoring may be one of the most practical management tools that we have available to us in the cow-calf industry today. It's a very simple, subjective visual appraisal system. The system that's widely accepted is a scoring system from one to nine, where one is extremely, extremely thin, typically associated with some kind of either malnutrition or a health concern. On the other end of that spectrum is a nine which most of us would recognize as a very obese typically some production issues there as well probably hasn't calved in quite a period of time or maybe has just taken very very well very very good care of in terms of nutrition. The most important scores on the 1-9 system typically are from about body condition score 3 to about a 6 or 7. We know again based on tons and tons of research we know that these cows need to be in a body condition score 5 at calving if we hope to maximize their chances of rebreeding and calving again in a 365 day interval. It's not economically, if we wait until cows are already in lactation with the calf at side, it's not economically feasible to appreciably change body condition score because we know that's a period of highest nutrient demand in that cows' annual production cycle. So as we look at some of these cows here today, I think the way that the places I look, certainly as I appraise these cows, I think we want to look and And the way I teach the system is if you look at a cow and you see ribs, we're thinking body condition score four or less. If I look at a cow and I see no ribs, I'm thinking body condition score five or greater. I think the other places that we assess condition, we can look in the brisket for the, for distention or fat net position in the brisket. Certainly we can look over those ribs. Again, as I've already mentioned, if I look at a cow and see no ribs, I'm thinking a five or greater. If we see ribs on those cows and typically those ribs will be to become visible as you move from the last rib or the 13th rib towards the shoulder. If we look there and see that 12th or 13th rib, the rest of them are covered, we're thinking a four, maybe less. We can look down that top line and how well covered their vertebra are. If we see sharpness down the top line, those transverse vertebral processes sticking up, that's a good indication that that cow is probably a four or less. We can look out over those loin edges, the spinous processes of those vertebra, if they're very sharp and flat up over that loin from that between the last rib and the hip. If they're sharp out over those loin edges, again, that's an indicator that that cow's in thinner condition. And then certainly how well covered she is up over her hip from her hooks to her pins, the amount of fat deposition or the thinness around that tail head is a really good indicator and gives us a clue as to where she fits on that one to nine body condition scoring system. We've got a really nice set of cows here today, a lot of diversity in terms of condition and breed type and physiological status. So let's take a look at these cows today and see if we can point out some of the things that we'd look for in terms of body condition scoring this particular set of cows. Let's start with this little brownish black ring-eyed ball-faced cow. Remember that the starting point is, at least in my opinion, the starting point is to start with ribs. Do we see ribs or not? I think certainly you can appreciate in this cow. You can see those last two or three ribs. So we're thinking this cow is a four or less. As we look down her top line, she's still fairly smooth down her top line. We don't see those transverse processes of her vertebra sticking up like the fins on a fish. She's got some smoothness and roundness out over those loin edges. She's still got a little cover around her tail head over her hook bones. She's got some cushioning around her pins and a little bit of fat deposition around that tail head. So to me, this cow would fit fairly neatly in that body condition score four. As we look at this little black cow, you can with the white stocking on her left hind leg, a cow that you can certainly begin to see more of a skeletal outline than some of the cows, heavier conditioned cows that we've looked at. You can appreciate the definition between where a neck ties into her shoulder. You can see her shoulder blades beginning to pop up there along her top line. You can appreciate certainly the fact that she's a little sharper down her top line. She does have an extremely high tail set that doesn't necessarily come into play in terms of her body condition. A cow that's beginning to get a little tucked up in her rear flank, she's really neat, clean and tight up there in her brisket. You still don't see evidence of ribs from this angle. A cow that I think, as you consider the tightness and hardness up there in her shoulder, how clean and tight she is in her brisket, she's beginning to get a little tucked up in her rear flank. She's sharp down her top line. A cow that to me is right there on the borderline between a condition score three and four, the fact that we don't see any ribs in this cow, I think we have to call her. If we had to call it one or the other, we'd call her a body condition score four today. Okay, as we evaluate this little black cow, we start and look there for evidence of ribs and I think you can appreciate that you can see those last couple of ribs. So we're thinking body condition score four or less. As we look at this cow, if we want to start on her front end and we appreciate the fact that she's very clean and tied up there in her brisket, her shoulder still got a little bit of cover, a little bit of condition over it. She's still got some condition down that top line. She's got some condition back there around her hook bones. She's beginning to get a little sharp up over her tail head. No evidence of a condition back there in her rear flank. So I think as we consider it all and the fact that we can see those last two or three ribs, this cow is probably in a body condition score of four today. Okay, as we consider this charlotte cow again evaluating her using our primary evaluation tool and again realizing this is a uropanum continental European kind of cow, heavier muslin. We start there at that last rib and I think you can see right there where that color kind of changes on her side. You can see those last two or three ribs. So we're thinking this cow is probably a four or less. You can appreciate that this cow's a little bit harder up in her shoulder. You can see that more definition in her shoulder. She wants to be, you can see the outline of that shoulder a little better than some of these cows that have got heavier condition. You can appreciate that she's beginning to sharpen just a tad down her top. top line. She's got a little bit of draw on her that you can see as she moves away there in front of her hip. She's still got some distention and some fleshiness up over that tail head, up over the top of her hip and around her tail head. But she's certainly beginning to sharpen up over that tail head as well. The fact that we can see ribs, there's no distention up there in her brisket. She's pretty hard and well defined in her shoulder. You can see those last two or three ribs, the sharpness down her top line that's becoming apparent. I think this cow would be pretty solidly right there in a body condition score of four. The bigger Brahmin influence cow there, the ball-faced cow with some white in her underline, I think again as we apply that initial evaluation, we don't see any ribs on this cow, so we're thinking that she's gonna be a five or greater. This cow again very, very smooth up over her shoulder. You don't see any evidence of her shoulder blade there. She's very smooth up over her shoulder, flat down her top line. Again, got some conditioning up around her hook bones, some flesh in there between her and her pins, some fullness around her tail set. She's got just a tad bit of fat you can see there in her brisket. She's certainly not distended in her brisket, but she does have some fat deposition there. So when I look at the fat deposition in her brisket, her smoothness and flatness down her top line, smoothness over her shoulder, the fat deposition up over the top of her hip and around her tail head, and the fact that I don't see any ribs, I would call this cow body condition score of five.","Body condition scoring may be one of the most practical management tools that we have available to us in the cow-calf industry today.

It's not economically, if we wait until cows are already in lactation with the calf at side, it's not economically feasible to appreciably change body condition score because we know that's a period of highest nutrient demand in that cows' annual production cycle. So as we look at some of these cows here today, I think the way that the places I look, certainly as I appraise these cows, I think we want to look and And then the way I teach the system is if you look at a cow and you see ribs, we're thinking body condition score four or less. If I look at a cow and I see no ribs, I'm thinking body condition score five or greater. I think the other places that we assess condition, we can look in the brisket for the, for distention or fat net position in the brisket. Certainly we can look over those ribs. Again, as I've already mentioned, if I look at a cow and see no ribs, I'm thinking a five or greater. If we see ribs on those cows and typically those ribs will be to become visible as you move from the last rib or the 13th rib towards the shoulder. If we look there and see that 12th or 13th rib, the rest of them are covered, we're thinking a four, maybe less. We can look down that top line and how well covered their vertebra are. If we see sharpness down the top line, those transverse vertebral processes sticking up, that's a good indication that that cow is probably a four or less. We can look out over those loin edges, the spinous processes of those vertebra, if they're very sharp and flat up over that loin from that between the last rib and the hip. If they're sharp out over those loin edges, again that's an indicator that that cow's in thinner condition. And then certainly how well covered she is up over her hip from her hooks to her pins, the amount of fat deposition or the thinness around that tail head is a really good indicator and gives us a clue as to where she fits on that one to nine body condition scoring system. We've got a really nice set of cows here today, a lot of diversity in terms of condition and breed type and physiological status. So let's take a look at these cows today and see if we can point out some of the things that we'd look for in terms of body condition scoring this particular set of cows. Let's start with this little brownish black ring-eyed ball-faced cow. Remember that the starting point is, at least in my opinion, the starting point is to start with ribs. Do we see ribs or not? I think certainly you can appreciate in this cow. You can see those last two or three ribs. So we're thinking this cow is a four or less. As we look down her top line, she's still fairly smooth down her top line. We don't see those transverse processes of her vertebra sticking up like the fins on a fish. She's got some smoothness and roundness out over those loin edges. She's still got a little cover around her tail head over her hook bones. She's got some cushioning around her pins and a little bit of fat deposition around that tail head. So to me, this cow would fit fairly neatly in that body condition score four. As we look at this little black cow, you can with the white stocking on her left hind leg, a cow that you can certainly begin to see more of a skeletal outline than some of the cows, heavier conditioned cows that we've looked at. You can appreciate the definition between where a neck ties into her shoulder. You can see her shoulder blades beginning to pop up there along her top line. You can appreciate certainly the fact that she's a little sharper down her top line. She does have an extremely high tail set that doesn't necessarily come into play in terms of her body condition. A cow that's beginning to get a little tucked up in her rear flank, she's really neat, clean and tight up there in her brisket. You still don't see evidence of ribs from this angle. A cow that I think, as you consider the tightness and hardness up there in her shoulder, how clean and tight she is in her brisket, she's beginning to get a little tucked up in her rear flank. She's sharp down her top line. A cow that to me is right there on the borderline between the condition score three and four. see any ribs in this cow, I think we have to call her. If we had to call it one or the other, we'd call her a body condition score four today. Okay, as we evaluate this little black cow, we start and look there for evidence of ribs and I think you can appreciate that you can see those last couple of ribs. So we're thinking body condition score four or less. As we look at this cow, if we want to start on her front end and we appreciate the fact that she's very clean and tight up there in her brisket, her shoulder still got a little bit of cover, a little bit of condition over it. She's still got some condition down that top line. She's got some condition back there around her hook bones. She's beginning to get a little sharp up over her tail head. No evidence of a condition back there in her rear flank. So I think as we consider it all and the fact that we can see those last two or three ribs, this cow is probably in a body condition score of four today. Okay, as we consider this Charleye Cow again evaluating her using our primary evaluation tool and again realizing this is a Eurovision of the top line. She's got a little bit of draw on her that you can see as she moves away there in front of her hip. She's still got some distention and some fleshiness up over that tail head, up over the top of her hip and around her tail head, but she's certainly beginning to sharpen up over that tail head as well. The fact that we can see ribs, there's no distention up there in her brisket. She's pretty hard and well defined in her shoulder. You can see those last two or three ribs, the sharpness down her top line that's becoming apparent. I think this cow would be pretty solidly right there in a body condition score of four. The bigger Brahmin influence cow there, the ball-faced cow with some white in her underline, I think again as we apply that initial evaluation, we don't see any ribs on this cow, so we're thinking that she's gonna be a five or greater. This cow again very, very smooth up over her shoulder. You don't see any evidence of her shoulder blade there. She's very smooth up over her shoulder, flat down her top line. Again, got some conditioning up around her hook bones, some flesh in there between her and her pins, some fullness around her tail set. She's got just a tad bit of fat you can see there in her brisket. She's certainly not distended in her brisket, but she does have some fat deposition there. So when I look at the fat deposition in her brisket, her smoothness and flatness down her top line, smoothness over her shoulder, the fat deposition up over the top of her hip and around her tail head, and the fact that I don't see any ribs, I would call this cow a body condition score of five."

We know historically what some responsibilities are of kings. We know that they're responsible to just take over the land, but then they have to take care of the land. They have to provide for the needs of the people. They have to protect them from enemies from their people. They have to be judges whenever there's disputes. King David did all of these things. As soon as he was crowned king in 2 Samuel, King David built the city up to take care of the people. He built the city of David. He provided for their needs. And then as soon as the Philistines heard that King David had been crowned, then they decided they were going to come attack. And then King David was called to protect his people. And they did. He protected his people from the Philistines and from many other people that were coming at different times to take over his kingdom. And he even was called to be judge over disputes. In 2 Samuel 14 there is a woman who comes to him and he's called King David to rule over this dispute and to say what's right and what's wrong and what needs to happen from then. Kings have responsibilities to provide, to protect, to be judge. But in history we know, no matter what a king is called, that they tend to not be judged. be perfect. That saying absolute power corrupts absolutely. Whenever we get a little bit of power in our hands, we start thinking, what can we do with that? If we were to win the lottery, what are we going to do with the lottery? If we were king over our whole life and could make up all the rules, what would we do with all of that power? King David too also in 2 Samuel 11 sees another man's wife and he would like to have her and he has the power to get her. And so he takes that man's wife to be his and she has conceives and then he has to decide what to do with her husband. He sends her husband out to into mortal danger, into the field, into battle, and he dies. And the whole country suffers. The whole kingdom suffers for something that maybe today we would call that, oh, that's just his personal issues, you know, that's private. David did, having an affair is just private. The whole kingdom suffered for what King David did. No king is perfect. Not one of us. Whether we're a king or we're elected leader or whether we're a religious leader or whether we're a celebrity or somebody that we look up to, nobody that we look up to here on earth can live up to those perfect expectations and certainly not when they're given absolutely power and authority. But Jeremiah was a prophet in the Old Testament. A prophet of the good King Josiah and he said, the days are coming when the Lord's declares that I will raise up to David a righteous branch, a king who will reign wisely. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This will be his name, the Lord our righteousness. Jesus Christ That is the only perfect king. He is the provider in John 6. Jesus says, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry. And he who believes in me will never be thirsty. We don't know what that's like. Here on earth when we struggle, when our president's trying to make sure that everybody has jobs, everybody has healthcare, everybody has food, we can't do that perfectly. Jesus Christ says, I am the bread of life. of life, he who comes to me will never be hungry. He who believes in me will never be thirsty. Jesus is the protector and second Thessalonians says the Lord is faithful. He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. The evil one has no power over those who are protected by Jesus Christ. He is judge, second Corinthians says, for we all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ that each one may receive what is due for him the things done while in the body whether good or bad. We must present ourselves before the judgment seat of Christ. He does these things that kings do the responsibilities of providing our needs, of protecting us, of being judged even over our lives. But what he does differently that no other king or ruler or supreme authority here on earth can do, what Jesus Christ can do is he does it selflessly. without any thought for himself of the power that he wants. Philippians says, and being found in the appearance of man, Jesus humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on the cross. Philippians also says being made in the very nature of God, he didn't just consider equality with God, something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant. Being made in human likeness. He gave up his kingship. He gave up his life. He was completely selfless. For you. For me. For us who if we were given that power we would think about what can I do with this power? What can I do with this little bit of money? What can I do with this little bit of authority? Who can I use? How can I get ahead in life? We think about ourselves all the time. Christ when given full authority you were created to be under his authority. He created you so that he could be your king and then he turns right around and he becomes a servant to you and he dies on the cross for you. We humans if we were this king if we were the ruler we would be corrupt. We would lie. We would cheat. We would be scoundrels. We would be adulterers. Just open up the sports section and we can see people doing that nowadays. We just open up our hearts and we can see that inside of ourselves. So for those of us who are free Americans, who revel in our freedom and our ability to make free choices, to choose what we want to do with our lives, to choose what we want to do on a Sunday morning, to choose what we want to say, We have freedom of speech. We are privileged. We are loved. We have full stomachs. We've warm places to be in in this life. We are without any wants. Yet, do we still want more? Pastor Lockridge asked if you know this King. He asked do you know him? Do you know Jesus Christ, this King who gave up his whole kingdom so that you you who are sinful, so that you who need protection can be protected, so that you who are hungry and don't have your needs met can be provided all your needs. He talked about a king, Jesus Christ, who faces death.","What else do we know about kings as Americans? We know historically what some responsibilities are of kings.

Unfortunately, there was a short period of time for the public to announce what is the support and what is the support. But this, in the end, or in the beginning, is a choice that must be respected or respected. There is a fact that the person who was demanding after the vote to achieve these changes will be punished because these are the first democratic steps. But I will tell you the truth, what are the next steps? After this support and support, and not a small majority. There will be a debate to create a party with just the election, as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, that this will be after the end of the investigation. So, in the coming days, maybe hundreds of parties will be created with just the election. And this is a contest that existed before, that we must see the party of the public or the Supreme Council of the press. There are five parties in Egypt. We will wait for hundreds of parties. This is the first step. There are other steps. The Supreme Court will be preparing parliamentary elections, the People's Congress, the General Assembly, and the presidential elections. The elections will be held in September from next year. The first is the month of August, then the main elections. This is a short period, but this is the transitional period, which is the final period of the armed relations meeting. 6 months or 9 months is the period of the most. This will be the period of the Egyptian election seven or eight times before the election."

Like I mentioned before, drift GP is pretty easy if you know how to get your combos straight, but drift battle is a lot more chaotic because it's not just you on the track, it is a certain number of opposing drivers which makes it a lot more difficult not to crash and to maintain your combos. So I don't know how this is going to work out right now, I'm trying to keep my combo I never use the straights to drift so they usually are faster than you if you drift constantly. This may be problematic but after all it's also not that difficult to win in this game. And yes I'm not using the RX-7 I'm using another car just to bring in some variety. RX-7 is still my favorite drifting car but it's not a reveal that broke the combo here because that was I don't think it's that important right now. I mean I could but I already have 10 million I only won this game. So I'm not really that concerned about having a flawless drift through this. Drift of the Yokohama dogs which is the most fun but also the most difficult drift track in the game. And also looks great graphically because of the sunlight and it's not night time like Shibuya and it's sunset time not just daytime like in Okotama. If you want some nice graphics you can play Yokohama and it's great practice because it's a lot more difficult. It's very unpredictable if you don't know the tracks and Drift Battles chaotic as it is. Not right now because I'm in first place but if you like start and start last it's kind of difficult to maintain you could do it without crashing. See you crash into the boundary seal it's not a big deal. Alright time for lap three. This is gonna be over soon. I mean it's not difficult like I said it's a lot like with GP but a little bit more chaotic. The potential for high points is a lot higher. Like I think on a free lap drift I already beat a hundred million on a perfect combo but it's not hard. It's just more chaotic. Especially online. If you play this one online it is pretty much impossible to not get total during the play. It's barely consistent. Why? Because people are just reckless. Well, of course there's no online multiplayer in this game anymore because the servers are shut down, but you could still play it online with Hamachi. Similar because the local area network game mode is in this game. You can play it online if you are in the same network and Hamachi kind of... What a program does, it makes your computer think it's in the local area network. Enjoying the same and muchy network and pretty much played a game with others online. It's still possible. It's not completely off So this is the end of the race I won easily. I think I won I'm not so sure right now, but I think I did check out the final score here and For tomorrow, I will do GT1 just to give you a little bit more interesting because it's faster cars and it's kind of like the It's the top notch right below prestige where the cars are really fast and the tracks are pretty long. So I want to thank you really much for watching. It's your final score. Tomorrow, like I said, GT1. I'll see you guys next time. Bye-bye.","Hello YouTube, it's GoFansive and today we're gonna do some drift battle. Like I mentioned before, drift GP is pretty easy if you know how to get your combos straight, but drift battle is a lot more chaotic because it's not just you on the track, it is a certain number of opposing drivers, which makes it a lot more difficult not to crash and to maintain your combos. So I don't know how this is going to work out right now, now because like I said it's kind of chaotic and you it's very likely to crash once in a while and fortunately I'm starting on first place so the main difference is okay it's a lot more chaotic and you get more points per flag if you are far ahead so on the first on first place you get maximum 60,000 per flag which is quite a lot so the potential for points I'm trying to keep my combo I don't get overtaken and here it happens. AI never uses the straights to drift so they usually are faster than you if you drift constantly. This may be problematic but after all it's also not that difficult to win in this game. And yes I'm not using the RX7 I'm using another car just to bring in some variety. RX7 is still my favorite drifting car but it's not a reveal that broke the combo here because I don't think it's that important right now. I mean I could but I already have 10 million I only won this game. So I'm not really that concerned about having a flawless drift through this. Drift of the Yokohama dogs which is the most fun but also the most difficult drift track in the game. And also looks great graphically because of the sunlight and it's not night time like Shibuya and it's sunset time not just daytime like in Okotama so If you want some nice graphics, you can play Yokohama and it's great practice because it's a lot more difficult.

Aquí están todas las listas de los juegos. Yo voy a elegir la página número 3 en donde hay un juego llamado Wolfenstein. Es un juego que yo recuerdo mucho haber jugado pero esta es la última parte. Wolfenstein es un castillo Este muchacho que subió este juego aquí puso las especificaciones, dice que es para PC, generó acción primera persona, temática, ciencia ficción, desarrollado por, aquí cuenta la historia, pone unas fotos de su juego. Los requisitos es muy importante, va a ver si el ordenador de ustedes cumple con los requisitos, dice que es una la cpu, puede ser una inter 214 de 3.2 de ahí hacia arriba, la memoria gran necesita un gg, 8 gg después y la tarjeta también gráficas para la cual ustedes pueden jugarlo o no por ejemplo sobre a partir de 256 megabytes o superior y la ATI aquí ponen la marca en los modelos bueno vamos a ver hacia abajo y aquí tenemos los enlaces este muchacho subió 35 partes es decir dividió el juego en 35 partes de 195 megabytes y la que hacemos nosotros? aquí tenemos el gestor vamos a eliminar esta descarga vamos a copiar, notense que aquí el gestor está dividido en tres pestañas, en descarga donde está el centro de la actividad por decirlo así el capturador del lase a donde vamos a pasar ahora y los ajustes nosotros vamos a poner capturador del lase, da lo mismo si queda en la pestaña de descarga, da lo mismo, nosotros vamos a venir aquí a la página Enzombrese los links de la pestaña no hay ninguna equid de color rojo, eso significa que todos los links estarían bien bien porque no nos ha salido ningún enlace caído ahora vamos a pasar a esta pestaña es decir este archivo este juego lo vamos a pasar a descarga para que nosotros podamos comenzar o el gestor comience a bajar este juego como se hace aquí donde dice agregar todos los enlaces le damos clic ahí y fíjense que aquí ya pasamos a descargas entonces vamos a ir vamos a yo les aconsejo que estas páginas de cuando ustedes descarguen una la vean bien por si el cuando termine de descargar las 36 partes y quieran descomprimir a mucha gente y muchos usuarios le ponen clave a el Windrath a dicha descompresión entonces yo les aconsejo guardar esa página en favoritos y ya la pueden cerrar por si tienen que volver a esta página a ver si ustedes tienen algún problema también ahí en esa página salen los comentarios la gente que ya ha bajado el juego entonces ustedes pueden corrobar al juego efectivamente está en buenas condiciones si es el juego si está en inglés o si está subtitulado español aquí ya comienza la descarga está a 640 kilómbres por segundo la velocidad variando ahora van 597 638 etcétera y me dice que en 3 horas 4 horas, voy a tener el juego a mi disposición. ¿Dónde? ¿Dónde va a llegar el juego? Vamos a pasar a la ventana Justes. Vamos a darle clic en descargar descargas y conexión. Yo aquí lo he cambiado. He cambiado mi destino de descarga a apreté seleccionar y yo creé una carpeta en mi escritorio. Esta y le puse j2loader es decir todo lo que que descargue este programa este gestor va a ir a esta carpeta como le asignó el archivo o la carpeta de destino simple le dan seleccionar se le dará una ventana de búsqueda y ustedes le dan clic a la carpeta donde quieren dejar lo descargado o sea películas música entonces este es el gestor de descarga recuerden que son 36 links para no estar clickeando 36 veces metiendo los cuatro códigos en este caso megauplo 36 y mecaupla de este gestor se descarga de descargarme las 36 partes sin yo necesariamente estar metiéndome a la página y clicando 36 veces este es el gestor de descargas entonces le hemos hecho una mirada bastante básica acuérdense que aquí velocidad tiene un número 0 al poner 0 es descarga ilimitada es la mejor configuración cuando ponen cero no es que no descargar es simplemente que están neutros y puede descargar a una velocidad ilimitada bueno a pesar de que mucha gente si le dice eso esto simplemente básicamente el gestor descarga ordena y te facilita la descarga más que agilizártela o acelerártela para eso eso depende mucho de la conexión de internet que tú tengas contratada y si es que tienes otro programa abierto en este caso emule por ejemplo si tuviéramos descargando de emule el jdorlader como emule copa mucho lanche de banda el jdorlader bajaría a mucha menos velocidad entonces yo recomiendo una de dos o descargan de este vejector o descargan de emule o algún programa p2p","Let's learn to download and configure a program called J. Don Loder, who is a manager or administrator of downloads. Basically it is a program designed for two files, for download files from the internet, movies, games, programs, automating the download files to be able to stop them or continue them when you want. of large size and divided into many parts, that is basically that is a manager and a downloader of direct downloads an archive of a game for example that weighs 5 or 6 or 7 gigabytes of size obviously to upload it to the web or a server in this case for example it can be mega upload or rapitcher I have a movie that is ripped off a DVD that is spoken in Spanish and it is from the server is freechair.net are 6 links one of which is active and the total weight is 844.9 megabytes Let's download a download page, free games.org for example. And let's see how this download manager works. Here are all the list of the games. I'm going to choose page number 3. Where there is a game called Wolfenstein. This is the last part. Wolfenstein is a castle. This guy who uploaded this game here, he put the specifications, says it's for PC, first person action, theme, science fiction, developed by, here tells the story, he puts some photos of his game, the requirements is very important, it will see if the computer of you meets the requirements, says that it is a CPU, it can be an Intel 214 or 3.2, from there up, the RAM needs a Gigabyte, 8 Gigabytes you can play it or not, for example, on or from 256 MB or higher and the ATI here put the model in the brand. Well, let's see down and here we have the links, this guy uploaded 35 parts, that is, he divided the game in 35 parts of 195 MB and the audio The last part 14 megabits. What do we do? Here we have the manager. We are going to delete this download. Let's copy. Note that here the manager is divided into three tabs. In download where is the activity center, so to speak, the link capturer where we are going to go now and the adjustments. We are going to put link capturer, it does the same if it is in the download tab, it does the same. We are going to come here to the page.

Well, despite many people saying that, this is simply basically the download manager, it orders and facilitates the download more than to agile it or accelerate it, for that it depends a lot on the internet connection that you have contracted and if you have another open program in this case emule for example if we were downloading emule the jdol lader as emule cuts a lot of bandwidth the jdol lader would go down to much less speed so I recommend one of two or download from this old manager or download emule or some program p2p"

Le prochain grand prix à Louvain qui s'appelle Grand Prix d'Europe. Le Louvain n'est pas un circuit de sable, un circuit d'une terre un peu sable de cercle mais de paire. Alors que le véritable grand prix de Belgique se déroulera plus tard dans le sable à la fin de la saison. Pour Hévertz, il est à remarquer que Hévertz a jusqu'à présent gagné les secondes manches. Lors des trois premiers grand prix, il a gagné la seconde manche en Espagne, la seconde manche au Portugal, la seconde manche en Hollande. On ne sait jamais, dernier tour. peut-être un petit peu plus varié, ça va favoriser les dépassements et ça risque d'être... On en reviendrait presque à souhaiter qu'Evers réalise un mauvais départ. Moins le voir à l'oeuvre peut-être un petit peu remonté et non pas s'envoler comme ça dès le début, comme ça s'est passé ici. Lors de cette première manche, il est vrai un tout petit peu décevant, même si on applaudit des deux mains au tir groupé des Français, la merveilleuse performance de volet, enfin dans les gros points. La cinquième place de Masquio, la sixième de Maria, la septième de Pagel, la neuvième de Betis. Super résultat d'ensemble de l'équipe de France. Le seul problème c'est que un certain Stéphane Emerz, lui n'est pas français, il est belge et en tant que belge il n'aime pas francophone, il est flamant. On l'aime beaucoup Stéphane Emerz mais on aurait bien aimé qu'un français aux Grands Prix de France réussisse à lui faire mordre un petit peu la poussière. Ça semblait bien parti aux essais califs. Et le terrible Stéphane ne l'a pas voulu ainsi. Le numéro 1 mondial quadré plus chaleur du monde, triple champion du monde 250. Le voici près de l'arrivée. Le rapport est amié. Dans quelques mètres pour Stéphane. Le numéro 1 à un petit salut de la main. Un petit willing, voilà. Un doublé donc pour les ondats officiels. Puisque Bollet et Second. Frédéric Bollet qui est un p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit p'tit Il doit être vraiment très très heureux de cette seconde place ici à Villard. Et on est très heureux pour lui. Effectivement. Torquelli 3ème. Et voilà c'est... J'imagine que Sébastien est un peu déçu d'autant qu'il a fait quand même deux fautes de glissade qui lui ont coûté beaucoup de temps et certainement au moins la seconde place. Stéphane qui fait un tour d'honneur avec le drapeau belge comme peuvent le faire les pilotes en formulae. Comme le font les pilotes en grand prix de vitesse parce qu'en formulae ils n'ont plus le droit je crois que désormais La focale, en tout cas, en grand prix de vitesse, c'est une pratique très courante. Sébastien Tortéli 3e, on attend Bayreur 5e derrière Maschio, certainement de Maria 6e et l'incroyable Pagé 7e. Là, en con je suis ici, Stéphane Evers. Pagé 7e, Carlsson 8e, Betis 9e devant Berwoutz, Berwoutz qui, à nouveau, après un bon grand prix de Hollande, on déplace un peu plus anonymes et il n'y a pas d'autre Français dans les points. Le belge 13 à l'aise la semaine dernière, 12e seulement devant Paul Cooper Le jeune anglais Cooper est bien placé. Caillier n'est que 20e, mais c'est pas mal Caillier là. Il était arrivé 20e alors qu'on a vu que Guidetti comme Talon Volland a été contraint à l'abandon. Leon Gisbers aussi, le landais qui est moins à l'aise. Beaucoup moins inusable c'est sûr. Et vert 13 applaudi. Les Français ne sont pas que chauvin ou alors il y a beaucoup de belges autour du circuit. Il avait l'air très confiant après les essais. Il n'était pas du tout inquiet des deux secondes ou presque, qui lui avaient infligé Sébastien Torcalius de ses qualifs. Il était très confiant pour la concebastienne qui quand même fait un tour avec le drapeau français. Sébastien qui, rappelons-le, ne perd que cinq points lors de cette manche par rapport à Stéphane. Il en avait dix de retard. Voilà les trois, le podium, Heverts, Bolet, Tortelli et on retrouve Séphane Heverts. J'ai fait un très bon départ, j'étais en position à l'extérieur sur la grille de départ. J'ai passé Sébastien d'une manière assez agressive dans le premier tour et ensuite j'ai essayé de creuser les cas. Comment a-t-il été le victoire ?","The next Grand Prix in Louvain, which is called the Grand Prix d'Europe, which is precisely the one where Louvain is not a sand circuit, a circuit of a little bit of sand but of a pair, whereas the real Grand Prix of Belgium will take place later in the sand at the end of the season. For Everts, it is to be noted that Everts has won the second World Cup. During the first three Grand Prix, he won the second World Cup in Spain, the second World Cup in Portugal, the second World Cup in Holland, he had three World Cups, The track is a bit dry, the tracks are not good. It will be a little more varied, it will favor the overtakes and it will be possible to be... We would almost come back to the idea that the reverse makes a bad start. The sight of the work may be a little bit up and not without flying like that from the beginning, as it happened here during this first manche. It is true a little bit disappointing even if we applauded the two hands at the French groupings, the wonderful performance of the flying, finally in the big points. 5th place of Maschio, 6th of Maria, 7th of Pagel, 9th of Betis. Great result from the French team. Great result because the 4 official riders are in the top 10 but they are not expected because we had not seen them very fast and we know that Bétis is always there when they have to do well, especially in France. And that Bétis in any condition is able to enter the top 10. But we have 6 French riders, it's not bad. The only problem is that a certain Stéphane Emerz is not French, he is Belgian. As a Belgian, he is not even a Francophone, he is a Flamant. We really like Stéphane Emerz but we would have liked a Frenchman in the French Grand Prix to have him bite his thumb. It seemed well-matched to the Caliphs' tests. And the terrible Stéphane did not want to do so. World number one, World Cup quadriceps, World Cup triples, World Cup 250. The first win of the season, from the 7th to the 1st of the Grand Prix de France, 250 in Villard. As the last one, Stefan had won the 1st of the Grand Prix de France. In Brault, he is the real winner of the last one. The winner is coming. The winner is a few meters for Stefan. The first one has a little handstand. A little wheeling. A double for the official Honda. Since Bollet and second. He must be very happy to be second place here in Villard. And we are very happy for him. Indeed. Third place. I imagine that Sebastien is a little disappointed, although he made two mistakes, two slips that cost him a lot of time and certainly at least second place. Stefan who makes a turn of honor with the flag in Belgium as can be done by the pilots in Formula 1. As the pilots do at high speed because in Formula 1 they have no right to do so. The foca is a great speed, it's a very common practice. Sebastien Tortelli 3rd, we are waiting for Bayreur 5th behind Maschio, certainly 2nd Maria 6th and the incredible Paget 7th. Here I am, Stéphane Evers. Paget 7th, Carlsson 8th, Betis 9th, Berwoutz, Berwoutz who again after a good Dutch grand prix, in a slightly more anonymous place and there is no other French in the points. The Belgian is very comfortable last week, 12th only in front of Paul Cooper. The young Englishman is a goalkeeper, he's placed. Kaye is only 20th but it's not bad, Kaye is there. He was there 20th when we saw that Guidetti, like Talon Volland, was against the abandoned. And the Dutch also has a lot of Geisberg, who is less comfortable. Much less uncomfortable, it's for sure. And towards Stresza, Ploydi. The French are not only Chauvin, there are many Belgian around the track. This way, we can be so admirable in front of the talent of Stéphane. Indeed, a great champion. He seemed very confident after the tests. He was not at all worried for two seconds or almost that he had inflicted Sebastien Torcalio of his qualifiers. He was very confident for the Concebastien who still does a tour with the French flag. Sebastien who, let's remember him, only loses five points during this match compared to Stéphane. He had ten of them late. I did a great start, I was in the outside position on the grid I passed Sébastien in a pretty aggressive way in the first round and then I tried to dig the holes I won with about 20 seconds ahead, it's a pretty easy victory. And yes, a easy victory for Stéphane Evers, who obviously comforts his position as the leader in the World Champion after this first match of the Grand Prix of France to Villard. But we will meet again right away for the second match, a second match that we hope is at least as favorable to the French and perhaps a little less favorable. We say that absolutely with all due respect, we owe Stéphane Evers a little less favorable for the world champion. We meet again right away."

Les bandes de Bollinger sont plus ou moins parallèles, ne pas de signe d'accélération dans un sens ou dans un autre. Le RSI est là, dans le G sur le RSI, vous voyez que la ligne obliques de support a été franchie à la baisse, qu'on s'en fasse vers la zone des 40 qui donnera une accélération BCR. Et donc ça ici, c'est notre deuxième indicateur qui nous donne un mauvais signal sur le fait que l'on ait un bon signal. Vous l'aviez déjà vu si vous avez regardé le graphique du briefing de mon redis matin. On va probablement tester dès lundi avec que si cette zone est enfoncée, on fera faire attention à un retour faule 1,2870. Si je crois un peu d'urcus sur 6 mois, on va voir si on a d'autres zones de support intermédiaire. Je sais que vous avez grandi à la graphique pour avoir un peu plus de clarté visuelle. Donc on voit que cette zone ici qui a nombreuses fois été testée et réussi, On a encore une zone de support qui se trouve à 1,39°. Une zone de support important. Donc ça a vraiment été une zone de support important. L'aura des dernières séances ici. Si cette zone est enfoncée, on a une accélération baissée à marquer qui va se mettre en place sur l'aura de la. C'était mon avis sur l'aura de la. Vous pouvez nous rejoindre sur le site pour voir des avis sur un vis matière première.

The band of Bollinger are not parallel, no sign of acceleration in one direction or another. The RSI is very important, the RSI is there, danger on the RSI, you see that the support line has been crossed at low, we go to the 40 zone which will give a low acceleration, and so here is our second indicator which gives us a bad signal on the RSI, You have already seen the briefing of the day after tomorrow. We will probably test it on Monday, with this area being closed, we will have to be careful with a return to the first 2870. If I find it a bit hard to source, we will see if we have other zones of intermediate support. I try to enlarge the graphics to have more visual clarity. We see that this area here has been tested and succeeded many times. We have a support zone of 1.39 and under 1.39 we have a lot of things to do, maybe here at 1.29.62, a small resistance zone with micro support at 1.29.76 The last section of the video is a very important area. If this area is in French, we have a marked BSEI acceleration that will be replaced with the EUR. This was my opinion on the EUR. You can join us on the site to review the opinion on a 10 material first. There is still some space on our NAMUR conference. Thanks everyone and see you soon."

Capita così che a 7 giornate dal termine il Milan si trovi a interpretare la parte dell'unico antagonista della Lazio Capolista. E soprattutto succede che in sole e due domeniche i capitolini bruciano il vantaggio acquisito. La rimonta rossonera è epica. 7 vittorie consecutive portano a un clima. amoroso sorpasso e al raggiungimento del tricolore al foto finish nell'ultima domenica. Uno sprint mozzafiato per il campionato più emozionante del decennio. Per Paolo Maldini, Abbiati, Biroff, Wea e tutti gli straordinari artefici dell'impresa, lo scodetto numero 16 è il più inaspettato. Perciò è il più bello. La zione degli fedesi si sviluppa sulla sinistra e Burini, l'estissimo, scuscia e insacca. Con loro il Milan nel 1950-51 interrompi una stinenza d'altricolore durata a 44 anni. La squadra è fortissima in ogni reparto ma è soprattutto l'attacco a suscitare meraviglia. 107 e i gol segnati in una stagione caratterizzata da un testa a testa con l'inter battuta per un solo punto. I rosso neri si ripetono nel 1954-55. Partito Green la squadra viene rafforzata dal presidente Andrea Rizzoli con l'acquisto di un fuoriclasse proveniente da l'Uruguay. Juan Alberto Schiaffino, per lui gli aggettivi mirabolanti si sprecano e il suo modo di danzare sul campo le giustifica tutti. Lo scudetto è imprecisito dalle mesi ma imprese di Nordam, capo cannogliere per la quinta volta in sei anni. le pure i protagonisti hanno saputo precisarlo. Milano 1 Lazio","The most exciting of the Milanese century was the 1998-99, where it was a transition year with a goal defined and limited, the conquest of a place among the first four to get back into Europe that counts. With this proposal, Alberto Zacheroni is presented. Despite the two difficult seasons, the Udinese technical ex-technical claims that the team did not need radical discontent. The first responses are comfortable. The football is a world of surprises. It happens so that at seven days from the end Milan finds himself to play the part of the only antagonist of Lazio Capolista. And above all, it happens that in just two weeks the headlines burn the advantage acquired. The return to Rossonera is epic. Seven consecutive wins lead to a close draw. a lovey-dovey and the arrival of the tricolor at the end of the last Sunday. A mozzafiato sprint for the most exciting championship of the decade. For Paolo Maldini, Abbiati, Birow, Fuea and all the extraordinary artists of the company, the number 16 squad is the most unexpected, so it's the most beautiful. 50 to make Milan a great Italian football After the three skudettes of the origins 1901 1906 and 1907 the golden years the devil came back to triumph thanks to a trio of champions from Sweden The time of the Grenoli was born A name that is synthesized in a sigla, an incredible contribution of Gren, Nordal and Lidlholm Not even as a professor, a fireman and a Baron Milan in 1950-51 broke a stint in the league of the Colors during the 44 years. The team is very strong in every department but it is above all the attack to succeed. 107 goals scored in a season characterized by a header to header with Linter, beaten for a single point. The Reds and the Blacks repeat themselves in 1954-55. In the match, the team is strengthened by the president Andrea Rizzoli with the purchase of a top-class from Uruguay. Juan Alberto Schiaffino. For him, the wonderful adjectives are broken and his way of dancing on the field is justified by everyone. The skidding is precise by the month of the Northern's arrest, Capo Canoniere for the fifth time in six years. and the protagonists knew how to make it precise. At a psychologically dangerous moment, Milan goes to the Olympic to face Lazio, who could be the decisive part of the whole league. The Black and Reds have replaced Silvestri, Maldini and Nordal with Veraldo, Petroni and Vicariotto, and represent Sorensen on the right. At the Fischio del Arbitro Ianni, the Milanists have decided to play and after only four minutes they can make a goal. Reignani has a good ball on his feet and Saetta is on the edge of a few steps.

Сейчас вообще тяжело мне кажется всем. И тем, кто работает в силипопроке, и тем, кто работает просто в поп-направлении. Зовём это так, в поп-направлении. Потому что рынок стал жёстче, у всех выросли зубы, за всё нужно платить. Всё, грубо говоря, подорожало и услуги режиссёров. И не буду уже береть про телеканалы. В любом случае, она будет жить. не только в Украине, он везде во всех странах есть специализированные радиостанции, куда, например, поп-осполнители не пустят никогда, не возьмут ни за какие деньги, потому что это рок-станция. Есть наоборот такой формат, куда тяжелая музыка совершенно непременима, да это и не нужно. Этот формат размыт, потому что у нас супер-мегатяжелой музыки нет. И все группы, которые называют себя рок-группами, это все-таки поп-рок-группа. Добаваемая, которую можно поставить на любой по большому счету радиостанции с форматом в уклон там по музыке. Но все придумывают какой-то формат. Я не знаю, где он, что это за формат такой у нас в Украине. Видимо это как-то, как, не знаю, отговорки. Когда не хотят чего-то, сразу говорят формат. У меня уже такое просто восприятие этого слова. Сделать что-то такое необычное во-первых, во-вторых, у нас половина парней, с которыми я работаю, это настоящие поклонники группы «КИС». Мы так, когда обговаривали тему, как это может быть и что это может быть, плюс такая песня «Звезда чёт». То есть оно как бы всё само пришло, всё в руки пришло само собой. И вот эти вот маски, и это звезда на лице. Но как-то наша публика не оценила этот клип по достоинству, очень многим он не нравится, и очень многим не понравится. и надо воспринимать критику, но воспринимать ее адекватно. То есть, да, спасибо, я учту, либо не учту, либо мне ваше мнение, вообще не интересно, потому что сколько людей столько мнений? Это все равно, что мнение о внешности, в частности моей. Одни поделились на тех, кто считает, что мне лучше блондинкой быть, вторые поделились на тех, кто считает, что лучше оставаться бюрнеткой. Ну, нужно всегда иметь свое собственное мнение, несмотря на то, что мнение со стороны может быть тоже не глупым, правильным, каким-то, но отталкиваться всегда только от своего мнения всем понравится невозможно. Как сказал Поплавский, я не доллар, чтобы нравится всем. И я абсолютно спокойно воспринимаю тот факт, что не все меня любят и не всем нравится то, что я делаю. Главное, что мне есть своя аудитория и главное, что мне нравится его в первую очередь. Вы знаете, до последнего времени не было настойчивых поклонников, ну, были такие полу настойчивые, назовем их так. Но всё заканчивалось просто автографом. Ничего особенного. Но вот последнее время какой-то появился человек, который пишет мне сообщение на мобильный телефон. Вот с такой просьбой переписываться с ним. Ну, то есть это мне совсем не нравится. И я не понимаю, почему люди себя так ведут и на что человек рассчитывает, когда пишет подобное сообщение. Люблю очень своих фенов и люблю их еще из-за того, что они очень деликатно ведут себя. Когда они позволяют себе ничего лишнее. То есть они интересуются, конечно, моей личной жизни, интересуются творчеством. Они присылают мне много подарков, но чтобы это было какое-то требование от меня, там немедленно ты там должна мне что-то или еще что-то такого нет. Слава Богу. То есть подъезд не расписывали? Было такое время, когда и под балконом Соседи Домой на самом деле. И я не прекращаю удивляться всему. И той же природе, которую я видела тысячу раз, как и все мы, но я каждый раз ее люблю, как будто первый раз, когда выезжают на природ. Я впечатляюсь вообще людьми. Люди это вообще самое интересное, что может быть. Когда ты встречаешь интересного человека, вот это самое сильное впечатление. Меня впечатляет музыка по-прежнему, книги, кино. Ну, я очень не сухой человек. Вы, как бы, самое безумное у нее? Я не стыдно за те 10 лет, которые я прошла. Я не жалею ни о... В принципе, ни об одном дне. Я не сделала ничего такого, что могло бы... Ну, что... Что, в общем-то, могло бы испортить мою какую-то репутацию. Я имею в виду внутреннюю репутацию. Это дело такое, знаете. Мало ли, что вас там подумают. Иногда мне всё равно, что обо мне думают. Я верю в то, что всё будет хорошо. Если мы все будем хорошо стараться. Я верю в то, что трудолюбие можно добиться очень серьезных результатов. Всем зрителям телеканала Алекс я желаю побольше в жизни слушать хорошие музыки, смотреть хорошего кино и читать хороших книг. Это очень развивает и делает нашу жизнь более яркой и более интересной. Побольше хороших друзей в вашей жизни смотрите телеканал Алекс всегда ваша Алена Винницкая. Получилось вроде, да?","Hello, I'm Alina Vinitskaya, especially for the program Lesnitsa, Alex. It's hard to survive now, but I think that the good musical material wins. If it is, it doesn't matter in some style. If the song is liked by the listener, it will live. In any case, it will be listened to by the radio station. If the material is medium, then of course you can pay a lot of money for it, but it will live for a long time. And not only in Ukraine, but everywhere in the country, there is a specialized radio station, where pop performers never let them take any money, because it's rock-station. On the contrary, there is such a format where heavy music is completely useless, and it's not needed. This format is blurred, because we don't have super mega heavy music, and all the bands that call themselves rock-groups are still pop-rock bands. I think that it's possible to add a radio station format to any radio station. But everyone thinks of a format. I don't know what kind of format it is in Ukraine. It's like a conversation. When they don't want something, they immediately say a format. I already have such a perception of this word. We have to do something unusual. Secondly, we have half of the guys I work with. They are real fans of the KISS group. We talked about how it can be and what it can be. Plus, there is a song called Star of the Covenant. It came with everything in its own hands. And these masks and this star on the face. But somehow our audience did not appreciate this clip of dignity. Many people do not like it. They thought it was too simple, because of lack of information, that it was only stylization, that it was just a joke. It's just cool. It's not acceptable to any other way. Many people accepted it very negatively. You need to accept criticism, but you should accept it adequately. Yes, thank you, I will consider it, or I will not consider it, or I will consider your opinion at all. It is not interesting at all, because how many people have so many opinions. It is still the opinion of the outside world, in my own way. Some have split on those who think that I am better than Blondina, others have split on those who think that it is better to stay a brunette. Well, you always need to have your own opinion. Despite the fact that Maybe the opinion from the side is not stupid, right, but to push back from your opinion is impossible. As Poplava said, I'm not a dollar to like everyone. And I take it very calmly that not everyone loves me and not everyone likes what I do. The main thing is that I have my audience and the main thing is that I like them first of all. You know, there were no persistent fans until recently, but there were so-called semi-stressful ones. But everything ended with a photographer, nothing special. But recently, a person appeared who writes me a message on my mobile phone with such a request to re-write with him. I don't like it at all. I don't understand why people behave like this. And what does a person expect? They expect when they write such messages. I love my fans and I love them because they are very delicate. When they allow themselves nothing else. They are interested in my personal life, in my creativity. They send me a lot of gifts, but I need to have some kind of demand from me. Immediately I have to do something or something else. We came home just for the autographs. It was normal. I still have a school nearby. So they apparently saw the school and immediately the kids went home to me. Moreover, I had a marker on the first floor on the third floor. I was on the third floor. There was a drawn arrow on the wall. But we put the door, the code lock. Everything is fine. The neighbors were happy. Yes, it was not only us who needed it. I am a very impressive person. I don't stop being surprised by everything. I love nature like everyone else. I feel like I'm going to the nature for the first time. I feel like people. People are the most interesting thing. When you meet an interesting person, it's the strongest impression. I feel like music, books, movies. I'm not a very dry person. What is your most amazing opinion? I'm not ashamed of the 10 years I've been through. I don't regret it at all. I wouldn't do anything that would ruin my reputation. I mean my inner reputation. It's not enough to think about you, but sometimes I still think about myself. I believe that everything will be fine. If we all will try well, I believe that hard work can be achieved with very serious results. I wish all the viewers of the Alex TV channel more in life to listen to good music, watch good movies and read good books. This is very developed and makes our life brighter and more interesting. More good friends in your life watch the Alex TV channel, always your Alena Vinitskaya. It turned out, right?"

Ao largo desta película e seguendo o ensayo da quinta sinfonía de Schubert, les invitamos a ir desgranando dichos paralelismos e semejanzas en aspectos tan diversos como o liderazgo, os valores, o proceso de trabajo, a diferencia de roles e responsabilidades, ou a importancia e o diálogo. O espíritu de sacrificio e o de trabalho son factores fundamentales para a llegar a toda realización musical idónia. Por un lado, cada unha tendrá a ceder en sus tendencias excesivamente individualistas para ponerse ao serviço do todo. E por o outro, o trabalho está compuesto tanto por a acción de conjunto como por a preparación individual previa que cada músico Debe haber realizado antes de que tenga lugar o primer ensaio. Toda acción humana se manifiesta en unir e venir de tensión e distensión. que é o estadio xigente e todavía má sutil de ir logrando a unidade anelada. Quanto má se vá profundizando en a vivencia de la unidade, má se vá desarrollando un profundo sentimiento de interrelación con os demás. Ésto nos leva a descubrir que a igualdad nada tiene que ver con a uniformidade, ya que en a igualdad cada uno cumple unha función individual única. Quanto máis se dan cuenta de ello os integrantes del grupo, máis lejos queda a la tentación de establecer comparaciones e de que por consiguiente se produzcan rivalidades indeseadas. Un buen director es, por lo tanto, aquel que tiene a capacidad de captar a diversidad de individualidades de su orquesta e mostrando a cada músico su función específica unirlas todas en una vivencia común. o director se gana a autoridade ao hacer ver e a hacer sentir aos músicos que ele non é ni máis ni menos importante que cada uno de eles.","The musical process has clear parallels with the vital and work processes carried out in a company or institution. Throughout this film, following the essay of Schubert's Fifth Symphony, we invite you to go ungrasping these parallels and similarities in aspects as diverse as the leadership, values, the process of work, the difference in roles and responsibilities, or the importance of communication and dialogue. The spirit of sacrifice and work are fundamental factors to reach all musical and idonic realization. On the one hand, each one will have to be in excessively individualistic tendencies to get to the service of the whole. And on the other, the work is composed both by joint action and by the individual preparation prior to each musician must have done before the first rehearsal takes place. All human action manifests itself in uniting and coming from tension and distension. When one is not aware of this phenomenon, action loses its orientation, creating the feeling that something is being done, but at the same time, nowhere is reached. At this point in the rehearsal, we are in the phase of directing of the action, which is the next stage and even more useful to achieve the annihilated unity. The more you go deeper into the unity's life, the more you develop a deep sense of interrelation with others. This leads us to discover that equality has nothing to do with uniformity, since in equality each one fulfills a unique individual function. The further the members of the group realize it, the further the attempt to establish comparisons and that, consequently, they produce undesired rivalries. A good director is, therefore, the one who has the ability to capture the diversity of individualities of his orchestra and, showing to each musician their specific function, uniting them all in a common life. the director wins the authority to make it see and make it feel to the musicians that he is no longer or less important than each one of them."

Die vier Views, das sind vier grundlegende Prinzipien, wie man komplexe Daten präsentieren kann. Vorher braucht man allerdings erst mal ein Datenmodell und dann nehme ich gerne typisiertes Dataset, weil im Dataset Designer kann man ein Datenmodell konzipieren und das Programm schreibt dann eigentlich der Dataset Designer im Hintergrund für einen. Gut, dann holen wir mal so ein typisiertes Das ist der Dataset Designer und der ist leer. Also, was ich modellieren will, ist eine Art Kaufhaus. Da gibt es Artikel und jede Artikel gehört einer Kategorie an. Und jede Artikel wird von einem Lieferanten geliefert. Die Beziehungen sind jetzt so. Das eine Kategorie viele Artikel hat und ein Lieferant liefert aber auch viele Artikel. Also Artikel ist bei dem Untergeordnet. Ein Artikel ist der Kategorie untergeordnet und ein Artikel ist der den Lieferanten untergeordnet. Gut fangen wir an mit der Kategorie Tabelle. Kontextmenü hinzufügen, Datatable. Da klickst man dann in den Fensterbalken und sagt, Das ist eine Kategorie. Dann kann man noch mal Kontext mit so hinzufügen und Spalte machen. Da gibt es in Primär Schlüssel dieser Tabelle. Da heißt man mir MID. Es gibt auch noch eine schneller Art, Spalten zuzufügen, nämlich mit Steuerung und L. Nein. Das reicht erstmal. Hier unten machen wir dann die Lieferanten hin. Die Lieferanten kriegen auch eine Adresse. Die Artikel kommen. Das ist falsch. Die Artikel kommen zu den Datentypen. Ein Preis ist natürlich eine Zahl. Und Währungen modelliert man immer als Dezimal. Die Primärschlüssel müssen auf Auto-Inkrement gesetzt sein. Die Beziehung wird immer so gemacht, dass in der untergeordneten Tabelle ein Foreign Key Spalte angelegt wird. die auf die Oberübergeordnete Tabelle verweist. Also hier lege ich jetzt eine Category ID an und dann auch gleich die Deliver ID. Und die sind jetzt beide String und das ist falsch. Denn eine String foreign key Spalte kann nicht auf eine Integer Primärspalte verweisen. Also da müssen wir den Datentyp auch auf Int32 umstellen. So, jetzt kann ich aber die Relation gestalten. Also ich ziehe hier den Primärschüssel raus. und lasse ihn hier auf den Fremdschlüssel fallen. Wie ich diesen Dialog und wichtig ist, dass man auch Beziehungs- und Fremdschlüsseleinschränkung aktiviert. Und weiterhin wichtig ist, dass die Aktualisierungsregel und das Delush-Regel auf Cascade eingestellt sind. Dasselbe mache ich jetzt hier mit dem Deliverer und fertig. Zur Vollständigkeit kann man noch die Relationsbezeichnungen anzeigen und dann ist das Datenmodell fertig. Wo wir es nützt, ist das auf dem Form. Hier ist das Form. Dazu holt man sich das Datenfenster. Hier ist das Datenfenster. Da sind unsere drei Tabellen drin. Ich will nun mal die Artikel anzeigen. Ziehe ich einfach aufs Form und kriege ein Data GridView hingeneriert. Jetzt schließe ich erst einmal und schließe es mit DogFill. Dann muss dieser Binding Navigator weg. Das ist das dümmste Kontroll, das ihr erfunden wollt. Das wäre irgendwie im Großen und Ganzen die Ansicht. Jetzt haben wir im Hintergrund noch etwas gekodet, dass erst mal Daten generiert werden. Wenn man genau hinschaut, kann man erkennen, hier werden 7 von 0 bis 6 Kategorien hinzugefügt. Und hier werden 7 von 0 bis 6 Lieferanten zugefügt. Jetzt gibt es zwei Schleifen, die Artikel zufügen. Der erste Schleife, zwei verschachtelte Schleife. Die ersten verschachtelten Schleife gehen in die Kategorien von 0 bis 3, das sind vier Kategorien. Die Lieferanten gehen von 2 bis 6, das sind fünf Lieferanten. Für vier Kategorien und fünf Lieferanten wird ein Artikel generiert. Umgedreht. Also jetzt gehen die Kategorien von zwei bis sechs. Das sind fünf Kategorien jetzt und die Lieferanten von null bis drei. Das sind vier Lieferanten. Und nochmal generiert jede dieser Permutationen ein Artikel. Das ergibt dann eine Überschneidung im mittleren Bereich. Also die Kategorien null und zwei werden nur von einem Lieferanten beliefert. Während im mittleren Bereich von zwei bis 3. gibt es mehrere Lieferanten in der selten Kategorie. und da sieht man nichts wie der Lieferant oder die Kategorie heißt. Aber die Artikel sind richtig drin. Da sind die Preise und die Bezeichnungen. Am Artikel habe ich auch so gemacht, dass man die erste Zahl ist die Artikelnummer, die zweite Zahl ist die Kategoriennummer und die dritte Zahl ist der Lieferant. So, mehr wollte ich aber in diesem Tut gar nicht machen. Im nächsten geht es weiter mit dem RawView. Das ist hier, ist er noch schlimmer als der RawView.","Welcome to my little film series, data modeling and the four views. The four views are four basic principles how to present complex data. First you need a data model and then I like to take a typized dataset. In the dataset designer you can design a data model and the program then writes the dataset designer in the background for one. The data set is provided by a form and a menu. The data set is called the data set designer and the data set is empty. What I want to model is a kind of shopping mall. There is an article and each article belongs to a category. Each article is delivered by a supplier. The one category has many articles and a supplier also provides many articles. So the article is both underordained. An article is the category underordained and an article is the supplier underordained. Well, let's start with the category table. Add the context menu to the data table. Then you click on the window bars and say that Now we can add a new context. There are a few keys to this table. There is also a faster way to add a split. The articles are coming. Oh, that's wrong. Now we make a ID and a name. Oh, they get a price. Now we come to the data types. A price is set in standard terms, but a price is of course a number and values are always modeled as a decimal. Other problems are the primary keys. They have to be set on auto-increment. To set the data, the data is transferred to the end32. Also, you have to make sure that the primary key is connected. And now we design the relationship between category, article and deliverer. A relationship is always done in the underordained table, a foreign key is assigned to the share. Now I put a category ID and the deliver ID. and let it fall on the foreign key. The dialogue is important that you activate the relationship and foreign key restrictions. And the important thing is that the update rule and the solution rule are set to cascade. I do the same with the Deliverer and done. To complete, you can also show the relation numbers and then the data model is finished. Something that is useful on the form, here is the form. We need to put the data window in the box. Here are our three tables. I just want to show the articles. I just pull on the form and generate a data grid view. First we need to unlock with docfill. Then we need to remove the binding navigator. This is the deepest control that we want to find. This is the view. Now I have coded something in the background. First generate data. This is the generate function. If you look closely, you can see that here are 7 of 0 to 6 categories. And here are 7 of 0 to 6 suppliers. Now we have two types of stripes. The first stripe is two striped stripes. The first stripe is the category of 0-3. The suppliers are 2-6. The suppliers are 5. For 4 categories and 5 suppliers, a stripe is generated. Now we have the categories of 2-6. These are 5 categories and the suppliers of 0-3. There are 4 suppliers. And again, each of these permutations generates an article. This gives a cutout in the middle area. The categories 0 and 2 are delivered only from one supplier. 3. There are several suppliers in the same category. In this middle area there will be a much larger value supply. I can start this. I press F5. The wine doesn't. Here is the form. I pull it big. Now I press Generate. I see all articles. It looks like shit. and there you can see nothing like the supplier or the category is called, but the articles are really in there. There are the prices and the drawings. But I did the article in such a way that the first number is the article number, the second number is the category number and the third number is the supplier.

This is Danny back with another case review and I'm gonna be looking at the worth rink a Nexus 4 slim case and this is the revised version the second version they put out because there was an issue with the first one and This retails for 999 each available on the Amazon and their website so make sure you check them out and It comes in an eco-friendly package just like it did before and here's a little note saying thank you and if you're not satisfied Make sure you hit them up and it's very true because I hit them up on their first cases. They sent me two right away that were revised. No charges. They have great customer service. So I definitely appreciate that. Thank you for sending them out so quickly. And it was very good that they listened to their customers, which I really like. And there is the old version right there. And it's pretty hard to see on camera, but the left side is the problem that they were having problems with by the volume rocker. And if you look closely, you can see that is four to five. on the left upper corner. So let's go ahead and put in the Nexus 4 and if I can put it in the right way. So let's go ahead and click it in there and you can see that on the top left there, see how it is larger than the right side? You can see that it's lipped over on the left side. And you can see now that it is very strong by the volume rocker. There's no movement at all. The first one was very, very easy too and it was really really annoying that when you touch the volume rocker or held the phone, you can feel it moving on that side. And this does come with a matte finish, which is nice. The white and black versions are both matte, so that's very good. And it's a very solid feeling case. And definitely one of my favorite cases. The only problem is that this is pretty tight now, so it's a little bit hard to take off, but make sure you do it from the corners. And let me just demonstrate for you the old one. And you can watch my old video on that too as well. But you can see that it doesn't and side at all. Very solid feeling case and with that fortified lip over there on the left side. It does look a little funny I guess because it's not equal to the right side on the top but you really won't notice it that much. I like it. It's got a really good matte finish to it and it's got pretty good grip on it as well and I really like this case. It doesn't interfere with NFC or wireless charging so that's really really good as well and I have no problems with this case now and recommending this case for $10. picture of the white case and it's just the same matte finish and you can see a little bit of the white from the front.

I love that ad. All right. Now you see this? Come on in here. Therian Therian said, you can't, when Randy Carlisle saw this, we want you. What they're saying is, the reporters say it, but they say, oh yeah, I can see Therian saying now, eh? Hey, wait a minute, somebody must be, yeah, oh absolutely. We all want that right now. Let's see, let's the minute, let me tell you something. They want you, we want you, I guarantee you, I can prove it. It happened to me in Boston my first year. Chicago 6-1 Tony Esposito was in the net headlines Tony finish the whole deal I saw it almost fainted next game you couldn't get a pee by him I think we would shot him 52-18 don't you worry they'll be because they'll say hey somebody must have said something you are the boss and Tim Lai wiki by the way is strangely enough when LA won last year he's up here in the section of the Sun the new CEO president of the Toronto Maple Leafs visited the whole Stanley Cup final with you so yeah I don't touch this suit. Oh this here the last time I wore this suit while anything when I coached the boss of Bruins my last time coached the boss of Bruins was in this beautiful suit. Well speaking of line changes. Line changes. What Toronto has to watch. They're a little slack on this playoffs. I know you got to watch those changes. Watch the defense here almost cost a goal. You got to sharpen up something like this. You cannot have something like that happen in the playoffs. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm the one guy that knows. Who's fault? Loopholes or the D's? Well, they're all you gotta dump the puck in you. You make that red line. They count on you making that red line. Go sideways and make it do anything but get it in. Don't get caught. Now, Jared Tenority, we gotta talk about this guy. Watch this little hit while I'll talk. Son of Mark, last week he had eight hits. Canadians had 15 called up from Hamilton. This guy caused the goal. Nice hit and everything like that. Hit Kerboski. Like I said, a pig that went around 15, had say he had eight. They found they got a beauty in that guy. 6'6"", 215 pounds. Hey, Stanley Cup playoff start Tuesday. Well, I want to say something first of all. Okay, I want to say something first of all. My good buddy and a good friend of my, Duncan Keith, is in a little trouble in Vancouver. And the reason was that he was smarty to a female reporter and it was they just said something about you should be a referee or something and the males, she didn't say anything but the male reporters went a little nuts and everything like that. Now he's a sexist and all that stuff. I don't believe, and I really believe this, I don't believe women should be in the male dressing room. I, I know, wait a minute, I remember the first time it happened to me. Guys are walking around naked and I hear this woman's voice. I turn around, there's a woman. She's asking me about the power play. I said, let's go outside. And I just, she said, I'm not embarrassed. I said, I am. Well, I totally think a woman can be in the dressing room. I do believe a lot of guys take advantage and they are sexist Duncan Keith wasn't even close He's always hot about the fact she was making a call and he was like wait a minute women should be like in any job equal opportunity then why aren't men in women dressing room well, they should be We'll fix that you want them to be in there. Why not? Well listen Carrie plays hockey, right? Yes, and she's a hockey player Yes, and she's in taking a shower, right and the guys Sports too I could talk about it and everything like that. I don't fail women are equal I feel they're above us and I think they're on a pedestal and they should not be walking in when naked guys are walking in and you know some guys take advantage of it I don't think it should be that's the way I feel about the whole thing now the playoffs Don't tell me this is an exciting the last two weeks Unbelievable. I remember back when the Montreal Canadians they lost one game all year at home I mean eight games all year. It was a gimme teams were out the Christmas they're over with this is a hockey is fun now take for instance clumps if they get in I mean if they get in there's nothing nothing that braboski we got something there I would hate to play this guy this guy I know we're taking Columbus what are we talking about Columbus for but look at this guy watch this here guys should be the MVP if they make the plebs he's unbelievable if he ever got against them Columbus that could be the LA of the thing now New York today. I wanted which, yeah, and Lundquist, he would got a shutout today, he'd finally come into life. Now, I want to wish Canada good luck against the under 18. This is very important. There's 200 scouts over there, by the way. Most counted even more in the prospect. The kid over there called McDavid, who I've watched since he's 14. I know nobody else was watching him. Watch this here kid. Let me tell you something. Got two hat tricks. The word out now, if he is 16, if they had a draft, if he could go in the draft, He'd be the number one guy right now played for the Marlies and Bennett and all those Marley guys this guy have watched since he's 14 and I'm telling you he is terrific. He honestly believe he'll be the next Crosby as far and I told you about him two years ago. I know nobody was in the room in the in the arena because nobody was there freezing. All right. Play hockey with him and very this. As you say he could be number one this year the number one last year was nail Yacob Havin this is just a little no little thing I want to tell look at this. here. I try to tell him at the start this is a nothing game going on. Now he's a good kid and everything but look it's a nothing game and look at what he does. Lucky grabs us. Watch you see him grab the sweater. It's a nothing game. Remember the first one I like the kid. I want you to show you what how classes in Canada what we do. Now watch tapes here. Now watch he scored goals before and he's going to score a lot of goals. And you know if you notice McDavid he didn't jump around either. Now watch came comes in. He's got to calm down watch Kane after a goal. I like the what they used to say Pellets, Missy, you know, I've scored him before and I'm going to score a lot more and that's where you have to act I didn't mean to pick on the kid but he's got to smarten up a little too quickies Vinnie Lecavelier and Marty St. Louis and Steven Stamco's had a chance for the empty netter the other night now watch kids wait a minute watch kids When you have an open I got to say this here Sometimes I've seen where guys try to pass it to a minute comes back and they score when you know it's okay to pass it pass it but what's the caveat would say Adam Oates had the theory that if you start looking for oh yeah that said if you start looking he said but it was a hot trick it was nothing they're out of the playoff and Adam Oates is right I don't know I'm I'm assuming what he said was hey dog if you can put it in put it in he said look you start looking for a pass Brett Brett Hall was the worst because he hated score a hat trick and empty net he said Brett you start trying to make a pass you could get hurt you're gonna let up a little bit you're gonna get caught you try to look the sideways of but Brent wouldn't anyway but I got in with this and I it's all important I've seen in the minor midges games you know trying to set up a guy they pass it over it goes in the end but anyhow that's the Canadian way and I thought it was pretty good Logan we got time just for oh Logan could chair all right listen this is a piece to recite thoughts here's a guy that leads off he's uh he's all forwards no second and boards uh Callaghan's first with New York he's a leader out there he blocked shots watch the block shots he scores a goal him and Joe this guy here, Brian Kilroy taught him well.

I just wanted to share with you guys what I've been working on. But before I do so, I want to say thank you so much to follow the paper trail on YouTube. You are very inspirational and if you are watching this video, you have inspired me in so many ways. Thank you so much for sharing with us all of your work and your techniques and I totally scrap lifted your technique on the paper bag mini. album. Hopefully you don't mind. I totally loved it and I had to do something. I had to try out that technique and I totally loved it. Thank you for doing this tutorial on that. Okay so this is my take on the Paper Bag Mini Album and hopefully you guys will like it. Let me tell you some of the things that I've used in here. So first up I use the Kisarasa paper by Can Company. I stole this flower from my mom. Shh, don't tell her. She has a big bouquet of like silk flowers and every time I go to visit her I snatch one. So hopefully she won't miss them. So I took this one from her. It's so pretty and it goes perfectly. I had to take it. And then these are from Michaels. I believe these are now 25 cents or 29 cents in Michaels. I didn't use my bind at all. I used twine to bind together. I also added some Tim Holtz Swivel Clasp a Tim Holtz Love Key and a charm from the jewelry section at Michaels and I rubbed some of the folk art aquamarine metallic paint down into the words so it's kind of that aqua color. It is honor family loyalty unity kindness humor trust charity passion joy. It just has a whole bunch of very sweet words on there The adhesive boarders for the line of paper are more ribbon on the side. The word family, I bought the chipboard orange during Halloween from Target for $0.99. I painted it with the folk art metallic paint and I heated it with my heat tool and it bubbled and it created that effect. very pretty, very very pretty. Love it. So that's outside the album and this is the inside. So hopefully I'm in frame and I am. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to flip through the album and then if I have time when I'm done I will go through some of the techniques which I will tell you what they are right now because I didn't do that many. I used a lot of Glimmer Mist. I used the Folk Art Paint. I used the Peridot embossing powder by Stampendis. And the Flourish Stamp is by Autumn Leaves, I believe. Okay, so let's go through. And I'm just gonna flip through. So that's the paper bag, that's the flap. This is the paper bag, that's the flap. Mommy's making a video, okay? Let's see who can be quiet. Paper bag, flap, paper bag, flap, paper bag, flap, paper bag, the end. So that's how it goes. Again, follow the paper trail for a tutorial on how to do this album. As long as you follow the paper trail, you'll be able to create an album like this as well. It was super simple. If you follow her technique and the results it's just tremendous. Love it. So I'll show you some of the tags. A lot of glimmer mist and a lot of embossing on these. This one doesn't really have much on it. These are photo mats. So we'll go ahead and just add maybe a matted photo to the phone ringing. Okay. I just got thrown off paper bag, tag, photo mat, more of those. I'm not going too fast. But now the phone's vibrating. Somebody really wants me. Somebody really needs me. I wonder who it is. I wonder who it is. Okay. So pretty. Someone did a tutorial on how to create your own journal stamps. So this was This is what it initially looked like. Just that. And then I added some little swirls to it. And I love it. It's so pretty. You can't find a stamp like this on your own. You'd have to create something that beautiful. This is functional. This is functional. This is functional. Love this. So pretty. Okay guys. So that's my mini. Hopefully you guys all like this. It was a lot of fun to do. I hope you guys enjoyed and thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe. I have another album coming up pretty soon. It took me a while to post this one. I'm working on it. I will have something for you guys again soon. Thank you guys for all your sweet words and sweet comments and thanks for subscribing. I can't believe I already have 200 subscribers to my channel. It's amazing. I need to do a giveaway. away soon. You need to start gathering stuff for that giveaway. I've been thinking about it and I will but you need to subscribe to my channel and you need to post a comment. Thanks for watching guys! Tune in!","Hello everybody and welcome to iScrip happy video. I just wanted to share with you guys what I've been working on but before I do so I want to say thank you so much to follow the paper trail on YouTube. You are very inspirational and if you are watching this video you have inspired me in so many ways. Thank you so much for sharing with us all of your work and your techniques and I totally scrap lifted your technique on the paper bag mini album. Hopefully you don't mind. I totally loved it and I had to do something. I had to try out that technique and I totally loved it. Thank you for doing this tutorial on that. Okay so this is my take on the Paper Bag Mini album and hopefully you guys will like it. Let me tell you some of the things that I've used in here. So first up I use the Kisarasa paper by Can Company. I stole this flower from my mom. Shh, don't tell her. She has a big bouquet of like silk flowers and every time I go to visit her, I snatch one. So hopefully she won't miss them. So I took this one from her. It's so pretty and it goes perfectly. I had to take it. And then these are from Michaels. I believe these are now 25 cents or 29 cents in Michaels. I didn't use my bind at all. I used twine to bind together. I also added some Tim Holtz Swivel Clasp a Tim Holtz Love Key and a charm from the jewelry section at Michaels and I rubbed some of the folk art aquamarine metallic paint down into the words so it's kind of that aqua color. It is honor family loyalty unity kindness humor trust charity passion joy. It just has a whole bunch of very sweet words on there The adhesive board is for the line of paper, so more ribbon on the side. I bought the chipboard in orange. I bought it during Halloween from Target for $0.99. I painted it with the Folk Art Metallic Paint and I heated it with my heat tool and it bubbled and it created that effect. very pretty, very very pretty. Love it. So that's outside the album and this is the inside. So hopefully I'm in frame and I am. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to flip through the album and then if I have time when I'm done I will go through some of the techniques which I will tell you what they are right now because I didn't do that many. I used a lot of Glimmer Mist. I used the Folk Art Paint. I used the Peridot embossing powder by Stampendis. And the Flourish Stamp is by Autumn Leaves, I believe. Okay, so let's go through. And I'm just gonna flip through. So that's the paper bag, that's the flap. This is the paper bag, that's the flap. Mommy's making a video, okay? Let's see who can be quiet. Paper bag, flap, paper bag, flap, paper bag, flap, paper bag, the end. So that's how it goes. Again, follow the paper trail for a tutorial on how to do this album. As long as you follow the paper trail, you'll be able to create an album like this as well. It was super simple. If you follow her technique and the results, it's just tremendous. Love it. So I'll show you some of the tags. A lot of glimmer mist and a lot of embossing on these. This one doesn't really have much on it. These are photo mats. So we'll go ahead and just add maybe a matted photo to the phone ringing. Okay. I just got thrown off paper bag, tag, photo mat, more of those. I'm not going too fast. Now the phone is vibrating.

This is just going to be the highest overclock I can achieve in Windows and I've got a new CPU cooler mounted Changed around my computer bits if you want to see that check out some other videos. I'll put some links in description So I want to start off here and buy it I'll show you guys some settings that I'm going to start out with and then I'll boot into Windows and then we'll go from there. Alright first off I just want to say I really enjoy working with the Gigabyte BIOS. It's a very nice layout. I like the settings. The values are nice as far as increasing voltages. So first off let's go to the motherboard intelligence tweaker and you can see here this is all of our stock settings and all the stock voltages. I'm going for basically a CPU only overclock. So what I want to do is take everything else out of the equation. So we're going to lower our memory. We'll go in here and we should be good with all this. So what we're going to do is give ourselves an increase on the CPU voltage to start out. Set it to normal. So give it pretty high voltage. We're going to need to increase it in Windows anyway. So we're going to set the CPU ratio to and it's my setup basically in the half 912 stock cooler so now what I'm gonna do we're gonna check everything out check our temperatures and open up some programs we'll start overclocking this thing see how high we can go just a quick look at the tech station for all you guys who haven't seen it that's our cooling got a fan here over our VRNs Northbridge and the fan there is pretty close to the memory so it's sucking some heat off there but like I said this is pretty much a CPU only overclock. Okay so I'm in Windows now and I'm going to be using AMD Overdrive for my software overclocking. See here we also have CPU Z this is version 1.58 which is as far as I know as of making this video is the latest version. I also have Core Temp 1.0 at the bottom there I know I'm not really talking about temperatures but I just want to check just want to keep a monitor on them while I'm doing this and I'm sure they're not going to go up very high just because I'm not loading the CPU up. For example, it says we're at 22 Celsius now, which is not... This is why I always stress to people that idle temperatures do not mean anything because my CPU is at 22 degrees Celsius with a max of 25 so far that I've been idling here. Yet my room temperature is currently 27 degrees Celsius, so there's no way that's right. So idle temperatures don't mean anything. Anyway, I'm moving on. So you can see here, We have our multiplier adjustments, hyper transport multiplier, reference clock, all that other stuff here, CPU voltage. Okay, let's start this out first off. I'm gonna increase my CPU voltage slightly. We're at 1.4 volts. It's up the multiplier, 19.5, 3.926. It's up the voltage slightly more. 4.127 gigahertz Z-tune 6 software. If I still can't get 4.2, then well, I'll be kind of upset, but I think it's possible. Let's try it out. So we're sitting at 1.488 volts right now. 4.026. So we're gonna increase the voltage one more. Should be 1.504. So let's try. Now this is our previous overclock of 4.127. So let's go to 20. 4.228 happy I got my 4.2 so alright guys well I met my expectations I wanted to hit 4.2 gigahertz I got 4.22 very good it's a nice start so now I can go back and do some hardware but uploads the other chat with you soon more videos to come","What's going on everyone it's Rick Arder here today's video I am going to attempt to get the highest overclock that I can on my phenome to x2555 black edition CPU Now this is not going to be for any type of stability This is just going to be the highest overclock I can achieve in Windows and I've got a new CPU cooler mounted Changed around my computer bits if you want to see that check out some other videos.

I'll show you guys just the start up here real quick. The computer isn't overly loud either. I'll show you guys that in a second just a quick look, setup.

Теперь до весны следующего года, а отдохнуть с белосиньем вряд ли удастся. Начался режим постоянных спортивных нагрузок. Опытные наставники для игроков разработали специальную схему подготовки. Силовые занятия сочетаются с тренировками новую носливость. Итак, два раза в день, по два часа. Кроме того, режим дня включает массаж катания на роликах, короткие прогунки по берегу Байкала. Сбоев в программе быть не должно, поэтому даже на вопросы журналистов хоккеисты отвечают не отрывайся отдел. Но пресезонка проходит без каких-то трудностей. Эту тренировку Белосинией проводят с новым капитаном. На кону не игроки методам закрытого голосования выбрали лидера команды. Им стал Андрей Ковалев, ползащитник с большим перевесом голосов, а передел защитника Максима Блема и нападающего Александра Насонова. Эти игроки в предстоящем сезоне станут помощниками капитана, а сам Ковалев уже вырабатывает стратегию успеха команды. Впрочем, истинную силу и успехи команды как всегда покажут результаты матча перед Белосинями в этом году, как и в предыдущих, стоят все те же задачи. Выигрывает в каждые встречи. Ближайшие игры пройдут в Кемерово 28 сентября, там начнется спорт битва за Кубок России. В Николе-Байкаланергии будет тренироваться до конца этой недели. Затем хоккеисты примут участие в традиционном теннисном турнире. Проедут по плану беда в следовании. Завершающим этапом подготовки перед новыми победами станут тренировки на Альду-Хакийного стадиона Ирмак.","They come in the form of a year, and it is unlikely that they will succeed to rest with the Belarusian. The mode of constant sports loads began. Experienced athletes for the players developed a special training scheme. The strength training is combined with the training of endurance. And so, two times a day, for two hours. In addition, the day mode includes a massage, a dance on the rollers, short walks along the coast of the Baykal. There should be no fights in the program, so even journalists and hockey players answer to the questions. But during the season, without any difficulties. This training, Belosinia, is held with a new captain. At the end of the game, the players chose the leader of the team, the method of closed voting. Andrey Kovalyev became the leader. The defender with a large weight of the votes has changed the defender Maxim Oblem and the attacking Aleksandr Nassonov. These players in the upcoming season will become the assistant captains. And Kovalev himself is already working out the strategy of the team's success. I paid attention to the training staff. It's the most important thing. And there will be success. In fact, the true strength and success of the team will always show the results of the match before the Belasin. This year, as in the previous, the same tasks are still in place. The next games will be held in the CEMER on September 28. The fight for the Russian Cup will begin. There will be one task, the final part of the Russian Cup will be held. We are going to the Russian Cup in three days, we are going to the World Cup, where we will participate in a very prestigious tournament. Nikolay Baikal-Energia will train until the end of this week. The hockey players will take part in the traditional tennis tournament. The events will be held in the following order. The final stage is preparing for the new victories. The training will be on the ice hockey stadium Irmak. Irina Goponchik, Ekaterina Lamin, Konstantin Sinitsa."

The results come in as follows. Turtle gets 9% of the vote, Monkey gets 18, Gorilla gets 19, Owl gets 13, Leopard gets 20, Tiger gets 15, and Snake gets 6. Under the rules of First Pass the post, Leopard is crowned the winner and she gets to rule for the length of her term. But take another look at the results and you'll see the first problem with this system, Minority Rule. The vast majority of citizens, 80%, wanted someone else's king but Leopard still won. There were only 7 candidates in this race but if you imagine if there had been 20, she might have only gotten 5% of the vote but still been elected. This problem of minority rule is only the beginning. The second problem with First Pass the Post is that, given enough time, it results in an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system. Why? To see, let's watch what happens over several election cycles. Leppart has had her term in office and it's again election time in the young democracy. Only now, all the citizens of Animal Kingdom remember the results from last time. This information changes how they'll behave, particularly Snake and Turtle Voters, who must face the reality that they've backed unappealing, extremist candidates who don't have a chance of winning. Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leprord Rule, decide to back the candidate who is the best chance of winning, Guerrilla. Now Snake voters want to vote for Tiger, who is the candidate they have the most in common with, but they're afraid to because Leprord is running a negative campaign against her competitors. Snake voters, not liking the idea of Guerrilla Rule, vote strategically for Leprord. The final result looks like this, with Leprord getting 26% of the vote and Guerrilla getting 28, making him the new king. Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results and knowing the cost of their campaigns, decide to drop out of future races. party system is now down to five. Fast forward to the next election. Only five candidates run, and again the voters remember what happened last time. In this election, it's owl voters who recognize that their candidate cannot win. They are centrist voters and less ideological than the rest of the animal kingdom. As such, they don't really like gorilla or leopard. Both gorilla and leopard know this, so they each run negative campaigns to capitalize on the fears of the centrists. Owl voters split their vote and are mostly voting against the candidate they dislike rather than supporting the candidate they do like. After this election, gorilla gets 33% of the vote and Leopard gets 34, making her the winner. Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops out of the race. In the last election we'll look at, Monkey and Tiger voters are unhappy. They both really liked the candidates they have supported, but they now have to compromise. Monkey voters agree with Gorilla on few issues, but they really don't like Leopard, and Tiger voters agree with Leopard on some issues, but they really don't like Gorilla. They strategically abandon their preferred candidate out of fear of the one they disagree with the most becoming king. The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla 51, with him being crown the king. Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to drop out, and now the animal kingdom is left with the two-party system. Because of the centrist and swayable owl voters, in future elections, Leopard might take the crown, then Gorilla wins it back, only to lose it to Leopard again, but the two parties never change. The citizens of Animal Kingdom ended up with the system, not because they are lazy voters or because that's what they really wanted, but because the mathematics of how the system is set up. Inevitably, given enough time, all first past the post systems trend towards two main parties. But the choices of the voters still has not changed since that first election. Only two-fifths of them wanted either Leopard or Gorilla as their first choice, and three-fifths of them wanted someone else as their first choice. It's this majority of the voters that becomes disinterested in the democratic process because they feel they have no meaningful way to express their real preferences. But it only gets worse from here. If the citizens of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups before they vote, they are susceptible to gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine a block of ten homes each with one voter inside. Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla voters, and four are Owl voters. up into groups before they vote, whoever decides where the lines are drawn has enormous influence over who wins the election. For example, if you group the three leopard voters with the two owl voters, and do the same with the three gorilla voters, you can eliminate owl from the election, even though owl voters have the largest minority and would win under a straight first pass-the-post vote. If the leopard or gorilla parties are in charge when the voting boundaries are drawn, they have enormous incentive to carve out safe seats for themselves. But more on gerrymandering in another video. Bah! I hear you say, vote third party and change the system. This brings us to the final and possibly worst problem of first-past-the-post, the spoiler effect. This is the first past the post system at its worst. The better a third party candidate does, the more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing a loss for the party they most agree with and a win for the party they most disagree with. And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool. He knows how the system works. Where do you think some of those gold donations came from? Meanwhile, the Queen Linus is displeased. She's been observing the elections and sees that the system is bad for her subjects. And she's been thinking, what makes a good voting system? Well, you should be able to vote for the candidate who's the most it who you like the most without worrying. More choice in representatives is better, the system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering, and it should be open to new political parties. Luckily for the Queen, there are several different voting systems to choose from, including the alternative vote, but that will have to be discussed in detail at another time.

All citizens get one and only one vote and that the candidate with the most votes wins the crown. This method of voting is most often called first pass the post, awkwardly abbreviated as FPTP or winner take all. The system is simple, fair, and logical, right? Actually no, it's a terrible, terrible idea. Why? Well to see the problems with first pass the post, let's watch the first election unfold in the animal kingdom. It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy and seven hopeful candidates come forward to run and represent their parties. They put on their best campaigns, citizens head out to the polls and the votes are counted. The results come in as follows. Turtle gets 9% of the vote, Monkey gets 18, Gorilla gets 19, Owl gets 13, Leopard gets 20, Tiger gets 15, and Snake gets 6.

I'm the founder of the Indie Ghost Hunters. I am the one that you sent the email to to see if we had any kind of interesting adventures or any kind of activity or anything that might be good for your show, my ghost story. The main place that we have investigated here in Indianapolis is called the Hannah House. And we probably had most of a lot of experiences there and probably the main one that we had happened back in 2005 and that involved my ghost daughter Stacy. She came up into the attic at my request. The background story behind this is that there was a small child that had been misbehaving, taken upstairs to be punished, and because of the punishment, he died from his wounds. To hide the evidence, so I'm going to guess that this was probably a slave that they had taken upstairs to hide the evidence they burned the body in the attic. Now at first we weren't too sure about this, but they actually showed us burn marks on the roof and on the rafters in the area that this took place. Since then the house has been fixed and it is no longer there, which is too bad because that was actually one of the main parts that made that gave that story some kind of validation. But the night that we were there, I had a group of guys upstairs in the attic and we were trying to get some kind of response out of this boy. And nothing seemed to be working, so I thought it would be a great idea to bring up Stacey and maybe another female Some of us say it says maybe some of us say it says a little bit and shortly after that one of our investigators had a digital thermometer and she noticed that the temperature was actually starting to drop and She didn't mention anything to Stacy about it, but shortly after that happened It was like all of a sudden I noticed Stacy jump up Screaming running just you know some blood curdling scream that she let out come running towards us and of course I'm like no Hayden She said that something had taken it, it's like it took its fingers and just rubbed it from the top of her head all the way down. After that we've not really been able to get Stacy back in that house too often. It actually took about three days worth of high column chick flicks where we had to sit and watch them with her so that she could actually sleep at night time. The reason why she was having so much trouble sleeping was when she would go to sleep shortly after she was out. after this happened, she kept getting the image of this boy in her head and she wasn't able to sleep at all. Some of the other things that have happened in the house to us, we've actually caught a baby buggy moving by itself. We have been told to leave the house. We've been told to get out. We've investigated this house enough that one of our investigators has been called out by name. His name is Tim and while we were cleaning up after an investigation, one of the cameras was still running as he walked by. We heard a voice say Tim is there still things at the Hanah house? Yeah, I honestly think there is why I have no idea. I don't know why whatever is there has not moved on to possibly better things. Maybe that's the reason why they are still there is because they're not going on to better things. I really don't know. But that's that's basically our story. And we hope you like it and we thank you for your time. Thank you.","Hi, I'm Bob Newkirk. I'm the founder of the IndieGoes Tunners. I am the one that you sent the email to to see if we had any kind of interesting adventures or any kind of activity or anything that might be good for your show, my ghost story. The main place that we have investigated here in Indianapolis is called the Hannah House and we probably had most of a lot of experiences there and probably the main one that we had happen back in 2005 and that involved my ghost daughter Stacy. She came up into the attic at my request. The background story behind this is that there was a small child that had been misbehaving, taken upstairs to be punished. And because of the punishment, he died from his wounds. To hide the evidence, so I'm going to guess that this was probably a slave that they had taken upstairs to hide the evidence they burned the body in the attic. Now at first we weren't too sure about this, but they actually showed us burn marks on the roof and on the rafters in the area that this took place. Since then the house has been fixed and it is no longer there, which is too bad because that was actually one of the main parts that made that gave that story some kind of validation. But the night that we were there, I had a group of guys upstairs in the attic and we were trying to get some kind of response out of this boy. And nothing seemed to be working, so I thought it would be a great idea to bring up Stacey and maybe another female Some of us say it says maybe some of us say it says a little bit and shortly after that one of our investigators had a digital thermometer and she noticed that The temperature was actually starting to drop and she didn't mention anything to Stacy about it But shortly after that happened it was like all of a sudden I noticed Stacy jump up Screaming running just you know some blood curdling scream that she let out come running towards us and of course I'm like no Hayden don't run, don't run, but she said that something had taken it, it's like it took its fingers and just rubbed it from the top of her head all the way down.

It's Kashmir and that's closely followed by water. And I think the two of them are very intricately related. Because in 2005 we had a publication called Final Settlements, which the basic crux of the point of the publication was that Kashmir is as much about water as it is about land. address the aspect of water when it comes to Kashmir. You know the Indus river which is shared by both India and Pakistan, the western rivers, all of them flow through Kashmir and into Pakistan. So there is a very clear agenda on the part of Pakistan to make sure that these waters that flow in from the western rivers of the Indus are secure. And for that reason they are interested in Kashmir as much for the water as they are for the land. In fact, you know in 2005 President Musharraf had come up with something called the Chinab formula which is really interesting and the Chinab formula had said that they would like parts of Jammu and usually when you talk about Pakistan and India problems over Kashmir you are mainly dealing with the valley but this was based on a plan that also segregated a part of Jammu and said we will give parts of Jammu and the valley will have a referendum Parts of Jammu will go to Pakistan and the reason mainly for that is because the Chinab flows through Jammu which is one of the western rivers of the India. So very clearly Kashmir and water they are both very important points when it comes to India and Pakistan and their problems and they are both very intricately related. the view that when you talk about the sectarian or religious aspect of it, it's only the surface. It's probably the most talked about issue when it comes to India and Pakistan. That Pakistan is a majority Muslim state, Kashmir is a majority Muslim state and India is a majority Hindu country. But the aspect of resources has become very important, So you believe it's water more than the land that is important to us? and security interests. But very rarely do we actually pinpoint that water is a big problem. And you know both of these countries are mainly, they have a very huge agricultural sector that is very dependent on water. If you look at any country actually and you look at what sectors use water, industrial and domestic or municipal sectors use a very small percentage of water, maybe 20% or 40%. 60 to 80% percent of that water is useful, irrigation and agriculture. And Pakistan and India are very dependent on that. As the population grows, the food security needs grow, then so will like this need for water. Similarly, even electricity, part of electricity is generated through these high-dow projects. So these will all for the future, they will be very important aspects. And I think, yeah, water is very important. You may have mentioned water is an important issue, but see, media bites are politicians. going to render Pakistan barren there because 90% of the water that Pakistan depends on comes from the industry. So, it's very important. I take your point that water is as important as the issue as liquid, just from the fact that Kashmir is an important issue.","With the first question, I think like the crux there are two main points of contention as far as India and Pakistan is concerned.

If you look at any country actually, and you look at what sectors use water, industrial and domestic or municipal sectors use a very small percentage of water, maybe 20% or 40%. percent of that water is useful, irrigation and agriculture. And Pakistan and India are very dependent on that. As the population grows, the food security needs grow, then so will like this need for water. Similarly, even electricity, part of electricity is generated through these Hydel projects. So these will all for the future, they will be very important aspects. And I think, yeah, water is very important. You may have mentioned water is an important issue but see media bites are politicians. going to render Pakistan barren there because 90% of the water that Pakistan depends on comes from the industry. So, it's very important. So, I take your point that water is as important as the issue as liquid, just from the fact that Kashmiri is an important issue."

I went to the school to sketch my own neighborhood and paint at school. I went to the school to draw my neighborhood background. My friend sitting behind me saw the sketch I drew. She said, I drew a lot of girls, but I think she drew this sketch for me. She said she drew it for me. I said, I drew it for you. So she told me not to lie. I hit a child with this much force. You lied to her. So I got a fear of art time. I loved drawing and my sisters also draw well. But I couldn't draw well after that. Now I'm a little relaxed. Now, when I see the good new writers' paintings, I'm going to collect rice dolls. I was really interested in drawing. I actually drew a big brother in elementary school. He was the best in the world.

I'm the producer of the event, and I'm the producer of the event. I was able to win with my heart, but this is a really embarrassing story. I'm okay. I also look at it and think it's really cool and it's really beautiful. Especially the gold kanji is the feeling of raising the sense of luxury. It's a great thing as a package. I was born in the first generation of the Japanese. I played in the US for a few years. I thought about what I could do to improve my career. I wanted to be healthy and have a good age. The vegetables are also included in the rice, so the vegetables are also healthy. The best-growing zone of the Gindara and the small pine trees are also perfect. I'm enjoying the taste of the soup, but the most important thing is the taste. I'm looking forward to the taste of this soup. I'm going to eat this. I'm going to eat this. I'm going to eat this.

It is ideal to take it with something that is low-calorie and high-calorie products. It is not usually difficult to take it naturally, but it is ideal to take it like this. I think you can ask me to do it. I think it's the best way to make a comment about the kind of dad you're interested in. Before practicing or before the game, basically, you should take a short break. After the movement is over, you can take a short break. But now, in short breaks, you can change the oil rather than taking a short break. or go to the breast or eat at least a few dead bodies. Also, if you're a player, you have to take a lot of vegetables. If you're tired of taking the nutrients you want from the body, or if you're tired of the contents of the game, you have to take care of the things you like. I thought about this while I was talking, but this player is not a recent player. I think that's a good thing. I don't think everyone is excited. I'm sure they're excited about the game. I'm looking forward to it. I recommend any of them. It's delicious. The last event I produced was very specific and healthy. I finished it. Thank you for watching!"

Светлый по поводу манеров, поведения с ними, общения с ними. Спасибо. Когда у нас были программы с участием коллекторов, очень неоднозначное к ним отношение в обществе. Но бизнес достаточно выгодный. Выгодные, я сомневаюсь, что он выгодный. Знаете, вот всегда задавайте себе вопрос. Но тем не менее, коллекторские компании активно выкупают банковские страховые долги. Я думаю, что для определения любого бизнеса нужно посмотреть, занимаются ли бизнесом таким богатые люди. И когда вы видите, что в этом бизнесе нет богатых людей, то делайте вывод, не зачем этим и заниматься. А коллекторские компании, которые может быть выкупают, может быть единицы и могут себе позволить выкупить чужие кредиты. А на самом деле коллекторские компании обычно заключают договоры с банками на то, чтобы получать деньги с клиентов. Я не видел таких уж успешных. Даже вот одна компания приехала, по-моему из Польши приехали тут заниматься этим. Ну очень простой бизнес. Ну софер. Просто звонить по телефонам и досаждать клиенту. Не знаю как на этом можно заработать деньги, может быть кто-то и зарабатывает. Массово вряд ли здесь заработаешь, потому что люди за свои... А вот как вопрос был нашего слушателя, как себя с коллекторами вести? Сложно, что то есть если вы придумаете бизнес на то что сейчас лежит вокруг киева очень много стройматериалов валяется буквально на улице стоят торговцы прямо с машинных продают думайте что как это скомпелировать и что с этим делать в общем то сейчас ниш много открытых поэтому рвитесь бой рисуйте свое убойное предложение когда идете проект предлагать не забывайте что у вас в руках должна быть картинка будущего этого проекта визуализируйте обязательно ее Здравствуйте, Виктория. Здравствуйте, Геннадий. Хочет спросить Геннадия, можно ли у вас в агентстве заработать стартовый капитал? Ищи такой вопрос, можно ли у вас в том щитство вести правильно агентство движимости? Что делать его нужно? И нужно ли большой стартовый капитал для того, чтобы отдельно вести свое агентство недвижимости? Подобное как у вас. Можете ли вы это научить? Попасть на совет? парклайна они работают по всему киву у них огромное количество офисов это одно направление а у меня совершенно противоположное как всегда пошел противоположное я взял одну улицу две и сижу только на них никуда не двигаюсь вот какой из них успешнее я не знаю направление но на то надо больше денег на маленький агентс надо меньше денег вот риэлтером могу посоветовать объединитесь в группу 4-5 человек возьмите в аренду небольшую квартирку и возьмите рядом в квартальчик в 5 минутах Психология грошей цифру 7 стоит, это 5 гривен, плюс NDS, 7% пенсионный фон. Слушаем звонок. Здравствуйте. Можно ставить перед вами задача, что на выходе хотел бы получить. И в какими еще политиками вы работали? Спасибо за вопросы. Как политический психолог не могу сказать, какими политиками я работала? Конфиденциальности. По поводу Кличко, я ему сделал убойное предложение в спортзале. Я захотел быть тренером чемпиона мира по боксу. Я сказал, что можно поправить твою речь, если в это определенную методику. Прогресса заметен А у нас ещё звонок. Здравствуйте. Фанки бизнес на меня в свое время произвела огромное впечатление. Рекомендую всем почитать. Это вот неординарный взгляд на обычные вещи. Два шведских профессионала написали. Том Питерс очень замечательный книг. Достаточно дорогая книга в цветной обложке. Он пишет прекрасные именно бизнесе. Но на больших компаниях, но это можно применять и на малых компаниях. Больше я беру с эволюционной психологией Палмара. Мне кажется, что это для бизнеса. и умения продать. Вот слово продать уже, а то есть больше психологии.","Psychology of money. I am not interested in this. I would like to ask a question about the current development of the collective business in Ukraine. I doubt that he is profitable. You always ask yourself a question. However, collector's companies actively buy bank insurance debts. So, is it necessary? To determine any business, you need to see if they are engaged in a business of such rich people. And when you see that there are no rich people in this business, then make a conclusion. Do not do it. Collector's companies that can be bought, can be units and can afford to buy other people's loans. In fact, collector companies usually sign contracts with banks to get money from clients. I have not seen such successful ones. Even one company came from Poland to do this. It is a very simple business. Just call on the phone and meet the client. I do not know how to earn money, maybe someone will earn money. It is unlikely that you will earn money here, because people are for their own. They are not afraid of law, they are not protected, they can't do anything. It's worse when the collectors are bandits. Now it's not practiced, thank God, not in the beginning of the 90s. Officially, go to the police and write that they treat you. This is the best protection. By the way, in my opinion, the law was not accepted. And it is difficult to move, and the collector's companies themselves are quite weak. The banks are not jealous of this. On the other hand, they take money and they don't give them money. The country is jealous. But I will remind you that the crisis is ending now. I have already experienced two crises in my business life. I can tell you that we are now at the very beginning of the crisis. There are many niches. The banks have already started to offer loans of 18% in the U.S. The interest rates are clearly decreasing. I think that by the end of the year there will be more offers. To be honest, there are no good offers. There are no good offers that are made evenly. Pay attention to the current impotence. There are factories, there are empty workshops. At this base, you can always organize a business or draw a picture and offer investors. If you think about it, think about the business that is lying around now. There are a lot of construction materials lying around Kyiv, literally on the street, there are shopkeepers selling from cars. Think about how to compile it, what to do with it. In general, the mission is now open. So break the battle, draw your battle proposal. And when you go to the project, do not forget that you should have a picture of the future of this project in your hands. Visualize it, be sure. Hello, Victoria. Hello, Gennady. Can you, as an agency, earn a capital start? Can you manage to make the agency move? What is needed? My agency is located on Shilkovich street 17.5, there is a director, she is collecting, she wants to expand the broker, she will tell you the rules how she works, I can teach this to my vision, I can say my vision of the agency, there are two directions of the agency, there are large rail companies, They work in all the offices, they have a huge number of offices, this is one direction, and I have a completely opposite position, I have always gone opposite. I took one street, two, and I'm just sitting on them, I'm not moving anywhere. I don't know which of them is more successful, but on that, I need more money, on a small agency, I need less money. I can advise the Realtor, join a group of 4-5 people, take a small apartment in the rental, and take a quarter in 5 minutes, Psychology of money The number of the 7 is worth 5 hryvnia plus NDS and 7 percent pension fund. Can you tell us what you would like to get from the competition? And what other policies did you work with? Thank you for your questions. I can't say what policies I worked with. Confidenciality. About Klitschko, I made him a combat proposal in the gym. I wanted to be a world champion coach in boxing. I said that you can correct your speech if you have a certain method. I don't know about progress. Why should you listen to him? We've been through it all. But as I thought, he improved his speech. We have a call. Hello. We didn't say about the book. Yes, the book. 3000 original. And then we'll see. We're listening to you. Hello. Hello. You have such a question. Does the book read by the business of Gennady himself? And if so, what are the... 16th of August. What books do I read? I was impressed by the fact that I was able to read this book. It is an extraordinary view on ordinary things. Two Swedish professionals wrote this book. Tom Peters is a very good book. He writes great books in a colorful cover. He writes great books about business. But he is a big company. But he can be used by small companies. But I take more evolutionary psychology of Palmer. The level of the development of a person is very important, because in evolutionary psychology, it is said that the development of a person can be used in personal relationships. My son asked me what I should study to be successful in business in the modern world. I told him that there are two things that are important. One is to invent a project, to study how to invent a project and sell it. This is personal interaction, this means psychology. I would recommend these two things to the young people to pay attention to this. I can sell. The word to sell is more about psychology."

What do you consider your most valuable asset? What is the one thing that if you lost it would not make you you? Now think I want you to think about any time you are in a work situation or on a team situation Who is that one person either at work or on your team that you guys could not perform the same way without? Every professional sports league has the most valuable player award and in most The 2007-2008 MVP race was no different with three players who had a legitimate shot at the award. LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Chris Paul of the New Orleans Tornits, and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. The award was ultimately awarded to Kobe Bryant, but I think Chris Paul and Chris Paul finished a close second. It is my belief that Chris Paul finished a close second. to take the award. By looking at the history of the award and comparing Kobe Bryant's and Chris Paul's stats as well as their impact on their team, I will convince you that Chris Paul should have been the 2008 NBA MVP Award. The National Basketball Association, according to www.mba.com, has been awarding its most valuable player award since 1956. The winner receives a Maurice Poldoff trophy, who was named after the league's first commissioner. Originally the award was voted on by the NBA players. However, in 1980, the 1981 season, a panel of 125 sports riders from Canada and the United States voted on the award. The award is given in the middle of the playoffs, therefore advancement into the playoffs really doesn't factor into the award. Notable winners were Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks who won two MVP awards and won the first award, which was awarded in the 1956 season as I stated earlier. Of course, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bowl The winners of the other note are Magic Johnson, 2-1-3, Karim Doljabar, 1-6, and most recently, Dirk Nowitzki, 1-0-6-0-7. The Lakers did have a 57-25 record. They won the Western Conference Champs and they also were the Pacific Division Champs in the Western Conference. But let's remember now that the award isn't given based on the awards given in the middle of the playoffs. So them advancing to the Western Conference Championship or the actually NBA Finals really did not factor in to the voting. 21 points per game, 11.6 assists and 2.7 steals. His team, the New Orleans Hornets, were 56 and 26 and they won the Southwest Division and the NBA Western Conference. Now, although Chris Paul's team had a slightly lower record than the Lakers, Chris Paul's impact was greater. As he accounted with, as although Kobe Bryant averaged more points a game, Chris Paul's 11.6 assists. made him and plus his 21.6 points made him gave him about 50% of his team's scoring. Now finally I want to look at the league rankings. Chris Paul was 19th in scoring but first in assists and first in steals. Kobe Bryant was third in scoring but did not rank significantly in any other category. So who's more value brother team? Chris Paul or Kobe Bryant? After reviewing the statistics and the categories in which Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul led and the importance each individual had in considering the postseason event and the impact each individual had on their team and considering once again that postseason advancement does not factor in the MVP voting, I think it is safe to say that Chris Paul should have been the 2007-2008 NBA MVP.

But I find these sort of books, e.g. a series of unfortunate events are fantastic when you're reading a book, and it's a very simple book, and it's very easy to read. reading like a long series like Harry Potter and you're playing through one of the longer books, sort of six, seven hundred pages long. It's taking a long time to get through and you want a little break but you don't want to be getting your teeth stuck into something too deep that's going to take you a long time to finish. This should read in a matter of days depending on how quick you are. Even in the eye, it could read just as a little breakbook. And they're fantastic even though the words are small. This is the Midgeable Mill which is the fourth one. I want them all because I just love them. I've got the first one on my Kindle. and I have a couple of other ones. You don't need to read them in order by the way. I got that in a deal so I picked it up. Next book is Quidditch to the Ages, which is written by JK Rowling. Not kinda sure about this one because it's not really a book, it's more, well it is a book, but it's more like a little piddly thing, it's not really, never mind, I'm gonna give it to read, it looks great. It's part of the comic relief. There are just a couple of books for comic relief and this is one of them. And you've got, it's all about Quidditch. And you've got this section in it which is like, I love it I bought this from a charity shop, I know reading with Jack won't like because the spine is broken. But never mind. I got this for 70p out of a charity shop so I've got a lot of them. Actually I've got those three and a couple others. I don't have those two though. So I'm trying to collect the whole series of them. So I picked this one up and apart from the cover being a bit tattered, the pages to read are fine and the spine is broken though.

Ракетный удар будет нанесен по ядерным объектам Ирана силами США и их союзников. Министерство обороны уверены, что США могут ускорить принятие планов по нанесению ракетного бомбового удара по некоторым ключевым иранским объектам. Британские официальные лица заявляют, что если в Ушингтон начнет продвигать этот план, то он будет искать и, конечно, получит воинную поддержку Великобритании в любой операции, несмотря даже на внутреннее разногласие в правящем коалиционном кабинете. полагают, что иранские ядерные программы может быть совсем немедленно. Якобы ЦИРУ и МИ-6 получили сведение, что Иран вроде начал переводить свои центрифуги для обогащения урана в укрепленные подземные бункеры. Они размещены под основанием горы и расположены на военной базе в районе города Кум. По оценкам западных военных экспертов, течение года все иранские центрифуги окажутся в этих бункерах, и после этого их будет невозможно уничтожить даже ракетным ударом. А вот обогащенный уран, как опасаются в Лондоне и Вашингтоне, может быть использован для создания ядерного оружия и по данным журналистов Гару. В ожидании возможного нападения британские военные стратегии определяют, где в течение ближайших месяцев лучше всего разместить корабли и подводные лодки королевского флота, оснащенные крылатыми ракетами Томагавка. Это станет частью будущей войны компании, которая будет вестись на море и в воздухе. Израильский газет «Еджеруселимпост» там сообщил, что Израиль уже имеет готовый план нанесения авиаудара по иранским ядерным объектам. Планируется применить якобы более сотни самолетов, разбомбить подземные исследовательские центры, а сам план авиаудара включает и уничтожение следств ПВО арабских стран, которые будут находиться на пути пролет и израильских эскадриль, если те попытаются сбивать израильские бомбардировщики и штурмовики. А сегодня президент США на САМТ-G20 заявил, что иранская ядерная программа представляет угрозу. сегодня круг вопросов, связанных с безопасностью. Один из них, на котором я хотел бы заострить внимание, это непрерывные угрозы, которые представляют и отдельная программа Ирана. И президент Сарказии и я уверены, что мы должны осуществлять беспрецедентное давление на Иран, чтобы заставить его выполнить свои обязательства. Генсек Натарасмуссон поспешил заявить, что и северо-атлантический Альянс никаких операций в Ираке не планируют, что, впрочем, ни о чем не говорить. Перед началом операции в Ливии он заявлял почти то же самое. Впрочем, США и Британия вполне могут упойти себе с НАТО. По данным газеты «Гарди» на кончене, Родные города","The US will be able to accelerate the adoption of plans to launch a missile bomb attack on some key Iranian objects. British officials say that if Washington begins to promote this plan, it will seek and of course get military support from the United States. Great Britain will not even look at the internal disagreement in the right coalition office. They believe that the Iranian nuclear program may be completely immeasurable. allegedly, CIA and M6 have received information that Iran has started to translate its centrifuges to enrich uranium in the fortified underground bunkers. They are placed under the base of the mountain located at the military base in the city of Qum. According to the estimates of Western military experts, throughout the year all Iranian centrifuges will be in these bunkers and after that it will be impossible to destroy them even by a missile strike. But the enriched uranium, as it is found in London and Washington, can be used to create nuclear weapons and, according to journalists, The future war is expected to be a possible attack. The British military strategy determines where to place the ships and submarines of the Royal Navy, which are equipped with winged missiles and a tomahawk. This will be part of the future war campaign, which will take place on the sea and in the air. The ground operation in Iran is not yet planned, but certainly part of the Spetsnaz will be in the Iranian territory. In general, the scenario resembles only the final operation in Libya. The Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post reported that Israel already has a plan to launch an air strike on Iranian nuclear objects. It is planned to use more than a hundred planes, to bomb underground research centers, and the air strike plan itself includes destroying the Arab countries' air force, which will be on the way to the Israeli air force flights. If those are trying to destroy Israeli bombers and assaults. Today the President of the United States, the G-20, has stated that the Iranian nuclear program is a threat. to be watching today the issue related to security. One of them, which I would like to draw attention to, is the continuous threats that the Iranian single program represents. And the President of the Caucasus and I are sure that we must implement unprecedented pressure on Iran to make it fulfill its obligations. Genesek Natarasmussen hastily announced that the North Atlantic Alliance has no plans to operate in Iraq, which, in fact, does not say anything. Before the start of the operation in Libya, he stated almost the same thing. In fact, the United States and Britain can quite go without NATO. According to the State Security Service, The final decision on the strike on Iran is not accepted now. It seems that Barack Obama would not want to start the war in the year of elections. However, he may be forced to change his opinion if he gets some additional information. The time of the decision will be decided in spring 2012. And the time of the two of them is 200."

It's about the way our students and their information needs are changing and how we need to adjust to that new reality. For the last three years, I've been running the Arcadia project at Cambridge University Library. This is a project whose overall aim is to explore the role of an academic library in a digital environment. And one of the things we realised very early on is that the way we think about info skills, the information needs that contemporary students have, and the way we see support the librarians and teachers needs a really radical overhaul. So we embarked on an ambitious project to design a new curriculum for what in the end we were calling information literacy, ANSIL for short. Now in thinking about this new curriculum we adopted two basic design principles. The first is that information literacy is not just a concern for libraries and librarians. It's something that should concern anyone involved in the teaching process. This is not just because information literacy in a digital world is a necessary condition for becoming an independent learner at university. It's also increasingly important for employability and for surviving in a world where most information, for example, about health and illness, will only be available online. So by taking information literacy seriously, we'll be helping our institutions to turn on well-rounded graduates, no matter what their degree subject is. The second design principle for the new curriculum is that there's no one-size-fits-all prescription. university, every department, every subject is different. So what we came up with is a package that is very flexible and that you can adapt to your needs. So we're not saying that this is how information literacy should be taught, only that it's really important for the sake of our students, our institutions and our society that we take it seriously and not treated as a service to be delegated or outsourced to the library. There's an old saying that war is too important to be left to the general. Well, information literacy is now too important to be left to the librarians. Information literacy matters because it's the foundation of learning. It's not just the ability to find information, it's also the ability to use it, to judge it, to evaluate it critically at the highest intellectual level. This means that information literacy, like learning, is everybody's business in the university because we are all here to support student learning. What's different about ANSEL is that it provides a practical and learner-focused approach. This helps students to develop not just as discerning scholars but as independent and lifelong learners. Ansel is modular, it supports the entire learning journey. It doesn't just outline ideal levels of ability. Ansel defines ten aspects or strands of information literacy that span the entire gamut of learning.

It could also be used as a benchmarking tool to inform learning outcomes and course design.

All the different sectors in the university may provide some information literacy skills teaching and the toolkit can be used to identify where duplication is taking place and who is actually best equipped to deliver the teaching. It also encourages staff to identify their own best practice and where they might need to develop their skills and improve their delivery.

It was produced in 1946, but the political and social concepts appear just as valid in today's world. The markers and tests beg the question about the potential for contemporary despotism in the United States, and other countries.","Governments, Despotism, State (polity), war, Despotic",35,2,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/EGBI222_Group Project_1/audio/wGKN-V4aXvk.mp3,"You can roughly locate any community in the world somewhere along a scale running all the way from democracy to despotism. One to the democracy end, another somewhere in the middle, and a third, let's find out about despotism. This man makes it his job to study these things. Well for one thing, avoid the comfortable idea that the mere form of government can of itself safeguard a nation against despotism. One nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Workable yardsticks help in discovering how near a community is to despotism. The respect scale and the power scale. A careful observer can use a respect scale to find how many citizens get an even break. As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people. A community is low on a respect scale. If common courtesy is withheld from large groups of people, on account of their political attitudes. If people are rude to others because they think their wealth and position gives them that right, or because they don't like a man's race or his religion, equal opportunity for all citizens to develop useful skills is one basis for rating a community on a respect scale. The opportunity to develop useful skills is important, but not enough. The equally important opportunity to put skills to use is a further test on a respect scale. A power scale is another important yardstick of despotism. It gauges the citizen's share in making the community's decisions. Communities which concentrate decision making in a few hands, rate low on a power scale, and are moving towards despotism. Like France under the Bourbon Kings, one of whom said, the state, I am the state. Today, democracy can ebb away What I say goes, see? I'm the law around here. can vote only the way they're told, a community approaches despotism. When legislatures become ceremonial assemblies only, and have no real control over lawmaking, their community rates low on a power scale. In a downright despotism, opposition is dangerous whether the despotism is official or whether it is unofficial. The spread of respect and power in a community is influenced by certain conditions, which many observers measure by means of the economic distribution and information scales. If a community's economic distribution becomes slanted, its middle income groups grow smaller, and despotism stands a better chance to gain a foothold. And is privately owned, one sign of a poorly balanced economy is the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a very small number of people. lose their farms they lose their independence. This one can stay on but not as his own boss anymore. To the extent that this condition exists throughout a nation the likelihood of despotism is increased. In communities which depend almost entirely on a single industry such as a factory or mine maintaining economic balance is a challenging problem. If this condition exists over the nation as a whole so that the control of of jobs and business opportunities is in a few hands, despotism stands a good chance. Another sign of a poorly balanced economy is a taxation system that presses heaviest on those least able to pay. A larger part of a small income is spent on necessities such as food. Sales taxes on such necessities hit the small income harder. In the days of the salt tax, feudal despotisms were partly sustained by this and other effects. A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people and when citizens have to accept what they're told. In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance. See how community trains its teachers. Bear this in mind. Young people can be trusted to form their own opinions. This business about open-mindedness is nonsense. It's a waste of time trying to teach students who think for themselves. It's our job to tell them. And when teachers put such training into practice, despotism stands a good chance. These children are being taught to accept uncritically whatever they're told. Questions are not encouraged. Oh, can you ask such a question? Have you got a textbook? Yes, ma'am. Does it say here that our law courts are always just? Yes, ma'am. Then how dare you question the fact? Sit down. And so we aren't surprised when... But it must be true. I saw it in this book right here. And if books and newspapers and the radio are efficiently controlled, the people will read and accept exactly what the few in control want them to. Government censorship is one form of of control. A newspaper which breaks the government censorship rule can be suspended. It is also possible for newspapers and other forms of communication to be controlled by private interests. I thought I told you to kill that story. It'll cost us a lot of advertising. If that story goes out, I quit. All right. What sort of community do you live in? Where would you place it on a democracy, despotism scale? To find out, you can rate it on a recent and a power scale. And to find out what way it is likely to go in the future, you can rate it on economic distribution and information scales. The lower your community rates on economic distribution and information scales, the lower it is likely to rate on respect and power scales. And thus, to approach despotism.

Herr Schmidt, 1 zu 0 für Griechenland könnte man dieses Wochenende überschreiben, denn die Griechen haben gewählt und ein Jahr zum Euro gesagt. Haben sich die nervösen Märkte jetzt etwas beruhigt? Wichtig wird sein, dass die Griechen relativ schnell eine Regierung bilden und mit den Wahlen ist in Griechenland die Euro-Krise eigentlich nicht beendet. Wir hatten einen Dachs, der 1,3 Prozent fester war heute Morgen. Inzwischen ist die Partie schon wieder etwas vorbei. Momentan der Dachs bei 6.280 plus 0,8 Prozent. Auch der Euro war über der 1,27 heute in der Früh und ist auch schon wieder auf dem Rückzug. ist dazu ihre Einschätzung. Wir haben nach wie vor Spanien, die vor dem Abgrund stehen. Wir haben Italien mit dem Rücken zur Wand. Dabei liegt jetzt eigentlich bei der Politik, die eben einen sinnvollen Plan präsentieren müssen für die Vereinigten Staaten von Europa. Bei aller eurozentrischen Betrachtungsweise, die wir gerade pflegen, lassen Sie uns einen kurzen Blick über den großen Teich machen. Diese Woche wird die Fett tagen. Was halten Sie davon? Die schlechten Konjunkturdaten der letzten Woche haben wieder die Erwartungen geschürt, dass die Fett vielleicht doch am Markt durch Anlei, Käufe wieder tätig sein könnte. Allerdings hat Bernanke bei einer Anhörung vor dem Kongress eigentlich gesagt, dass keine weiteren Maßnahmen der Fett derzeit geplant sind. Wir haben auch in Deutschland wieder Konjunkturdaten, zum Beispiel den ZTV-Konjunkturindex oder den IFO-Geschäftsklima-Index. Allerdings muss man sagen, diese Konjunkturdaten werden natürlich überschattet werden, wie es weitergeht in Europa, wie es weitergeht mit Griechenland und wie schnell die Regierungsbildung in Griechenland vorankommt. Vielen Dank für diese Einschätzung. Sie haben es gehört, Griechenland bleibt im Zentrum des Interesses. Eines wissen wir nächsten Montag mit Sicherheit, ob Griechenland oder Deutschland weiter ist bei der EM. In diesem Sinne bis zum nächsten Montag.","Hello and hello to the weekly market view of Börse Munich. Mr. Schmidt, one to zero for Greece could be overwritten this weekend, because the Greeks have voted and said yes to the euro. Did the nervous nerves calm down a bit now? After winning the conservative in Greece, there were certain financial markets. The emergency management of the bank of the bank in the case of a crash must not be attacked. The question is how long does this positive mood last? It would be important that the Greeks quickly form a government and with the elections Greece is not the Euro crisis. We had a DAX that was 1.3% more solid this morning. In the meantime, the party is a bit past. At the moment the DAX is at 6,280 plus 0.8%. The Euro was also in the early 27th and is back on the back again. What is your opinion on this? We have the Spanish, the ones who are standing in the background, we have Italy with the back of the wall. The ball is now actually in politics, which must present a meaningful plan for the United States of Europe. In all Eurocentric way of view, which we are currently taking care of, let us have a brief look at the big pond. This week the fat will be weighed. What do you think of it? The bad conjecture data of the last week have again been reaffirmed the expectations that the fat may but it could be a market where the supply and demand could be re-operated. However, Bernanke said that there is no further measurement of the fat that is planned at the congress. We also have data from Germany such as the ZTV Connector Index or the Ivo-Geschäftsklimmer Index. However, I must say that these data will be overlooked, how it will continue in Europe, how it will continue with Greece and how quickly the government education in Greece will arrive. Thank you for this assessment. You heard it. Greece remains in the center of interest. One thing we know next Monday with security. Whether Greece or Germany is further away from the EU. In this sense, see you next Monday."

Today, the fifth match of the tournament and the fifth match of the tournament won. With the number of 4 players, one of them is against the last match of the day, here is Hat Hunter. There is Francis, Moran Michel. Moran Michel is 75 kilos, he is 400 grams. At 28 years old, Hat Hunter is 34 years old, 82 kilos. Let's follow him carefully. Now Hat Hunter's dear viewers, you know it's not certain. He gives his score like a star. And now they are arm wrestling. Look at the French's foot. A nice lob kick came from the headhunter. Both lob kick and a sweep. Push kick to the knee. The same punch from the racket. This is the final level. A high-quality match. A hit from the headhunter. The headhunter is not just his size. He also started using his legs. A great right-hand hit from the headhunter. A great professional. There is nothing to say.

Hattunter has a great body structure. Hattunter is very thin. Therefore, he makes those moves very comfortably. Now, the opponent is coming over Michel Moran. And Hattunter has not shown a very important bar yet. Actually, he is opening very well. Until the top, he is the first and second hit. But Michel Moran is closing all of them. He has made a 24-match match at 28 years old. He has won 15 matches. The last two weeks were over. The last two weeks were over. The last two weeks were over. The last two weeks were over.

The height is up again, the height of the opponent. My cookie. He is making the opponent knock-out, he is lowering them, he is doing these moves very well. I'm telling the same thing. I have a 84 kg body, it is about 3-4 times more than the competition. It is not easy like a helicopter. He has to congratulate him in the next game. He is a great master and a great experienced player like Ethanter. He is a great player. Look, he is still in the first round. We are feeling him in a heavy way. He is following closely. Now he is coming to France."

But, finally, I was watching that you were working for the burro. The owner is Vido and Lucelas. We are talking about Borne, the concerts that we are doing in March.

Mais c'est vraiment un endroit particulier et une beauté terrifiant. On peut vraiment avoir le mal de l'Akpauel. D'ailleurs, l'Akpauel, le cercle sacré, change de couleur Toutes les heures. Et ce qui est amusant dans le tableau de mon ami Juan Kitty, c'est que ça change aussi. Ça n'est pas statique. Vous parlez de 3D. Quand vous êtes en Arizona, vous regardez la qu'Poël, c'est un paysage lunaire, révolutionnaire lunaire, début du monde, on y voit des dinosaures, on y trouve d'ailleurs des scolaires des dinosaures, on y voit tout. Et c'est pas par hasard que John Ford a été là et que plus tard on a tourné la planète des change à cet endroit. Le roi rouge vous êtes revenu au western financier donc l'an dernier avec ce roman qui apparaît aux éditions du rocher. Est-ce que ça vous dit ça veut dire que vous êtes revenu dans cette vanne dans cette inspiration ? Je crois beaucoup au fond le monde financier. Oui aujourd'hui on parle il y a une crise mondiale. Vous savez Brice qui a 15 ans j'ai annoncé cette crise. Et on n'a aucun mérite vous savez les gens qui sont en avance souffrent beaucoup. Par exemple Torquelmada. Il ne fallait pas le dire. Moi, j'ai dit que le système capitaliste connaîtra une crise aussi grave que le système communiste. Parce qu'il a perdu le sens des valeurs. C'est vrai que à l'époque de le grand-parent, on faisait une entreprise, on avait des gens qui travaillaient, mais ils faisaient partie de la famille. On s'est éloignés de toute humanité dans la société capitaliste. Et la crise est arrivée, avec elle, son lot d'escrits colossaux, qui a commencé avant de racheter les hommes comme on l'achète du bétail et qui ne tenait aucune, ni des sentiments, ni même, je dirais, moi qui suis plus capillé que communiste, même de l'homme lui-même. L'homme est devenu une marchandise. Il n'avait plus de valeur. Et cette société, moi j'ai écrit ça il y a 15 ans, est condamnée. Elle est condamnée comme l'île communiste. Elle est condamnée parce que c'est loin de trop de l'homme artistes, les truquins, du créatif parce qu'au fond si on prend des grands hommes d'affaires de l'époque c'était des grands créateurs voire de grands artistes. Ils construisaient un empire sur une idée, prenons l'exemple, je ne peux pas citer de marques mais une boisson célèbre, c'est un pharmacien qui alcenta, avait mal au coeur, il voyait ses enfants, il a mis au point, il a lancé une boisson. On trouve mille exemples. Quand je dis que la grande aventure moderne, ce n'est pas descendre le climat de Jarro en ski, mais c'est de créer une entreprise en pleine crise en Belgique, c'est vrai que c'est ça la grande aventure. On a perdu aujourd'hui tout rapport avec l'homme, les idées, la création, les artistes, le sens scientifique. D'ailleurs, regardez, quand dans une société il y a quelques années, et vous disiez quel métier faites-vous ? Moi je disais je suis au Mansé, on me disait c'est un métier de cocheur. Ceux qui, barrausement, étaient en partie vrais. Et moi j'ai transformé ce métier à l'époque, comme dans un western, en lançant dans le monde entier ce que j'ai fait et en gagant des millions d'euros, comme un étranger, il a fait. Mais aujourd'hui on est à une charnière, le coblis s'effond dans le monde entier. le capitalisme que l'on retrouve dans le roi rouge, le romanvé appublié l'année dernière. Vous avez demandé si vous n'alliez pas avoir d'ennui avec toutes ces révélations, de la raccossériorie ? Je l'ai ennuite depuis je saisans, c'est pas nous d'ailleurs, on en a largement parlé souvent. Le roi rouge est une histoire à 80% vrai, c'est l'histoire d'un homme à Kadigé Tamak et de l'Angolaget qui a fait un faux vrai procès. en France depuis une affaire d'État dont on a aussi largement parlé où il n'y a pas ce quoi, Mitterrand, Attali, moi-même qui est un maque Falcon, connu aussi sous le nom d'affaires Falcon, le juge corois, il s'appelle le corps de l'aide dans le moment. Bon, il est évident que j'ai raconté dans Moir Rouge un peu ce qui s'est passé en Union ex-Union soviétique quand le myrrh de Berlin s'effondre. Tous ces gens qui sortent de Nupas et qui deviennent nous au riche mais là où il faut 10 générations belchique comme un barbaoïch par exemple que j'ai très bien connu que je connais très bien bon il y a dans le roi rouge une histoire vraie alors ça n'a pas fait plaisir tout le monde j'ai même reçu certaines menaces mais ça me fait pas peur ça me faisait peur avant maintenant j'ai passé ce stade","And in this region, there is in Arizona everything that mystics, Indian science, the ancient of Indians, have brought, including the shamans with the mystic. But it's really a particular place, and a terrifying beauty. We can really have the evil of the Lack-Powell. The Lack-Powell, the sacred circle, changes color, All the hours. What is the use of a picture of my friend Juan Kitty? It changes too. It's not static. You speak 3D. When you are in Arizona, you look at the Poles, it's like a lunar landscape, a lunar revolution, from the beginning of the world. We see dinosaurs, we find them in the schools of dinosaurs. We see everything. And it's not by chance that John Ford was there, and that later we turned the planet of change to this place. You came back to the Western financial world with this novel that appeared in the editions of the Rocher. Does that mean you came back in this vein, in this inspiration? I think a lot. The financial world, yes. Today we are talking about a global crisis. You know, Brice, who is 15 years old, I announced this crisis. We have no merit. People who are in progress suffer a lot. For example, Torquemada, where people who say that the earth is I said that the capitalist system would be in a serious crisis because it lost its value. At the time of the great-grandfather, we were doing an enterprise, we had people who worked, but they were part of the family. We were far from all humanity in the capitalist society. And the crisis came with the water of colossal escrow, who started before buying men from the battle and who had no feelings or even, I would say, me who was more than a communist than a communist, even from the man himself. The man became a merchant. He had no value anymore. And this society, I wrote this 15 years ago, is condemned. It is condemned as the communist's island. It is condemned because it is far from being a man's home, the artist, the human being, the creative one. Because if we take the great men of the time, they were great creators, even great artists. They built an empire on an idea, let's take the example of a famous drink, a famous brand. It was a famous drink that Alcanta had a heartache. He had his children, he had a drink. We find a thousand examples. When I say that the great modern adventure is not going down the Climangiaro in ski, but it is creating a company in the middle of a crisis in Belgium, it is true that this is the great adventure. We have lost today all the relationships with men, ideas, creation, artists, the scientific sense. By the way, when in a society a few years ago, and you said, what business are you doing? I said, I'm a liar. They said, it's a little bit of a lie. Those who, unfortunately, were part of it. And I transformed this business at the time, like in the West End, into the whole world, what I did, and by winning millions of dollars, Koban Asusri did it. But today, we are in a chain, the Koban is the foundation in the whole world. So, this communism and capitalism that we find in the Red King, the republished novel last year, did you ask if you would not have boredom with all these revelations? I have boredom since I was 16. We have often talked about it. The Red King is a story of 80% true. It is the story of a man, Akadigetamak, and Angola Gett, who made a false open process. I was in France for a state affair, which we also talked about. There was Pasqua, Mitterrand, Attali, myself, who was a Mac Falcon, and also known as Falcon's affair. The judge of the court, his name was Cordelette. It is obvious that I told in the Red Moor, what happened in the former Soviet Union, when the Berlin Wall was closed. All those people who left the country and became It's a new rhythm, but where you have to be in the 10th generation in Belgium. I know very well that I'm a very good man. There is a true story in the Red King. It didn't make everyone happy. I even suffered some threats, but it doesn't scare me. It scared me a little before, but now I've gone through this."

In assemblea permanente, lavoratori del cantiere Seta di Nociara Inferiore questa mattina lo hanno ribadito, rionendosi per chiedere scusa ai cittadini, ma anche per accendere ancora una volta i riflettori sulla loro storia. Una vicenda drammatica fatta di promesse, disattese. a Uricchio, nei confronti dei lavoratori. Ci avevano promesso delle rimesse, di questo non è arrivato neanche il 10% di quello che dovevano pensare nelle caste della serie per poter pagare i lavoratori le tremensilità arretrate. Siamo in attesa che la società ci faccia sapere qualcosa. I lavoratori dicono che vogliono uscire ma giustamente vogliono prima i soldi. Il vento forte ha seminato spazzatura ovunque enfatizzando il disagio legato alla mancata raccolta, tanto da suscitare preoccupazione per la situazione genico-sanitaria che precipita. Antonio Gorritore, medico ed ex Consigliere Comunale, annuncia la sua intenzione di rivolgersi alla fede al consumatori perché intervenga con piglio deciso sulla delicata situazione.

The problem is big, no one is seen here. We do not see a division of the city, nor a municipality, nor the politicians. We are waiting for the police to open their arms. We are sorry about the city, because we know that there is no more Montice. Unfortunately, we have reached the culmination of the situation. We are really desperate. We are not even guaranteeing essential services that are important to the hospital. We are sorry but we are now at the maximum of the examination and we can't do anything about it. In permanent assembly, the workers of the Seta district of Nociara Inferiori have been re-bred this morning, gathering to apologize to the citizens but also to welcome once again the reflectors on their history, a dramatic story made of unexpected promises. in the face of the workers. They promised that the remaining of this was not even 10% of what they had to spend in the cash of the company to be able to pay the workers the three monthly fees. We are waiting for the company to let us know something. The workers say they want to leave, but they precisely want to make money. The strong wind has sowed a common disaster, causing the lack of harvest, and the lack of care for the health care situation. the industrial plant of the SETA is the new industrial plant, which with a cutting of 70% of the lower-end service should go down from the current barrel of 600,000 euros monthly to 450, will go to the assembly of the partners on the 15th of March."

The leaders, along with the deputy Enrique Vandrieselver and the leaders of the Andalian Bridge, where they explained the need to start these works in the summer so that the measures taken can minimize possible damage of the next rains. The important thing is that we have time so that these works run well and bring us the transit that is usually complicated for the neighbors with the arrival of the winter months. The work will start at the bridge of the Bayenas to the Nonghien estuary and will allow the correct evacuation of the waters that were flooded in 2006, Collao, Palomares, Nonghien and the entire river of the North Coast that goes to the Andalian River. that the probability of flooding is practically zero.

O se ne è un augurio per questa regione, le vanno nei campagni. ci hanno sempre distrattato, ogni cosa che succede qui viene sempre amplificato, in media ci hanno sempre messo schiaffati in prima pagina. Io mi auguro che saremo in prima pagina per altre cose, anche se siamo un popolo, io dico un po' come Le Aquila, che a volte possono volare più in basso delle galline, ma tante le galline non potranno mai volare in alto come Le Aquila. Sì, molto importante. Io sono uno che mi sento fortunato anche se ho dato tanto nella vita. Il sociale è una cosa importante perché ogni tanto bisogna dare uno sguardo all'indietro per apprezzare quello che uno ha. Siamo sempre abituati a guardare spesso avanti, a conquistare un qualcosa, ma ogni tanto ci sono tante persone che bisogna dargli retta, perché aiutare soprattutto, La canzona è in noi, dimostra proprio questo che è stata scelta dal Ministero della Salute come sigla dello spot della lotta con Colise. per vedere gli ospedali vuoti, così vuol dire che non ci sarà più gente che soffre e vedere il sorriso in pace a tutti.","Gigi D'Alessio returns to the Sarnese lake and tonight, the guests of the city of Scafati, what does it do to return to your people after having toured the whole world? I wanted to go to the Sintaco, a very special person. I wanted to go to the Sintaco last year. I was still studying, I wanted to go last year. I prepared the songs to come here. Last year I didn't go to the Sintaco, this year it was a tournament that will continue. I would like to record a spot that will be used for two programs that I will do on Rai 1, two points, one on 26 February and the other on 26 November. between March 5th and the last two days, all of you are dedicated to me with guests, so I would like to record you in the spot. You will be with the Raid from last year. The directors are coming, they change, but there is no problem. Of course, last year it was my too much exposure to Raid and Mediaset, who made the Raid nervous. Then I go with the Raid and San Garza and Mediaset. Anyway, the important thing is that they want me from both parties. I'm sure my father and my mother did it 42 years ago. Do you also return to the music of the partenope? Or do you sing in Italian? I need to make a classic Apolitan or especially abroad or when there is a need to sing some old success in the dialect just that they give me a strong attitude.

I'm joking, Claudio is the greatest artist, I'm very happy that he invited me to his album, but I think he made too many dreams, the audience gave him a lot, I don't know if he gave enough to the audience, but the important thing is that I'm excited every time, I don't get excited anymore. You will write a song for the beautiful Naples? I already wrote it for my Naples. It seems repetitive to me to always return to the same things. I would rather always want to continue writing songs that can reach people's hearts. Because I think that people still need to love, but above all to be loved. I feel lucky, even if I gave my life so much, but I also gave so much in life. Social is an important thing because every now and then you have to give a look back to appreciate what you have. We are always used to look forward, to conquer something, but every now and then there are many people who need to be helped by others, especially for those who are not I think they understand the true value of life. The song is about you, showing what you've been chosen by the Ministry of Health as the symbol of the spot of the Controlites fight. Yes, we've had this honour to make the honour column for the Controlites fight. I'm not going to stop here. What's still missing? Everything, in what sense? The most beautiful thing I have is the audience that loves me. It's a great responsibility. But what I want, not only for me, but for everyone, to see the hospital empty, so to say that there will be no more people who suffer and see the smile in everyone's face."

These tools and commands are similar to standard ArchiCAD editing commands, but they've been extended to reflect specific MEP requirements and therefore greatly improve your productivity. MEP specific editing operations are available in the floor plan and also in the 3D window. The MEP specific pet palette is always at hand and provides a set of operations specific tools to speed up your editing work. Some basic editing operations, such as Move or Stretch, are available in the section and elevation windows as well. When you edit an MEP element, certain parameters of the connected, yet unselected MEP elements may also change as a result. After completing an editing operation, all modified elements become selected to provide feedback on the scope of the completed operation. Let's select a Duct Bend now, and drag it to a new position. As a result, ARCHICAD will insert new bend elements and straight duct segments to follow the modified route. Flexible duct elements can be freely modified using their hotspots. Let's continue the editing work in the 3D window. As you can see, all PET palette operations are also available in 3D. It takes only a couple of seconds to modify this straight duct element in the 3D window. Various parameters of the MEP elements elements can also be modified in a smart manner. For instance, the shape and the size of the selected MEP ductwork can be changed in one shift. The Edit Selected Elements dialog provides various editing options for the ductwork, pipework, and cable tray elements. For instance, the MEP system of the selected elements can be easily updated. Their 3D representation thickness can also be changed within seconds.","MEP for ArchiCAD provides a set of specific editing tools to help your everyday work. These tools and commands are similar to standard ArchiCAD editing commands, but they've been extended to reflect specific MEP requirements and therefore greatly improve your productivity. MEP specific editing operations are available in the floor plan and also in the 3D window. The MEP specific pet palette is always at hand and provides a set of operations specific tools to speed up your editing work. Some basic editing operations, such as Move or Stretch, are available in the section and elevation windows as well. When you edit an MEP element, certain parameters of the connected, yet unselected MEP elements may also change as a result. After completing an editing operation, all modified elements become selected to provide feedback on the scope of the completed operation. Let's select a Duct Bend now, and drag it to a new position. As a result, ARCHICAD will insert new bend elements and straight duct segments to follow the modified route. Flexible duct elements can be freely modified using their hotspots. Let's continue the editing work in the 3D window. As you can see, all PET palette operations are also available in 3D. It takes only a couple of seconds to modify this straight duct element in the 3D window. Various parameters of the MEP elements elements can also be modified in a smart manner.

Part of planning an accessories program is deciding how much and what kind of specialty product installation you can do in-house. This will depend on the size of your operation, the skill of your technicians, and how much work you can handle. It's a matter of the difference of what it would cost us to have somebody do the entire job as opposed to somebody in our dealership doing the job.

They're all on flat rate. After determining the work you can do in-house, you'll want to partner with specialty product vendors and installers, also known as re-stylers, to expand your accessory sales. In most cases, dealers that are just starting out, they need to set themselves up with a Vindor that does customizing because they're not going to be able to do that. because they're not going to have the personnel in order to just jump right in this with both feet. trends that can build your business. are the quality vendors in town. They may do tops, they may do chrome trim, they may do custom grills, accessories, wheels and tires. A lot of them will either come out and install it at your dealership or pick a car up, take it to their facility. Most dealers find that showroom inventory featuring accessorized models, along with customized vehicles, will draw more potential customers and generate faster sales. The relationship with a restyler should be a partnership that easily fits your installation process. will then pick it up. You have to make sure that you find somebody you can trust and work with. Along with doing quality work, the restyler should know what will sell in your particular location. Your restyler should understand that market because some of the stuff I do at my store here won't work at my other store that's five miles away because the market over there is different where up here I can spend seven or eight and nine thousand dollars and not have it be an issue. While depending on restylers for product knowledge and advice, dealers should avoid giving them free reign to accessorize vehicles for display. If I went to some restyler and all he wanted to do is sell me $10,000 worth of items to be put on the car, I'd want to know what his part is. And you can kind of gather if he just wants to sell me a couple of cars loaded out with a lot of accessories on them. Was this guy really the right person for me? And now any of these on here are not going to avoid any warranties. accessories that you or an outside vendor install. Since these products are not covered by the factory warranty, their installation may void portions of it. Everything that we saw, we warranty for the remainder of the factory warranty, just as if it were a factory option. When I put anything on an automobile and if it's by an outside vendor, they have to duplicate the factory warranty. If they're not willing to duplicate the factory warranty, we're not willing to put their product product on the car who are not willing to use them. You can go to your vendors and just say, look, I have to stand behind whatever you're going to sell me. I need you to stand behind it for four years of 50,000 miles. They may need to add $100 or 50 bucks or 75 bucks to each job that they're doing for you just to kind of set up a little reserve in case something does go wrong. But if they're doing a quality job and they're using quality products, they should last four years or 50,000 miles without any issues. A strong relationship with your restyler is part of the formula for success in accessory sales and can lead to a better profit picture. That's really what it's all about. When you're starting to do these modifications you try things and you start to see what works for you in your area and then the more it works for you, it just makes a commitment to go forward. And it brings the money. It is a touchscreen nav system, Bluetooth phone system and an MP3 player.

I originally come from India, but I've moved to Denmark from US. Actually, I'm now a US citizen. So I call myself an Indian-Origin American. That's the way I call myself. My title is Vice President, Commercial Productivity and Insights within GSMI. And what that involves is basically three pillars, insights definitely, commercial productivity, which is basically RoeMe that is now a very hot topic within the group and then portfolio strategy which is cornerstone which is also pretty well established and embedded within the organization. So I look after those three things, I along with my team. So one of the most challenging things in my job, the way I look at it is just corralling everybody together, ensuring that everybody's on the same page because being a group function, this tends to be a job where we need to go hand in hand with our regions, with the markets, work together. And many times, everybody's not looking or singing of the same page. And therefore, it is very important to get all of them together. And that means we have to have meetings with people. We need to keep, you know, as we move ahead, we need to take everybody with us together, go two steps ahead, and then you realize you have gone one step back and you start all over. But I think that's also the most fascinating part, because you're interacting with so many people. You are understanding different cultures. And that's one of the things I really love about my job. I think for me personally what I find really special about Karlsberg, apart from the brands obviously, is the fact that Karlsberg is at present in a very interesting journey or interesting part of its journey. In its journey to become a global FMCG like company. And I have in my past worked with different multinationals and FMCG global companies. And what I found there was that Everything was kind of set for you and you just come in, fit into a place and just continue working on what was already being developed. There were a few opportunities to do things differently. And what is fascinating and that is what I love about Carlsberg is that we are in a journey where we are still at a process of making things happen and therefore I can play a huge role in actually shaping the future of Carlsberg and that for me is the most fascinating and most interesting part. So one of the most interesting tasks that I've worked with in Carlsberg I would definitely say it's cornerstone that was creating the framework, the Karlsberg Group way of doing portfolio strategy. So the team and I, we worked very closely to understand how our consumers as well as our customers perceive beer in different ways because beer as we know is very different. There are so many aspects of beer, whether it is from a different country, whether it's a different color, pricing whether it's sold in an on trade it's sold in off trade so there's so many as we like to call them different ways of looking at bear different lenses through which you can look at bear and the interesting part was trying to bring this all together and create a framework which will help our markets decide on which of these segments or which of these as we like to call them different areas we want to play in and that is what the portfolio strategy was all about so creating that framework and then ensuring that market actually work with that was one of the most fascinating things. So as human beings all of us want to see our work being recognized because it makes us feel good that people are recognizing the work we do. And I think for me and my team the thing which really makes us feel good is the cornerstone and how cornerstone has got embedded in the organization. I hear from my boss as well as from the XCOM you hear how during all our business planning cornerstone is the foundation around which all the business plans are created or shared. And that makes us feel really good, both the team and I feel really great about the fact that the work that we had created is being used by the markets. And that's the ultimate recognition.","So my name is Vivek. I originally come from India, but I've moved to Denmark from US. Actually, I'm now a US citizen.

He is giving me a nice hand. We will continue to hit him. The game is over in a few seconds. I liked boxing a lot. My favorite boxer is Hong Man Choi, he is not very known. He is a boxing boxer and professional boxer. He fought against Mike Tyson, against... Against Chavez, the father of Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and Julio Cesar Chavez, the legend. Yes, his muse is good, I lost it. Don't worry, I'll give it back, no problem. I don't know if it's 4 or 3 rounds. I don't know the difference. Terran is changing, he doesn't defend the friends he's using. I'm going to kick his ass because he's doing the piola. I started to hit him, he will fall at some point.

At least 43 people, mostly Muslims, died in the violence that erupted after an argument at a Muslim-owned shop. But so far, no Buddhists have been convicted in connection with the deadly clashes.

But as David Granbaugh reports, some of those who were displaced are now returning home to a divided community. community. About 7,000 Muslims and Buddhists who were displaced by the violence in Miktila have returned to their homes. But despite their return, this community remains divided. Thedaatla and her family are back on the block they've lived at for most of their lives. They spent more than a month in a stadium that was turned into a shelter for Muslims displaced by the riots that tore apart Miktila. The family fled their home during the first three days of rioting that started on the 20th of March. It started with a quarrel in a gold shop between two Buddhist customers and the Muslim owners. Soon after the argument, a Buddhist monk was killed, sparking further unrest across Burma. Buddhist monks were involved in the violence that saw Muslims hacked and burned on the streets. A Buddhist nationalist movement led by monks, calling themselves 969, spearheaded, the anti-Muslim sentiments through hate speech and propaganda. The anti-Muslim violence killed at least 43 people and displaced nearly 13,000 Muslims and Buddhists. Muslims were outnumbered, suffered higher casualties and most if not all stayed in shelters through the month of April because it was not safe to return to their neighbourhoods. But now Muslims and Buddhists whose houses were not destroyed have left the shelters and returned home. There are soldiers and police across the city. Special security posts have been set up in neighborhoods where Muslims live. But while the government is taking steps to keep the peace, relationships between the Buddhists and Muslims have not returned to normal. Onkin has lived in Maktila his entire life. He says he has Muslim friends, but since the riots, their relationship has been strained. There are people who say they're getting along with their Muslim and Buddhist neighbours the same as they did before the riots. But those stories seem to be more the exception than the norm. from the same religion as them. The government says it will replace all of the houses that were destroyed in the violence, but little has been rebuilt. Those who do not have houses to return to remain in camps.

At least 43 people, mostly Muslims, died in the violence that erupted after an argument at a Muslim-owned shop. But so far, no Buddhists have been convicted in connection with the deadly clashes. And an atmosphere of anti-Muslim sentiments continue to pervade much of Myanmar. But as David Granbaugh reports, some of those who were displaced are now returning home to a divided community. community. About 7,000 Muslims and Buddhists who were displaced by the violence in Miktila have returned to their homes. But despite their return, this community remains divided. Thedaatla and her family are back on the block they've lived at for most of their lives. They spent more than a month in a stadium that was turned into a shelter for Muslims displaced by the riots that tore apart Miktila. The family fled their home during the first three days of rioting that started on the 20th of March. It started with a quarrel in a gold shop between two Buddhist customers and the Muslim owners. Soon after the argument, a Buddhist monk was killed, sparking further unrest across Burma. Buddhist monks were involved in the violence that saw Muslims hacked and burned on the streets. A Buddhist nationalist movement led by monks, calling themselves 969, spearheaded, the anti-Muslim sentiments through hate speech and propaganda. The anti-Muslim violence killed at least 43 people and displaced nearly 13,000 Muslims and Buddhists. Muslims were outnumbered, suffered higher casualties and most if not all stayed in shelters through the month of April because it was not safe to return to their neighbourhoods. But now Muslims and Buddhists whose houses were not destroyed have left the shelters and returned home. There are soldiers and police across the city. Special security posts have been set up in neighborhoods where Muslims live. But while the government is taking steps to keep the peace, relationships between the Buddhists and Muslims have not returned to normal. Onkin has lived in Maktila his entire life. He says he has Muslim friends, but since the riots, their relationship has been strained. There are people who say they're getting along with their Muslim and Buddhist neighbours the same as they did before the riots. But those stories seem to be more the exception than the norm. from the same religion as them. The government says it will replace all of the houses that were destroyed in the violence but little has been rebuilt. Those who do not have houses to return to remain in camps. In Miktila communal pensions still run deep. A state of emergency is still in place and will be for the next few months."

We are given that y is equal to mx that is a line through the origin is a chord of the circle having radius equals a and whose diameter is along the x axis. We want to find the equation of that circle whose diameter is that chord y equals mx and we also need to find the locus of the center of the circle. Now in order to proceed with this question we make the figure this is a circle whose diameter is is equal to a and which is along the diameter and whose diameter is along the x axis, so its centre will be a comma 0. Now, let us say this is a line p y equals mx and let us call this circle equals s equals 0, which is x minus a whole square plus y minus 0 whole square equals a square. Now, this is our chord and we want to find the equation of that circle which is having diameter this is not a circle, we just need to find the circle whose diameter is this chord. Let us say this is A, this is B. So, we want to find that circle having AB as the diameter. Now, first of all the equation of the given circle is x minus a whole square plus y square equals a square that is x square plus y square minus 2ax equals 0 and a line is this is s and our p line is y minus mx equals 0. 0. So, here we use family concept. The circle passing through the points of intersections of the circle and a given line S and P respectively is given by S plus lambda P equals 0. This we have written using the family concept. The family of lines concept we learnt in straight lines also. Here also we can use the family concept. So, S is x square plus y square minus 2 Ax equals 0 and p is y minus mx equals 0. So, putting in that equation we get the circle will be equal to x square minus y square minus 2 Ax plus lambda times y minus mx equals 0. The center of this circle very clearly can be found out to be equal to 2 plus 2A plus m lambda by 2 comma minus lambda by 2. Now the center since it is lying on the line y equals mx, so it is coordinate will be equal to m times its x coordinate. So, minus lambda by 2 equals m times 2a plus m lambda by 2 which gives minus lambda equals 2am plus m square lambda which gives lambda equals minus 2am upon 1 plus m square. We would rewrite the whole thing again. We have got lambda equals minus 2am upon 1 plus m square. So, circle which was x square plus y square plus square minus 2 A x plus lambda times that is minus 2 A m upon 1 plus m square times y minus m x equals 0 which gives the equation of circle as 1 plus m square into x square plus y square minus 2 A times x plus m y equals 0. Hence we have found out the equation of circle passing through the points of intersection of the line p equals 0 and the circle s equals to 0 that is the circle having the chord y equals mx as the diameter. Now we need to find out the locus of center of this circle. Let us call the center coordinates as h comma k. So, h will be equal to very clearly a upon 1 plus m square and k will be very easily found out directly by since it is m times the x coordinate. So, we can write Now, we need to find the locus of center of this circle. So, we have to eliminate m. So, dividing these two equations, we get k upon h equals m. Putting the value of m in this equation, we will get h equals a upon 1 plus k square by h square that is a h square upon h square plus k square. H and h square get cancelled, we get h square k square equals ah on replacing h by x k by y as we always do we get x square plus y square equals ax which is the desired locus of the center of this circle which we found in the first part of the question. Hence the final answer is this is the equation of the circle and this is the equation or the locus of the center of this circle these are our final answers.","This next question of ours is a very good question.

Als ich zur Update-Video mache, habe ich eine Video über meine Haare. Ja, ich fange jetzt einfach mal an. Also, ich war im Urlaub in Italien mit meinen Freunden und meiner Familie. Es war voll cool. Das zählte meine Nähe von Rimini und dann in Lignano. Ja. Also, was habe ich nur so Neues? Das Live-Lis habe ich für meine besten Freunde von meiner Schwester gekriegt. Ich bin wieder hier reisen. Wow! Voll cool. Ja. Und ja, ich habe die Haare gelockt. Oh mein Gott. Ich werde sofort zum Glätten. Ja, aber ich wollte auch meine Haare in Natur sein. Voll cool. Ja, das habe ich nur so noch. Ich habe weitergedehnt auf acht und jetzt sehen ich noch bald von Sons Mätsam. Weil ich morgen machen oder vielleicht heute noch. Ja, voll cool. In Italien kostet es auch Spreize, einfach nur 3-4 Euro und bei uns 15 oder mehr. Ja, das habe ich noch so noch. Ich habe jetzt einen ganzen Tag zusammengefunden. Ich habe jetzt einen ganzen Tag zusammengefunden. Ich habe jetzt einen ganzen Tag zusammengefunden. Ich habe jetzt einen ganzen Tag zusammengefunden. Ich habe eigentlich braune Haare, ich muss gleich etwas. Aber ich habe jegliche Haare von 12 kurz vor mir gebutzt. Ich habe sie als erstes blau-schatz gefebt. Und dann habe ich sie komplett blau gehabt. Aber ich habe nicht den Dächter als schlauze ausgeschaut, aber in der Sonne oder im hellen Luft war sie dann blau. Dann habe ich wieder einen Brown Cup, dann habe ich einen Lille Cup, aber meine Haare wollten irgendwie Kalilla. Deshalb habe ich ausgeschaut wie so Milka-Cour, so Brown Lille, Brown Lille, so Flecken halt. Dann habe ich sie mal wieder Brown Cup, dann habe ich sie ganz kurz blond, na, Rot Cup, dann habe ich sie wieder Blaschweiz Cup. Dann habe ich angefangen, einen Blond zu föhnen, war ich fast Platinblond, aber dann habe ich sie auch Gold, Rohrkart und jetzt schaut es mal an. Ich habe die meisten Zeit Extensions drin. Aber das sind bei meiner Mama. Da fahre ich morgen erst hin. Und ja, dann sind sie jetzt so lang. Ich glaube, ich habe sie eh in ein paar Videos schon mal drin gehabt. Also blonden. Die sind so die Haragletten, mit dem Hinterschutz davor. Und so von Paläas so. Das ist super, dass du ihn während der Föhnung fällst. Dann kriegst du total sanfte Haare und das riecht nach Vanille. Ja, es gibt sonst noch über meine Haare. Ich muss wieder mal zur Friseur und ich muss sie gelackten. Ich hasse meine Haare. Ich verbrülle ihn immer so. Ich habe immer die Kommentare bis lang. Ich mache viele Likes und soll jetzt wieder ein paar Videos machen. Das mache ich jetzt auch. Aber ich gehe mit, wo ich wieder arbeiten muss und ich muss schauen, ob ich Zeit habe. Ich mache es jetzt einfach mal, wo wir werden machen. Und sie muss jetzt mal meinen Freund überreden, dass sie mit mir so ein Boyfriend Video macht. Wenn ihr mir ein paar Videos macht auf Instagram, dann kann ich verfolgen. Ein Ambrie. Ja, einfach nur Ambrie. Ja, es wäre voll cool, wenn es verfolgt. Wenn ihr mich abonnieren tut. Wenn ihr das Video gefällt, Wenn es noch ein paar Ideen hat, was ihr wieder für Videos machen sollt, dann wieder eine Kommentare. Wenn es euch nicht gefällt, disliken und dann alle Hater, die es selbst mir gar. Es kann schreiben, so viel es will, die wird auch haben. Es macht mir Spaß, ein paar Videos zu machen. Und ja. Sonst auf Facebook halt auch abonnieren. Celine Embragedout. Und ja, ich wünsche euch noch einen schönen Abend. Bis die.","Hello my dears! When I do an update video about my hair I start from the beginning. I was in Italy on vacation with my friends and my family. It was really cool. I was with my neighbor Riminie and then with Nano. Everything new, I just got the new one. It's the best friend of my sister. I'm going to go back. I have my hair tied up. Oh my god. I will immediately get it. But I also wanted to be my hair in nature. Very cool. What else did I do? I did 8 more. And now I have almost 5 more. Because I will do it tomorrow or maybe today. Very cool. In Italy, the cost is only 3-4 euros and for us 15 or more. I got it from my friend Almantel. We are now 3 months together. And yes, what do you have over my hair? How do you have my hair now? I have natural curls, I have a bun, but they are not so pretty. I have really really really really pretty curls. I really like it when I do it in the city. I have brown hair, I think it's a bit... I have every hair from 12 short-term birthdays. I had blue hair first, then I had a complete blue hair, but I didn't look like a black person. But in the sun or in the sky, I have blue hair. I have a fire again, I have a purple cap, but my hair was a little bit curly. So I chose a milky color, brown, purple, purple, and so on. Then I have a fire again, then I have a red cap, then a purple cap, then I have a blonde for a white, almost platinum blonde. Then I have a gold color card in the chart and I have a blue card. I usually have extensions but they are for my mom. I will do that tomorrow. And yes, they are long. I think I have them in a few videos. I have them in my hair. With the back cover and the baler. It's really good but it's broken. It's a very professional ballet. It's great that you can feel it. You get a whole hair and it's like vanilla. There's nothing new about my hair. I have to go to the hairdresser again and I have to get dressed. I hate my hair. I always get a little bit of a perm. I have a lot of likes and should make a few videos again. I will do that now. But I will work with you again and I have to see if I have time. I will just try to do it. And now I have to talk to my friend that I make a video with my boyfriend. I have made a few videos on Instagram. You can follow me on Instagram. It would be cool if you follow me. Subscribe to my channel. If you like the video, like it. If you have any ideas what to do for the video, leave them in the comments. If you don't like it, dislike it. And then everyone knows that it's set my car. You can write as much as you want. It's fun to make some videos. And yes. Also subscribe to Facebook. Celine Embrace out. And yes, I wish you a nice evening. Bye!"

DVD available to buy now at http://www.theclydebankblitz.co.uk/  Also, please visit http://www.post-blitzclydebank.co.uk/  The Clydebank Blitz: Interview with author, John MacLeod (Part 2 of 2)  A film of short films, featuring nine children and teenagers, who lived in Clydebank, Old Kilpatrick and Dumbarton, at the time of the Clydebank Blitz of 13 and 14 March 1941.  Director of Post-Blitz Clydebank and The Clydebank Blitz: Beneath The Embers, Iain McGuinness, talks to John MacLeod, a journalist for the Scottish Daily Mail, and the author of a new book, River of Fire: The Clydebank Blitz.  The interview was recorded on the site of the former 'Holy City,' in Clydebank, which was heavily bombed on 13 and 14 March 1941.  John speaks about growing up in nearby Scotstounhill, in the 1970s, in a house that still bore the scars of bomb damage; his motivation to write the book; the impact of censorship, from WWII, up until the present day (and the resulting national lack of awareness of the Clydebank Blitz); and his thoughts on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary, in March 2011.  (A wee update; my overzealous editing has led to a factual error, where I ask: ""Earlier that day, you gave a talk at Clydebank Library.

I'm here with John McLeod, the author of a new book, River of Fire, the Caeban Blitz. Thanks for talking to me today John. It's great to be here, but a very soft spot for a glider back. You're a journalist for the Scottish Daily Mail and now an author on local history. Could you talk about your career to date? Well I became a journalist by a kind of awful accident on a left university in 1988. I had a degree in mental philosophy at Edinburgh and then realised I had many job-conferences with philosophers. And I thought to becoming a minister, even a politician. I've been trapped in a web of journalism ever since. I've written for the Scotsman, the Herald, and another Daily Mail. Rural of fire is my secret book. Yes, in fact, that house was damaged by one of the very first bombs that fell that night on 13 March 1941. My damage of features ministered. The Church was in part to cause a high-ranking congregation, which is why I managed to get a job. The man's was at the edge of Scottsdon Jordan Hill, very near the Scottsdon Hill railway station, right beside Queen Victoria Drive. Quite early in the raid at 9 o'clock, a parachute mine fell on Queen Victoria Drive, very near the railway bridge, and detonated it in the middle of the road. And what was it like going up in Scottsdon Hill? difficult time British history. There was constant economic crisis, governments admired incompetence and hopelessness and everything was bleak. Public services were grotesque, there were constant strikes. Everyone was short of money and we ate very drab food. We lived in quite chilly homes. I mean my dad was a minister but in a nice mansion, a nice house, a palace by I suppose by back standards. When we woke up in the mornys of winter to frost on the inside of a bedroom windows, we focused on the central heating in those days. And it was a more austere life. When I went to Scotland school, my for school in April 1971. The Second World War was actually closer to us then than the Falklands War is to us now. And another aspect of that time was of course so many people still young, adaptive and employed had fought in the war, observed in the war. I was taught by teachers who had served in the war. One of our French teachers had been with the Special Operations Executive who'd been captured and taught in Tripoli, Gestapo. Everyone over 35 would remember it. And because everyone could remember it, everyone was very anxious to forget it. And there's a thing they don't want to talk about and discuss. And as a wee boy we ask questions One of the bombing of what happened here everyone was stiff and intense. I think no one talked about that it would not go there. It's interesting in recent years we're starting to see much more interest in the war of younger people. I think a big part of that is to broadcast things. One is the film Saving Private Ryan. The first truly realistic second world war film followed very rapidly the band of brother Sirius. We begin a very distorted sense of the war by a lot of Hollywood garbage pumped out over the decades. People at John Wayne and Edel Flynn starting a film What was your motivation to write the book? the McPhail's book, The Clive Bank Billids, is an remarkable little volume. Although so small, it's way behind the 114 pages is packed with information written with indeniable precision and accuracy. I haven't found a single mistake in McPhail's book, but it was written a long time ago in 1974. He himself was involved in those events using the ARP ward on Dutton-Den Broughton that night, emotionally part of it. And that was always seemed unambiguous. There's a gay discipline and a decision with The Clive Bank Billids, but it's also holding back. to reprints. government decision to pose a new blackout. There was censorship at every level. There were some news deal footage taken, the camera closed, but the government for Barrett to be screened. The paper showed reporters but in very very restricted terms, four-inch columns, referring to a German attack on a town in western Scotland. They couldn't, in a single news report, name the town. There's a famous photograph of the mass burial at Arnotta Cemetery. A terrible scene where the Scottish Secretary and high officials of a mass grave so big it was holding nighty bodies, a big trench, but the photograph is The London Blitz is celebrated as the Attack on Coventry celebrated. That's a big part of England's middle of the war. A burden could take it. So the assessment films about the plucky Londoners and Winston Church went regularly to bombings, places and streets. The King and Queen went regularly to blood sites. None of that happened at Leibach. For quite dark political reasons. Gator Glasgow generally was a very politicised place. It was a place full of strong men and a strong woman. A very anchored and better world for the observes of other children. It was a place of very strong women. organised, intelligent trade unionism. There was a place of very strong Labour Party support and there was a place also very strong communist movement at that time. And there was an unfortunate folk myth in Whitehall of quite serious labour trouble on the Clyde during the First War. Trade unionists and striking workers had, from their perspective, hampered the war effort. So I think a big reason for the Clyde Banco had been suppressed in Newsterm was basically the belief in London, that this was a bunch of commies. And unfortunately Clyde Banks had felt like Clyde Side. And I think for that simple reason of language, people of England and the wider country have an almost difficulty facing the Clydebank as a place. A lot of people talk Clyde sides when they mean Clydebank."

Domingo de manhã venceu Foz e Guaçu por 2 a 1 e a tarde fechou a competição, vencendo São Miguel do Guaçu também por 2 sets a 1. Até agora uma campanha impecável do time comandado pelo professor Fábio Saouen. assim, eles foram equilibrados, todos com tie-break, entendeu? Então mostra que o equilíbrio é muito grande. Nós tivemos, talvez, um pouco, um pouquinho mais de compromisso e conseguimos ganhar os jogos. Mas os jogos foram muito competitivos. A próxima etapa acontecerá em São Miguel do Iguaçu. As cinco equipes que participam da Copa Oeste têm como objetivo principal a fase final dos jogos da juventude. Para chegar lá, no entanto, o cascavel deverá buscar antes a classificação na fase regional. Com as eleições deste ano, o calendário ficou apertado e as competições acontecem sempre em datas próximas, o que preocupa os técnicos que buscam a melhor forma para recuperar os atletas. Os atletas sentem, sentem muito, tanto é que nós temos que fazer um trabalho com eles de recuperação acelerado, porque ao mesmo tempo que a gente saiu de uma competição, a gente tem que fazer o trabalho de recuperação e já organizar eles e preparar eles para a próxima competição, que é curta, é um prazo de 15 dias. nós temos todo um trabalho, temos que acelerar todo o processo.","There were five games and five victories in the team, which led Copa S to victory. On Friday, the victory was 2-0 against Francisco Beltrão. Saturday morning, the team made 2-0 in their blue and afternoon, winning the Toledo by 2-1. Sunday morning, the team won Foz e Goaço by 2-1 and afternoon, closing the competition, winning São Miguel do Iguaçu also by 2-7-1. Until now, it's an impeccable campaign of the team, led by Professor Fábio Saoín. They were balanced, all with tie-break, so it shows that the balance is very big. We had a little more commitment and we managed to win the games, but the games were very competitive. The next stage will take place in São Miguel do Iguaçu. The five teams that participate in the Copa Oeste have the main goal, the final phase of the youth games. To get there, however, Cascavel will have to find before the classification in the regional phase. With the elections this year, the calendar has been tight and competitions always take place in close dates, which worries the technicians who seek the best way to recover the athletes. Athletes feel it, they feel it a lot, so much so that we have to do a work with them, with accelerated recovery, because at the same time that we left a competition, we have to do a recovery work and already organize them and prepare them for the next competition, which is short, it's a 15-day deadline, right? We have to work hard and accelerate the process."
