We had Spider-Man 3, Shrek 3, Halo 3, Pirates 3, PlayStation Crap, Paper Mario 3, and annoying attention dependent baby killing hookers times 3. And now, Activision and Red Octane have fallen to the trilogy bandwagon craze with their latest hype-up, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock. thinking, of course I'm gonna buy it, Guitar Hero can do no wrong. Well what if you've already got Guitar Hero 1, 2, Rocks the 80s and are saving up 170 bucks to buy Rock Band? Should you really spend those 90 greenbacks on this game? To start off, the graphics are amazing! The stage is crazy epic, the crowd is huge and diverse and the characters are incredible, although the lead singer has a freaking ginormous mouth. Still, it's a major step up from Guitar Hero 2. Of course, does all this really matter? when the only thing you're going to be watching are the fret keys coming down the screen? The only graphical thing weird about this game is the star power meter. It's no longer a meter, but a bunch of light bulbs. Even if you're the neighborhood guitar hero champ, the first word out of your mouth when you look at those bulbs on the Rocco meter is going to be, huh? And if you thought it was hard teaching newcomers how star power works, it's going to be nearly impossible now. There's another slight change to the star power that you might not notice at first. In the other guitar hero games, whenever you deployed your star power, the screen shook like crazy. Until you got used to it, this would sometimes screw up your perfect score. In Guitar Hero 3 however, Star Power Deployment is as smooth as ice on a winter's night. No surprise jerks for you. Like the older Guitar Heroes, this version has career, co-op, face-off, and pro-face-off modes. However, there's a new addition to the multiplayer mayhem. Battle. Here, there's no such thing as useless scoring and gutless star power. your drive for victory as you use your fish as guitar hero powers of bloodlust to rip and tear your opponent apart string by string. Seriously, you can rip strings off their guitar. You can also take part in battles in career mode as well when you're in a boss fight. You will battle against legends like Tom Morella and Slash, and when you beat them, you can play as them. Awesomeness. After you beat bosses, you advance the storyline through the most random and hard to follow cutscenes in history. Also, Guitar Hero 3 has online play, something previous versions lacked. I actually prefer this guitar to the new one because with the Guitar Hero 3 controller they try to make it so smooth that it's hard to tell whether you're playing sometimes. And this one's not as smooth. And I can relate to that because I'm a white dude with no rhythm. controller is an awesome deal. They go alone for twice that much on eBay, and besides, this time the controller is wireless, so less cords to get in the way. Also, another little gadget on the new controller, the neck can be taken off for easy storing. But does this mean you should buy the game, or should you save your money for Rock Band? Well here's something to think about. If you're buying Guitar Hero 3 because you've gotten bored with the tracks on 2 and need some new songs, several of the tracks on Guitar Hero 3 are also on Rock Band. This includes Cherub Rock by The Smashing pumpkins, Mississippi Queen by Mountain, and Sabotage by the Beastie Boys. Just something to think about. Anyway, even if you've got all the other versions of Guitar Hero, number three is a must-have.

If you don't mind, we'll just give an ace election and go take our seat, great guys. So we're going to offer this election, let Jesus fix it for you. You see, he knows just what to do. And I've learned a long time ago that when you have one, you're brave. Like this."

Het centrum houdt voortaan maandelijks een speciaal spreekuur waarbij ook een advocatenkantoor uit Zwolle is betrokken. Het CJG kreeg veel vragen van ouders en grootouders die gerelateerd waren aan echtscheidingen die moeizaam verlopen. Ook blijkt dat kinderen langer dan gedacht last houden van de gevolgen van een scheiding. Advocatenkantoor Dommerholt kent deze problematiek ook vanuit de praktijk en besloot om mee te werken aan het spreekuur.,"3001, Echtscheiding",28,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/-W8jc--O9dE.mp3,"Het gaat dan vooral om de zogenoemde vechtscheidingen waar het centrum op dood. En er is behoefte aan een spreekeur. Ja, dat is nodig. Want we hebben eigenlijk de laatste jaren merkken dat er heel veel vragen zijn... ...die gerelateerd zijn aan echtscheidingen. Dus wij dachten met elkaar, wij willen aan die voorkant wat doen. van informatie voorzien uitleggen hoe het in zijn werk gaat maar ook uitleggen wat het doet met je kinderen als je uit elkaar gaat Centrum Jeugd en Gezins Zwolle kiest bewust voor de samenwerking met een advocaatekantoor. Ook de advocaaten zien bijna dagelijks de gevolgen van een moeizamescheiding. Het is misschien wat vreemd om meteen een advocaat bij het sprekenuur te hebben, maar de betrokken partijen zien dat anders. Als we het met mediation doen, straal je uits dat je altijd in gesprek blijft. En dat is voor een kind veel beter.","Children have trouble when their parents leave. That has made us say we have to do something about it. It's mainly about the so-called fighting separations that the centre is aimed at. And there is need for a speech. Yes, that is necessary. Because we have noticed in recent years that there are many questions that are related to real separations. So we thought to each other, we want to do something on the front. ...to explain how it works in their work and what it does to your children when you go out. Zoller, a youth and family centre, is aware of the cooperation with an advocate office. The advocates also see the consequences of a difficult separation almost daily. The example from the practice that we see youth and family are going against each other. We share the importance of information. It's strange to have an advocate at a meeting, but the parties see that differently. It was a choice because we wanted to give information in-house, but also to look at how you can do that in a early project with parents. So, to see what the cost is, but also to see how you can do that in a early project with parents. If you do it with mediation, you always shine out that you are always in conversation. And that is much better for a child."

Vamos conversar com esta comerciante. Dos últimos fatos aí de furtos e assaltos aqui no bairro, como que está a situação hoje? Melhorou? Deu uma amenizada? Como que está a situação agora? No período noturno, eu tenho notado que parece que diminuiu. Pelo menos nós não... Mas, o fato é que você ficou sabendo o que aconteceu aqui na região do bairro Boa Vista. Até sua sócia também teve o carro assaltado em pleno nos do dia, então? Sim, a minha sócia perdeu o veículo dela, também foi furtado. Levou daqui da rua mesmo também. Porque ela estava trabalhando, é o momento que ela foi sair na rua para ir até o carro, não estava mais lá no local. Exatamente. Estáciona o carro e dentro da margem de 15 minutos que entra dentro da loja para ver alguma coisa, quando retorna para pegar o carro, não tem... Já levaram o veículo. Isso um prejuízo a mais para o comerciante então? as reuniões do consegue que teve aqui no bairro em outras regiões também vocês só só chegaram aí tiveram alguma posição que eles passaram mesmo com a reunião pelo gente então tá tendo muita melhora a gente vai né os amigos também vão eles falam então a gente está guardando porque acredita também que não seja tão rápido né mas aos poucos eles falam que vão melhorar então a gente está guardando estamos confiantes que com o passar do tempo né vai melhorar Em relação aos moradores de rua, andarelhos que tinham bastante aqui na região, aqui no bairro. Isso deu uma amenizada, como está a situação? Alguns até rondavam aqui a área região, né? Em questão a isso não melhorou nada. A gente vê todo dia andarelhos. Bastante mesmo. Além da circulação deles, eles entram nas lojas também para pedir. Eu não entrego nada, não dou. Ajuda. Se a gente ficar dando, mas ainda que eles vão ficar por aqui mesmo. Mas não amenizou não. Então aí, dormem na praça da igreja e que eu sei ficam aí. Eles ficam rondando com mais e o que eles pedem então pra vocês? No caso é gorgeo, aí, eles pedem um trocadinho. Eles só assim, tem um trocadinho. Querem um trocadinho. E com isso, então, nos últimos meses, a Sora não viu o policiamento durante o dia. A noite até deu uma amenizada, mas durante o dia ainda permanece. Então, a noite amenizou assim. Eu não sei se os guardas estão passando, isso eu não sei. Eu só sei que a onda de furtos que os nossos amigos comerciantes reclamavam, não vi mais ninguém reclamar. Na minha loja mesmo, pra sempre, quase toda semana, meu alarme diz, mas vai mesmo, já que agora estabilizou. Mas eu acredito que talvez eles tenham... Eles saem, né? Eu acredito que eles migram de um bairro pra outro. Enquanto a quita tá tranquila, Provavelmente as vezes outro bairro pode ser que está sendo mais abordado à noite, né? As lojas.

O que é isso?","The situation in the Buavista neighborhood did not improve after the meetings that were made with the Consegue involving the Guard, involving the military police. The assaults continue in the commercial establishments. Let's go to the Buavista neighborhood to know how the situation is at the moment. And you participate in the 340410 and join a sound box that is the prize of today's program. See me on the fact. The situation of the flood wave that happened here in the neighborhood is good. And also of the unions carried out by the central council. Even with these meetings, it seems that the security in the place has not yet improved. We will talk to the merchants and see how this situation is here in the neighborhood. Let's talk to this merchant. About the last facts of the flood and the assaults here in the neighborhood. How is the situation today? Has it improved? Has it been amenized? How is the situation now? In the night time, I have noticed that it seems to have decreased. At least we are not We didn't see the friends complaining during the night. But on the day of the urn some facts happened in the last 20 days that the friends reported on the street, the merchants. What facts did you know that happened here in the neighborhood of Boa Vista? A friend of ours who has the American store Saados was approached inside the store and was forced. Our colleague from the street, from the clock, was also injured. Even your partner was also injured in the car in the middle of the day. Yes, my partner lost her vehicle. She was also injured. She took me from the street. She was working, it was the time she went out on the street. And the car was not going to the place anymore. Exactly. She parked the car, within the margin of 15 minutes, she goes inside the store to see something. When she returns to get the car, and take the vehicle. And in front of this situation, we realize that you reinforced the security with which we even have a grudge, you put it at the entrance of the door, to try to ammine these problems. Yes, it was. As I reported, the other time I came to report, I was going... It's what everyone is doing here on the street, right? Trying to prevent ourselves, because the security, we haven't seen the police, I don't have a clue. So we try to be careful. We try to put on the stands, reinforce the alarm, reinforce the lock, to try to... This is a more harmful to the merchant. Yes, it causes harm. The expenses, the fear, we are safe, so we try to be careful. The last meetings of the Consegue that was here in the neighborhood, in other regions too, you just arrived there, they had some position, what did they go through? Even with the meeting, for us, it's not so much improving. We go, the friends also go, they talk, so we're waiting, because I also believe that it's not so fast, but little by little they say they will improve, so we're waiting, we're trusting that with the passage of time it will improve. Regarding the street residents, the Andarilhos that had a lot here in the neighborhood, this has been amenized, how is the situation? Some even rounded up the area. In question, this has not improved anything. We see every day Andarilhos. A lot really. In addition to their circulation, they also enter the stores to ask. I do not deliver anything, I do not give. Help. If we keep giving, they will stay here. But they don't amenize. They sleep in the church square and I know they stay there. What do they ask for in the mall? In the case of Gordjeta, they ask for a change. They just say, there is a change. They want a change. And with that, in the last few months, you haven't seen the police for the night. The night has been amenized, but it remains. So, the night amenized? I don't know if the guards are passing by. I just know that the wave of crowds that our commercial friends complained about, I didn't hear anyone complain about it. In my store, almost every week, my alarm goes off, but it goes on, since it stabilized now. But I believe that maybe they have... They leave, right? I believe they migrate from one neighborhood to another. The other neighborhood may be being more crowded at night. I still lack security here. I believe so. Not only that. All neighborhoods need it. Reunions being carried out, the concern of the residents with this issue of lack of security. 6 in the afternoon, 36 minutes. Who's on the phone? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Francisco, where do you come from? I'm from Vila Queiroz. Vila Queiroz, thanks for your call. We're hearing about the situation in Boa Vista, the trade, what do you say about the situation in Vila Queiroz? It's a bit strange, but I've heard about it. Now it's hard for the merchant to work with the trade. It's a risk and imminent assault. You're working on the balcony and at any time someone can come and put a gun in your head and it's complicated to work like this. In any case, he has to be disciplined and I will press him and the bandit. The scaredy cat. Thank you for your call from Villa Queiroz. You are also competing in our draw and in today's show. Thank you for your call and competing in this box that we are going to draw. I'm going to show you the video."

Современный автомобиль не мыслям без системы электроснабжения, которая необходима для питания всех электрических и электронных систем автомобиля, а также для питания дополнительных аксессуарных систем. Сколько электроэнергий потребляют современные автомобили лада? При стандартной эксплуатации инжекторные автомобили потребляют в среднем около 80 ампер, карбюраторные около 68 ампер. изначения даже немного превышают мощность штатного генератора автомобилей Lada. 80 А для инжекторных автомобилей и 55 А для карбюраторных. Но достигаются только при движении автомобиля и оборотах двигателя 1500-2000 оборотов в минуту. В пробке оборотах штатные генераторы могут обеспечивать максимум 50 А. Таким образом, если вы стоите в пробке, то штатный генератор не заряжает аккумулятор, а и два справляется со снабжением электропотребителей, а не достойчиво и Вольт имеет мощность на 50% больше, чем штатные генераторы, которые достигаются уже при холостых оборотах двигателя 600-800 оборотов в минуту. Вы можете подключать любое количество потребителей, которые облегчат вам жизнь, а аккумулятор будет получать необходимый заряд. Как же достигаются такие впечатляющие показатели генераторов Старт Вольт? Генераторы Старт Вольт представляют новое поколение генераторов, использующих фундаментальные законы физики, которые ранее не использовались в таком сочетании. Результатом этого стало появление генераторов повышенной мощности, причем на 50-100% относительно генераторов других производителей при тех же габаритах и весе. При разработке генераторов StartVolt был использован закон сложения 1 и 3 гармоник фазного напряжения. Для этого потребовался вывод от соединения 3-х обмоток статора, то есть от нулевой точки обмоток фаз. Этот вывод присоединен к 2-м дополнительным диодам, которое вы только напряжение третьей гармоники фазного напряжения. В результате ранее неиспользуемая мощность дает прибавку 25-30% к основной мощности. Использование более мощного регулятора напряжения и изменение количества витков обмотки возбуждения ротора увеличило магнитное поле обмотки возбуждения. Кроме того, изменена геометрия полюсной системы ротора. В результате изменилась скорость изменения магнитного потока через статор. Изменен зазор между ротором и статором. эти меры дают еще 25-70% прибавки мощности. Приимущество конструкции генераторов старт-вольт не только в повышенной мощности, но и в улучшенном качестве и долговечности. Например, выводы обмотки статора соединяются с лепестками диодного моста путем первоначального обжима, с последующей пайкой высокотемпературным и стойким кислотом и щелочам припоем. Окончательно соединение покрывается кремния органическим лаком. Это устраняет всяческие переходные контентки. такты с последующим окислением. Обмотка возбуждения ротора и обмотка статора после намотки подвергаются двойной вакуумной пропиткой специальным бакелитовым лаком, защищающим от атмосферных воздействий. Своя особенностью конструкции коллектора ротора. Коллектор жестко зафиксирован в пазах вала, что исключает вероятность поворота такосъемных колец вокруг оси и обрыв провода обмотки возбуждения. В подшипниках генераторов применена специальная антифрикционная смазка, которая не высыхает и не не выплавляется в широком диапазоне температур от минус 60 до плюс 180 градусов по Цельсию. В передних и задних крышках генераторов старт-вольт усилены места под подшипники. Обойма заднего подшипника выполнена из термостойкой пластмассы POLIA MID-66, имеющего температуру размягчения 250 градусов Цельсия. У других производителей это обойма выполнена из обычного полистирола, у которого температура размягчения намного ниже. позволили защитить генераторы StartVolt от так называемого человеческого фактора при сборке и от атмосферных воздействий. Комплекс выше перечисленных конструкторских и технологических решений позволил увеличить срок службы генератора без ремонта до 10 лет. Но главное и уникальное преимущество генераторов StartVolt – превосходство в мощности перед аналогами. 50-процентное преимущество генераторов StartVolt – 80 ампер карбюраторные генераторы и 120 ампер инжектора позволит вам забыть про все проблемы, связанные с энерго дефицитом. А это значит стабильная работа системы зажигания, возможность использования дополнительных потребителей, полностью заряженный аккумулятор, уверенный пуск в морозную погоду. Генераторы StartVolt. Самое мощное, самое надежное генераторы на российском рынке.","This film will be useful to the owners of the Lada car. The modern car is not thoughtless without an electric supply system, which is necessary for powering all electric and electronic systems of the car, as well as for powering additional accessories systems. How much electricity do modern cars use Lada? With standard operation, the injector car consumes about 80 A, the carburetor is about 68 A. Even the power of the original generator of the car and the Lada is slightly higher. 80A for injectors and 55A for carburetors. But only when moving the car and the engine speed is 1500-2000 rpm. The original generators can provide maximum 50A in the power supply. Thus, if you are in the power supply, the original generator does not charge the battery, and the I2 is able to cope with the supply of electric consumers. The current energy is sucked out of the battery. The generator gets water, dust, oil, salt, and road, and inevitable vibrations. All this leads to loss of power. The problem is even more exacerbated by winter, when the fully charged battery is so important. Not getting full charge, the battery battery no longer cope with its main task, the release of the cold engine. That's why your generator must have a power supply. The power of the start volt is 50% more than the original generators, which are already achieved at the idle speed of the engine 600-800 rpm. You can connect any number of consumers that will make your life easier, and the battery will receive the necessary charge. How do these impressive indicators of the start volt generators come to light? The start volt generators represent a new generation of generators using fundamental laws of physics, which have previously been used the The voltage is only controlled by the third harmonic phase voltage. As a result, the previously unusable power increases the 25-30% of the main power. The use of a more powerful voltage regulator and the change in the number of turns of the rotor's winding caused the magnetic field of winding. In addition, the rotor's winding system has been changed. As a result, the speed of the magnetic current change through the stator has changed. The gap between the rotor and the stator has changed. These measures give another 25-70% increase in power. The advantage of the generator's construction in start-volt is not only in increased power, but also in improved quality and longevity. For example, the conclusions of the stator winding are connected with the petals of the diode bridge by the initial clamp, with the subsequent soldering iron and high-temperature and resistant acid and silage. Finally, the connection is covered by the cremation of the organic lacquer. This eliminates all the transverse components. The motor is powered by a double vacuum-fueled pump with a special liquid varnish, which protects from atmospheric effects. The rotor collector is a special construction feature. The collector is firmly fixed in the shaft pads, which excludes the probability of turning the camshafts around the axis and breaking the motor. Special anti-friction grease is used in the bearings of the generators, which does not dry and does not cause any damage. The temperature is not melted in a wide range from minus 60 to plus 180 degrees Celsius. In the front and rear tires of the start volt generators, the places under the bearings are strengthened. The rear bearing is made of thermal-resistant plastic polyamide 66, which has a temperature of 250 degrees Celsius. Other manufacturers have both made of ordinary polystyrene, with a temperature of much lower. The power of the generator was allowed to protect the generators from the start-volt, and the so-called human factor in assembly and atmospheric effects. The complex of higher-ranking design and technological solutions allowed to increase the service of the generator without repair up to 10 years. But the main and unique advantage of the generator start-volt is the superiority in power over analogs. 50% of the advantage of the generator start-volt is 80 ampere carburetor generators and 120 ampere injectors. will allow you to forget about all the problems related to energy deficit. And this means stable operation of the heating system, the ability to use additional consumers, fully charged battery, a confident launch in frosty weather. The generators are StarVolt. The most powerful, the most reliable generators on the Russian market."

Debido al incumplimiento por parte del gobierno provincial continúa la toma del colegio.,,46,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/0jzh-Ytnnhs.mp3,"Bueno, a ver, vamos por parte. Estamos acá en la puerta de la escuela porque existía el compromiso de que hoy venía la empresa para darle continuidad a lo que ya se ha venido haciendo en días anteriores, pero de alguna manera para poder empezar concretamente la obra. En ese sentido se acaba de ir la ingeniera de la empresa, se acaba de ir el gasista de la empresa que estuvieron recorriendo en forma integral la escuela porque el plano de la escuela que le acercamos es viejo y faltaban algunas mediciones, incluso por lo que me dijo la ingeniera faltaban agregar algunas aulas y algunas dependencias de la escuela para cales facciones. Lo que significa que de alguna manera estamos en marcha. También me dijo que en un cálculo estimativo más o menos de 30 días la hora podía estar terminada. A partir de allí, bueno, tenemos que actuar con paciencia, entender que no es una situación fácil y que estoy absolutamente convencido que en la medida que los padres vayan viendo, que se va cumpliendo esto de iniciar la tarea concretamente, bueno, van a ir pudiendo comprobar con sus propios ojos de que esto está en marcha, de que la empresa está contratada, están llegando los materiales en los próximos días para ya poder trabajar con el tema de la cañería y poder llegar a un final feliz, esperemos que con el comienzo del invierno, esta escuela si Dios quiere pueda contar con el gas de Pelein para poder caldefaccionar a sus chicos. De todas maneras, sí, tomada de la escuela. Sí, sí, este es un dato de la realidad, esta mañana temprano hemos tenido algún diálogo que no ha sido fácil, está como todo muy sensible, me parece que bueno, en esto vamos a tener que tener paciencia, yo no conozco otra vía para solucionar estas cuestiones que no sea por la vida del diálogo. ¿Y qué respuesta tiene para los integrantes mañana voy a estar acá hablando con la directora recorriendo el establecimiento y hablando también con las madres de Lipentra 330 que de alguna manera están involucradas en esta obra de gas porque el gas que se va a instalar en el Fodringan incluye a Lipentra 330 e incluye también al Jardín de Infante del Fodringan. Son tres establecimientos que van a contar si Dios quiere en 30 o 40 días con el gas para que le faccionara a los chicos. presencia alguna en estos lugares cuando ya este reclamo viene de larga data, ¿qué está pasando, Alvent? Yo quiero decir con absoluta claridad, Juan Escudero que es responsable, el delegado de infraestructura, del Ministerio de Infraestructura que forma parte del Gabinete del Sur, hemos venido juntos a la escuela, hace 15 días que estamos viniendo, ha venido con técnicos, ha venido con gente de la empresa, la semana pasada vino la gente de YPF que es la que provee los E.P.L.I.N. que ha estado ocupando este tema y es la que es Juan Escudero precisamente el que se ha encargado de contratar la empresa Tecon.","Well, let's go on the part. We are here at the school gate because there was a commitment that the company came today to give continuity to what has already been done in the previous days, but in some way to be able to start the work specifically. In that sense, the company's engineer has just left, the company's gas-maker has just left, who was traveling in an integral way to the school because the school plan that we approached It's old, and some measurements were missing, even the engineering said that some classes and some school dependences were missing for the FACTIONS. Which means that somehow we're on the move. Also, it was said that in a more or less than 30 days estimated calculation the time could be over. From there, well, we have to act with patience, understand that it's not an easy situation and that I'm absolutely convinced that in the measure that parents are seeing, that this is going to be done, to start the task specifically, they will be able to check with their own eyes that this is going to be done, that the company is hired, that the materials are coming in the next few days to be able to work with the subject of the bakery and to be able to reach a happy ending, we hope that with the start of winter, this school, if God wants, can count on gas to be able to make their kids happy. In any case, take it from the school. Yes, yes. This is a fact of reality. This morning, we had a dialogue that has not been easy. It is very sensitive. I think that we will have to be patient. I do not know another way to solve these issues that are not for the dialogue. What answer does the co-operator have for the members of the tomorrow I will be here talking to the director through the establishment and also talking to the mothers of the Ipentra is 30 that somehow are involved in this work of gas because the gas that is going to be installed in the fodringan includes the Ipentra is 30 and also includes the children's garden of the fodringa are three establishments that will tell if God wants 30 40 days with the gas to cool the boys there is a cabinet in the south in the river quarter what it is called the attention that perhaps at least we have appreciated What is going on? I want to say with absolute clarity that Juan Escudero, who is responsible for the infrastructure delegation of the Ministry of Infrastructure, who is part of the South Cabinet, has come to school together. 15 days ago, we were coming, he came with technicians, he came with people from the company, last week the people from the IPF came, which is the one that Provee, Cepelin, and he knows this. and it is Juan Escudero who has been in charge of hiring the company Tecon"

It is a solid...No, it is liquid....Watch out! It is a gas! There's a fun explosion at the end :)  Learn more about The Quirkles at http://www.quirkles.com  Materials: Ice cubes Small plastic bag with zipper top Antacid tablet  Procedure: Put the ice cube(solid) in the bag and close the top. Rub the bag in the palm of your hand to melt the ice. The ice can be placed in the sunlight or in warm water for faster results. The bag is now filled with water, which is a liquid. Open the bag and place an antacid tablet in the water. Reseal the bag and watch the gas form!  Conclusion: The antacid will dissolve and the bag will expand. When the antacid is placed into the water, carbon dioxide gas is formed. The bag could pop if two or three tablets are placed into the water. Be sure and wear your safety goggles! This is a great activity to demonstrate the states of matter.","quirkles, fun science experiments, science fair project ideas, simple science projects, science, science for children, awesome science experiments, cool science experiments",172623,271,16,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/0rL-DxQwiVI.mp3,"I think we will, absolutely. We just witnessed an example that kids can have fun with anything and clearly you had fun with the duct tape. So we can even make it simpler than that. Today we're going to talk about states of matter, but kids don't like to just read about it in a book. They actually like to do it. So we're going to start with some ice, and I'd like for you to just put your ice in the baggie. And the baggie or the ice is your solid, obviously. Three states of matter that most scientists classify. We have solid liquid and gas. We have plasma, but we don't really talk about that a lot. So we're going to close up your baggie. And what the kids are going to do and have fun with is they're going to see how quickly they can melt this ice. We're not going to be able to do that, but sometimes they'll figure out that they need to put that outside or in a warm place. And obviously the ice is going to become a liquid. And a liquid, the molecules are further apart. They do not take the shape of the container. So I'm going to give you a liquid. So now your ice has become a liquid. And to get our gas, we are going to put, open up your bag just about a quarter of your bag so we can close it real quick. and we are going to put, and I'd suggest you put two for a bigger reaction. We're going to put, this is antacid. Oh I need some of this dealing with Shannon Miller all day. Oh she might need it with you with the duct tape you think. Now put, put your gas in there. Now put it, it might put it over there. You can see that the bag is expanding and the gas is forming. What we have done is we have, oh I think mine's getting ready to pop. I don't think I sealed mine right probably. And the carbon dioxide is being formed in the bag. Now, what the kids really like to do, if you want to take it to an inquiry level, is to see how many tablets you can put in the bag to make it explode. So why don't you try that, Rob? Here, let me give you a little bit more water. Does warm water work better? Warm water does work better. That could be another inquiry lesson, is have the kids use the melted ice. It's going to be cold for your liquid and then test that with your warm water and seal this almost all the way first. How many did you put in there? Four right here. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four.

Now, obviously the kids like the gas part of this lesson the best because they can create. What's the salt for? We have 30 seconds left. Okay, the salt, the kids love to have another example of your solids and liquids. Take your ice. The kids love, and here I'll give you a paper towel. They love to have an ice melting contest. Anytime that you put the word contest in it, you can get away with anything. Well, that's what they are to discover. They can rub it. But after a while, they're going to discover that that's going to get pretty cold. Now we know that salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, but kids don't necessarily know that. Then take the salt and rub it. Oh, okay. Oh, wow. And they love this and the competition is on. It's already almost melted. It is. Yes, because of the salt. And this is a good time of year. because they don't understand why you put salt on the roads. And I thought January would be a good month to talk about this, but today it's going to be sixty-five degrees. Sixty-six degrees. So we may not have to worry about that. So that'd be great.

And I was deeply touched by her story. proper funding for the children. And she goes to her pocket to get money to give her food, medicine and all that. So our system is so backdated that she can probably spend about maybe $500 of her money, which is $500, and then the state gives it to her. This is not what you have to say.

It's a change for the young people, to prepare it for a better future and for the elderly that can retire when they really need it. In different cities in New York there are many complaints and there is a plan to fight it. Well, we have to help first, to find work. When you have more work, more people are going to work, okay? And at the same time, we have to bring the back the past police force, bring them back to where they need to be. We, we have cities that have like 20 police officers. In reality, it should be about 100. You know, they are working overtime and that's what we need to work on with that. I am a person who will work every day and I know how life is out there. I know that paying for the mortgage, taxes, insurance and all that. I understand that I know what it is to work.

Catania con centro Camparombo, Bayocco c'entra avanti a retrato. Qui Paolucci calcia male dopo essere sfuggito a Lopez. Cagliari in difficoltà nei disimpeni e troppo insistente nelle palle alte. Siciliani insidiosi con leggietto balistico mascara. L'unico un po' ispirato fra i sardi e Kossum, acqua fresca e Jedda sono distratti. Così a rischiare. e ancora il portiere di casa Marchetti sul sinistro di Capuano. Sul fronte rosso blu, Jedha non spaventa Bizzarri. Allegri sveglia i suoi nell'intervallo e nella riprese il Calieri è più convinto. Qui Bizzarri è messo in difficoltà da un cross di cossù. Prime sostituzioni, l'Argentino llama per viaggianti e matri per uno spento acqua fresca. E che matri sia in pomeriggio, carico di voglia e tensione agonistica, lo dimostra subito di forza e solo Bayocco sull'invito del compagno tedesco. Ancora un cambio, Lazari percorso fra i rossi blu. E' una cinetta non certo da calcio inglese con l'arbitro impolese Pinsani che si commuove troppo fermando il gioco tra i fischi di molti sulle la mentele di mascara. e gioia dei tifosi Sardi. che non deve scherzare con la classifica. Linea a Franco-Lauro. caliari perché è molto importante al centro aria sul dischietto di rigore c'è un netto rigore di silvestri sul lazari ma è qui evidentemente c'è qualcosa di buono nell'arbitro perché applica la norma del vantaggio e matrisenia quindi bene in questo caso far vedere che qualche volta gli arbri li applicano anche alcune norme in modo corretto","12,000 spectators at the Santelia, a punition of Mascare, a shot from Capuano, out. Catania with the centre of the field, Rombo, Bayocco with the centre of the back, here Paulucci, a bad kick after being run over by Lopez. Caliari in the difficult times and too insistent on the high balls. Sicilians, insidious with the ballistic genius, Mascare. The only one a bit inspired by the Sardis and Cosum, Acqua Fresca and Jeda are distracted. So to risk, and the goalkeeper on the left of Capuano. Red-blue on the front, Jedha not giving up. Bizarro wakes up in the interval and the ball is more convincing. Bizarro is put in trouble by a cross. First substitutions by the Argentine Yama for the Travellers and Matri for a free water break. Matri is in the afternoon, full of desire and agonistic tension, and he shows it immediately. I'd like to thank the fans of Sardinia and the fans of Capuano. because it is very important to have a clear center of air on the disc of the rigor and there is a clear rigor of silvestries on the laser but here obviously there is something good in the orbit because it applies the norm of the advantage and matrixenia so well in this case let us see that some doors to the trees also apply some norms in the correct way"

A vitória espetacular sobre o Boca Júnior não só levou o Fluminense a final, como também escreveu uma página histórica na Libertadores. O fim de um tabu de 45 anos. Homens predestinados em meio a uma tempestade tricolor de 84 mil pessoas. Dizem os idiotas da objetividade que torcida não ganha jogo. Pois ganha! Aponho acompanhado de tensão que virou deslumbramento diante do requinte de Cicel que virou esperança quando Gabriel deixou o Morel Rodrigues para trás só que a bola recebeu um carinho de Washington e decolou sobre o Miore. Uma partida decisiva porém não é feita apenas de beleza e nem o boca é tímid com casa cheia. Dátulou bateu o escanteio e Palermo deu a Fernando Henrique a primeira dose do Veneno Argentino. O tempo Dátulo tentou de novo e Palermo encontrou um único espaço entre Fernando Henrique e a Trávio. Oca insaciável parecia que ia devorar o Fluminense. Se querer saber o futuro do Fluminense, olhar o seu passado. A história tricolor traduz a predestinação para a glória. O passado recente ensinou a torcida que este é um time de vitórias incríveis. e ainda não estava no jogo. E quando Dodô entrou no lugar de Igor, caiu para ajudar o fulminense a se levantar. Foi quando a tensão se transformou em euforia. Porque o Washington foi mais uma vez decisivo e a torcida descobriu que o excelente cabeceador também sabe cobrar falta. Eu que sou acertoravante, sou responsável por tentar resolver as partidas, né? Então eu queria ir no de tudo que é forma. e o do que ele ajudar. Pocou para a conca, revelado no River Plate, para onde rival do Boca, que o cara bola que encontrou na Pede Barra, antes de ir para a rede. Quando nós chegamos ao Buenos Aires, eu falei para a conca. Revela que para os companheiros, se eu tinha um adversário que ele queria vencer, o NUNAR era o BOCA. Com Boca é eliminar o Boca. Dátulo e Palermo não queriam deixar, mas passar por Fernanda e Henrique não tem sido fácil nessa libertadores. Quando a bola de Ledesma passou, encontrou o pé Salvador de Thiago Silva. E é de Cáceres foi parar no travesseo. Eu falo que tem duas palavras que caminham juntos. Pelo menos desde o que eu nasci. Sorte de competência. Competência e talento também. Isso o Fluminense tem a pena torcida. Chico Buarque sofreu. E se empolgou com o velocista Junior César que ganhou de Cáceres já avançou. não deixou que o terceiro gol fosse dele. Estava guardado para Dodô. Ele passou por Cáceres e Batalha para confirmar a classificação e mandar um recado. Eu respeito o cara que manda, ele que escala. Só que eu tenho que pensar que está jogando. Personagens de uma história escritam em capítulos cheios de reviravoltas, todos por enquanto com o mesmo final feliz para a alegria de Chico. A torcida tricolor é a primeira a comemorar a classificação de um time brasileiro sobre o boca na Libertadores desde 63. 12 caíram, mas o Fluminense ficou em pé. Com todo respeito ao Boca, que valorizou muito a nossa vitória, o que eu tenho pra salar é Boca Junho. Muito prazer, Fluminense. Parafraseando o grande drama turgo e tricolor Nelson Rodrigues, daqui a 12. 200 anos, a cidade dirá mordida de nostalgia àquele prominente bocajunas.","A night of gala in Maracanã. The spectacular victory over Boca Juniors not only led Fluminense to the final as well as wrote a historic page in Libertadores. The end of a 45-year taboo. Pre-nourished men in the middle of a triple-tempest of 84 thousand people. They say the idiots of the objectivity that torsida does not win the game. Well, it wins! Support followed by tension, which became a disappointment in front of the Requinte de Cicero, which became hope when Gabriel left Moral Rodriguez behind, but the ball received a little bit of Washington and took off from the top. A decisive game, however, is not made only of beauty, and neither the mouth is timid with a full house. Datulo beat the scanty and Falermo gave Fernando Henrique the first dose of Argentine Veneno. For example, Datolo tried again and Palermo found a unique space between Fernando Henrique and Atrave. Unlucky, it seemed that Fluminense would devour. If you want to know the future of Fluminense, look at your past. The story of Tricolor translates predestination to glory. The recent past taught the crowd that this is a team of incredible victories. and when Dodô entered the place of Igor, he fell to help the Fuminense get up. It was when the tension turned into euphoria, because Washington was once again decisive and the crowd discovered that the excellent head coach also knows how to charge the foul. and he wanted to help. He went to Conca, revealed in the River Plate where Boca's rival, Ficarabola, who found the bar before going to the net. When we arrived at Buenos Aires, I told him to go with the club. Conca reveals that to the teammates, if he had an opponent he wanted to win, the Nunaar was the good one. Conoca is to eliminate Boca. Datulo and Palermo didn't want to leave, but to pass to Fernando Henrique, it has not been easy in these free-ups. When the ball of ledesma passed, he found the savior foot of Thiago Silva. And it's from Cáceres to stop on the journey. I say that there are two words on this path, at least from what I was born. Luck and competition. Competition and talent too. This, Fluminense, has only the twisted leg. Chico Buarque suffered. And if he touched with the fast, Junior César, who won by Cáceres, advanced. But the trap in the first half He didn't let the third goal be his. He was saved for Dodô. He went through Cáceres and Batalha to confirm the classification and send a message. I respect the guy who sends, he who scales. But I have the impression that he is playing. Characters of a story written in full chapters of Reviravoltas. All for now with the same happy ending for the joy of Chico. The Tricolor fans are the first to celebrate the Brazilian team's classification in the Libertadores since 1963. They fell 12, but Fluminense was on the ground. With all due respect, I have a lot of courage and I have to say it's a pleasure. Fluminense. 200 years, the city will die of nostalgia for that imprevence and Bocajunas."

He gives more if you ever want to run for him He gives you 27 laws in exchange for 27 pure essence and you get three 27 noted pure essence, so just a little I hope you enjoyed this video, I'll be doing some slayer which I do a lot, sometimes lore running so I can get lore to get my magic up, I'll be doing clan events that I'll be recording, and hopefully doing a lot of other stuff. Basically the topic for this video is how I started RS. So basically I started RS once practically 16th minute. But excuse me, practically 16th minute I started RS in 2004. So at that time I'd be about 7, 6, 7 so I was pretty young I suppose. So I started it and I was just mesmerised by the game. I mean that's the only game I kind of played at that time, part of mini-clip games and stuff like that. And we all played them mini-clip days. games in them days. So yeah, I think the favourite thing I used to do then was go to Brimhaven when I was a member. I used to go to Brimhaven and I used to do the agility course so much. I used to think it was so much fun even though I literally didn't get any of the tickets in the right time. But I used to think it was fun to see my character doing all them epic dodges. Then eventually I got more membership, got my stats up a little bit. What did I do? Let me try anything I used to do. Oh yeah, I bought Varrock West Bank. I spent so much time there with everyone else trying to telegrab them Ruby Rings because they you thought they self are so much back in the day, but they didn't really that was it that was a kind of a exciting thing and then Years went on by eventually Got my stats up some more stuff like that. Oh, why is he trading me? Why is everyone trading me? Oh, this is annoying. So, I've been actually... membered on RS for a good, like... a good six years, I'd say. Wait, let me think about that. Yeah, a good six years, because I know I've got my five-year veteran cape on my account, so I'm surely must be at least five. Otherwise, I'll have to make up a bug. So, good five years. I should be hopefully, like, approaching my ten-year cape, which would be good to see. I'm trying to get into EOC but I've been spending most of my time on here. I'm still doing some lore running, I really need to get um, I think 66 for the Gorok. It's one of the teleports, I was 668, it's one of the ancient teleports, I need that because I did a lot of infernal mages in the Slayer Tower, so that teleports, instantly teleports to the pub in Canaphe, so it should be really helpful for me. So um, I'll be getting the up over, well I'll be running lore into the next couple of days to try and get them. I think I've already got about 200 in my bank, but I need to get it. quite expensive at the minute. I could run natures but I was pretty good for natures I don't really use them at the minute. I could low elk if I really wanted to but I don't really feel like it. I'll probably elk when I get to 55 magic longs or so as everyone else does. Just to overview of my stats still they're called kind of the same. I might go do some wood cutting at willows for a bit get to 60 so I can cut use down some u-longs. etc. So yeah, I suppose that could be a kind of a video for today. I should... oh, I just clicked my leg. That'll be my video for today. Expect more. So when we get my stats up there should be a progress video coming out soon which it has basically all my levels from when I started playing Projector at this present time. So yeah, that's been Rich Tea. I'm out and bye.","What's up guys? It's a rich tea back here.

I would have actually liked it if it was properly released when it was meant to, so it would actually be a better game. I don't really like the abilities, but I can probably get used to them I suppose. I'm still doing some lore running, I really need to get 66 for the Gorok.

El drama narra la relación entre mujeres blancas en Mississippi y sus criadas negras en la década de los 60.

At first many complained and did not want to do it, but in any case, even in the book about Steve Jobs, They had to fix it and transfer it to electronic form. Today printing is much less than through electronic stores. Before on the 4th firmware, when you downloaded any magazine, it was displayed on the desktop as a program. Now you all downloaded the magazine, they are in the kiosk program. Let's show. Enter the webstore, click search. In my opinion, we do not have many magazines. There is almost no. Interesting, which I would like to read. Most of them use the first webstore. You can find the journal, but you can find the ones you want. For example, we choose the first one. It weighs a lot. Press it for free and set it. And pay attention, it automatically gets into the kiosk program, not on the desktop. It's just in the form of an application. It's the same as loading. It's the same as setting. There will be a lot of them, it will be shelves. It looks not very beautiful. In a similar interface, you will use the iBooks program, which we will consider further. Kiosk collects all your subscriptions for all newspapers and journals, roughly speaking, in one shelf. And a special sticker appears on the program, that a new journal came out. And of course, they automatically download, as soon as you connect to the Wi-Fi network. You can open the journal with a simple hand movement, even a finger. After that, you can watch. new journal to be brought to us so now let's go out again and pay attention to the fact that when the new journal is such a picture, or rather such a new petal, our sixth firmware, by the way, each program will be displayed so new so that we have some oh my god here are some no thanks here and here we have the first one, see, immediately buy here, leave I think that I will not touch it, because I did not find interesting journals for myself.

Yes, well, this is how I did those. Start by melting some butter in a skillet. Mix until smooth and thick. When you see that it's getting golden, flip it over. As you see, the first side of the crepe is always the nicest. So you flip it again before dumping it out on a plate so that when you fold it in half or you roll it, the nicest looking side will be the one visible. Little more batter into the skillet, making sure that you pour it on one side and move the pan as fast as you can so it's spread out and cover the whole base of the pan. You can always add a little more batter if there is any hope. The batter is thin enough. It will form tiny tiny holes all around the edge. What we call dentelles or lace in French. You can fill the crepe with a variety of things like butter and a bit of sugar or jam. I love apricot jam. And you can roll them and start folding them if you prefer. You can add also grated chocolate with a bit of butter and it's delicious. And now we have a whole tray of garnish crepes with a bit of powdered sugar. on top, fresh fruit, some mint leaf, and it should be served warm at room temperature. They are delicious."

Ντοκυμανταίρ 2011 συμπαραγωγής της ΕΡΤ, του Μουσείου του Λούβρου, του Γαλλικού Κέντρου Κινηματογράφου και του τηλεοπτικού καναλιού ΑRTE και παραγωγής της εταιρείας «Les Films du Tambour de Soie». Το σενάριο και τη σκηνοθεσία υπογράφει ο Bernard George.  Alexandre Le Grand ~ Le Macedonien  Με την ευκαιρία της μεγάλης έκθεσης στο Μουσείο του Λούβρου, η ταινία αναδεικνύει μέσα από μία νέα οπτική τα ίχνη του υλικού και καλλιτεχνικού πολιτισμού του βασιλείου του Μεγάλου Αλεξάνδρου. Φωνή και εικονογραφία συμμετέχουν στη φανταστική αναδημιουργία της ιστορίας και του κύριου πρωταγωνιστή της.  Το ντοκιμαντέρ, που παρουσιάζει τη ζωή του Μεγάλου Αλεξάνδρου και τη συμβολή του στη διάδοση του ελληνικού πολιτισμού από τη Μακεδονία μέχρι την Ινδία, προβάλλεται στην έκθεση «Στο βασίλειο του Μεγάλου Αλεξάνδρου - Η Αρχαία Μακεδονία» που θα φιλοξενηθεί από τις 3 Οκτωβρίου 2011, έως τις 3 Ιανουαρίου 2012 στο Μουσείο του Λούβρου.  Η μεγάλη και εντυπωσιακή αυτή έκθεση είναι μια διακρατική πολιτιστική διοργάνωση μεταξύ Ελλάδας και Γαλλίας που έχει ως στόχο την ανάδειξη της πλούσιας πολιτιστικής κληρονομιάς της Ελλάδας και ιδιαίτερα του μακεδονικού πολιτισμού.  Αφετηρία και επίκεντρο της ταινίας είναι η Μακεδονία. Η ταινία προσφέρει ένα ταξίδι στους τόπους που γαλούχησαν τον Αλέξανδρο. Συντηρητές και αρχαιολόγοι μιλούν για την εμβέλεια των ανακαλύψεών τους, αναλύοντας το υλικό και πολιτισμικό περιβάλλον μέσα στο οποίο μεγάλωσε ο Αλέξανδρος: Το τεράστιο ανάκτορο της Πέλλας όπου γεννήθηκε ο Αλέξανδρος. Τα Στάγειρα, γενέτειρα του δασκάλου του, του Αριστοτέλη, ο οποίος δίδαξε την τέχνη της Λογικής και ενίσχυσε την αγάπη του για τον Πολιτισμό. Ο αρχαιολογικός χώρος της Βεργίνας, οι αρχαίες Αιγές, πρώτη πρωτεύουσα του βασιλείου της Μακεδονίας, όπου ήρθε στο φως ο τάφος του βασιλιά Φίλιππου του Β', πατέρα του Μεγάλου Αλεξάνδρου. Το Δίον, μία από τις τρεις πολιτείες όπου έκανε θυσία πριν την εκστρατεία του και διέταξε την κατασκευή ενός μεγαλοπρεπούς ναού αφιερωμένου στον Δία. Τα Λευκάδια με τον θαυμάσιο τάφο των Ανθεμίων, η Αμφίπολις όπου η αρχαιολογική σκαπάνη φέρνει στο φως ένα καινούριο αρχαιολογικό χώρο και τέλος το Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Θεσσαλονίκης που φιλοξενεί μερικά από τα πιο όμορφα «ίχνη» (κοσμήματα, χειροτεχνήματα) της εποχής. Παράλληλα με αυτές τις αφηγήσεις, ακούγεται και η δραματοποιημένη φωνή του ίδιου του Μεγάλου Αλεξάνδρου, όπως τη φαντάστηκε ο συγγραφέας Laurent Gaude - βραβείο Goncourt 2004, στο θεατρικό του έργο, Ο Μπλε Τίγρης του Ευφράτη -, που μας μεταφέρει στα πιο διάσημα επεισόδια του έπους του: τη συνάντηση με τον Βουκεφάλα, τη δολοφονία του πατέρα του, Φίλιππου του Β', τις μάχες στα Γαυγάμηλα και τον Υδάσπη ποταμό και το θάνατό του στη Βαβυλώνα.","Alexandre Le Grand, Grec Macedonien   Le Musee du Louvre  1 4   YouTube",399,2,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/3mfD-MmFcU8.mp3,"Nous voilà ça la présent.

Les rènes de Perce au pied d'Alexandre. Les rènes de Perce au pied d'Alexandre, c'est quoi ? Une fois qu'Alexandre a vaincu Darius, qui devient évidemment le grand trempeur d'Asie, il y a une petite confusion qui s'opère dans l'attente des femmes de la suite impériale.

Là, c'est le début de l'imagerie officielle d'Alexandre à Porta Louis XIV. C'est la place de l'Annaqtore, qui a évoqué des rèdées de la construction de la construction de l'Annaqtore. c'est la maman de l'intervention pour toutes les situations que nous nous observons, n'importe quoi.

In prayer, let's say, what really happened in the myth is not only his high warrior virtue, we agree, the chance he has as an intelligence and physical strength that makes him the great winner, the great hero of the West who just won Asia, but it is also all the traits of his character that make him an exceptional being. The Brains chose a theme, the Queen of Perses, at Alexander's feet. So the Queen of Perses, at Alexander's feet, what is it? Once Alexander had defeated Darius, who became the great emperor of Asia, there is a little confusion that occurs in the attempt of the women of the imperial suite. The emperor is prostrated at the feet of the general who accompanies Alexander, who is the first to be killed. So, she simply makes a mistake of Monarch, even though she was mistaken for Alexander the Great's identity, which is, for a woman to win something dramatic, she deserved a special release. Alexander forgives her. And this act of generosity of Alexander, this act of compassion, which ultimately translates into a great moral character, may be reported to the young Monarch who is 21 years old. This is the beginning of the official image of Alexander in the U14. The Greek-American, even the Napoleon, was trying to build many buildings with Alexander the Great. But if the myth of the living being, here, and 2000 years, through the painting and the art, what do we know about his building and the world he grew up in? Alexander the Great was born in the Kingdom of Macedonia in 356 BC. The capital of the kingdom, which was located in northern Greece, was called Aegis, the modern Virgin. The palace of Philip, in the Aegean, which begins to build the 350th century, that is, with the fact that Philip is a priest in power, 350th BC, and it is, as ever, ready the 336th BC when Philip was a priest. The main point of the building is the large yard, which shows the power of the Baton, not the kings of Macedonia, but the whole of Greece. The building's location was exactly the same as the ruins of the architectural and the elements that were connected with the power. And here, where we are exactly, was the sea of ​​the building. And no one went to a large theater hall, which is the first destination in Greek history. The mother of the family is a very loving and dedicated person. She was born here. She has 60 years of age. Her age is about 2000 years. They separated here to have about 3,500 people. Something more than the whole elite and all the aristocrats of Macedonia. What is this? We say, we say, something like a palace. But the idea is not at all a private house. Here, the private life has not been set. That is, the women of the Philippines, their children, did not live here, did not give birth, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a home, did not have a It's the spirit of the Iquus, the spirit of the Mezons, the spirit of an ungrateful, public building.

Yo no podía ser más feliz. pero esa noche entró azotando puertas y paredes me morí el cajón donde yo estaba y me tomó con todas sus fuerzas oye pero que no se supone que para eso son los calcetines? no lo entenderías tu nunca ha sido calcetín osea quieres decir que tu nunca usas calcetines? nooo como esas mujeres a las que les vuelen las patas bueno eso fue todo por hoy tal vez fue un pequeño video tal vez un poquito corto no nos veremos en la siguiente ocasión me decidí tomar más tiempo para empezar a sacar más vídeos así que esperadlos, no se desanime la adquisición de una nueva mascota puede ser algo excitante, excitante, excitante, excitante, excitante, emocionante pero antes de hacerlo hay algunas cosas que debes considerar si la verdad no estás dispuesto a tener un perro grande en casa y no estás dispuesto a limpiar su caca todos los días a llevarlo a pasear o a darle las dos o tres comidas que tienes que darle diariamente por el resto de su vida o la tuya. Lo único que te puedo recomendar es que no cómples ese animal, pues seguro terminarás mandándolo a la perrera o tirándolo en cualquier lugar de la ciudad y va a terminar en la perrera donde seguramente si deberás de veras de veras de veritas de veritas quieres tener un perro por favor date una vuelta a la perrera aunque que sea algo triste pero adopta un perro de los que esté por ahí salva a un perro de los que está ahí en vez de comprar otro porque solo estás alimentando un negocio de perros que van a terminar cayendo en la perrera pero si la verdad decides que no quieres tanta responsabilidad puedes intentar con varias otras opciones si quieres tener una mascota puedes intentarlo con un tacitin, un huevo, un cargador de celular, una salchicha, un plátano medio plátano, un lapicero, una sandalia, un libro o una raqueta. El real objetivo de esto es que dejemos de comprar perros que tiremos en la calle y que nos hagamos realmente responsables por nuestras acciones. A final de cuentas si no lo hacemos nosotros, ¿quién lo va a hacer? Pero ya basta de regaños, pásensele a Chevere, nos veremos la siguiente semana. Adiós.","Hello, my name is Palles and as always I have to apologize for the delay of making this new video. The truth is that many times I don't realize when I'm in the country. I'm leaving now. I'm leaving to see her. What? Why? There's no time to waste. Give me your cell phone. My cell phone? What? No, why? Oh, you don't remember? What's wrong? You let me wait three hours on the phone. But if I told you... This is your phone. It was an exam! Besides, I just wanted to make money. And if I did? You're doing your vlog, right? Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Well, well... Sometimes I think all my acquaintances know this story. But it's a story that I like to tell a lot, it's like sharing something very mine. And... It's really something I want to share with all of you. In one of my past lives... What? What you are listening to? I was a calcetine in my past lives. Oh, that's right. Shut up! Let me tell you the story. I remember that I was a calcetine. I lived very happy with my twin brother. We lived in a clothing store. One day, a very beautiful lady adopted us. And why do I have to be the lady? Well... I'm sure that the lady would be a very good place for us. But just in the middle of the road, a wind gust blew me up in my brother's arms and decided that I wouldn't come to my adoptive mother's house. My adoptive mother didn't see me and my brother was trying to grab me, watching the cold, and stuff. That's why a very kind person passed by. He took me in his hands and took me home. He bathed me in shampoo, and then he finished a joke and took the drawer. I couldn't be happier. It was wonderful. But that night... You were knocking on doors and walls. You were playing with me. You took me with all your strength. Hey, but what do you mean by that? They're the socks? You wouldn't understand. You've never been a sock. So you mean you've never worn socks? No! Like those women who smell your legs. Well, that was all for today. Maybe it was a short video, maybe a little short. We will see you next time! I decided to take more time to start making more videos, so wait for them! Don't get discouraged! The acquisition of a new pet can be something exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting exciting to take your poop every day, or to give him two or three meals that you have to give daily for the rest of your life or yours. The only thing I can recommend is not to buy that animal. Well, you will surely end up sending it to the dog or throwing it anywhere in the city and it will end up in the dog where surely if you really really really really want to have a dog, please take a look at the dog but adopt a dog from the ones that are around save a dog from the ones that are there instead of buying another one because you are only feeding a dog business that will end up falling into the dog but if you really decide that you don't want so much responsibility you can try with several other options if you want to have a pet you can try it with a catfish, an egg, a cell phone charger, a sausage, a banana a half banana, a napkin, a sandalia, a book or a racket. The real goal of this is that we stop buying dogs that we have on the street and that we are really responsible for our actions. In the end, if we don't do it, who will do it? But that's enough of jokes. Have fun, see you next week. Bye."

The average 11 rebounds went that stretch. Block the lottershots. Okura, up the 3 for 17 now for on the metal Cool. Playoff tomorrow. Oh, gets it. That's a rightful set for a three. Now two point jazzy 625 left in the second quarter points in a row on you It's now got to score going to the basket here That's the fifth on the jazz and the great deal for the free throw is faced up to the basket outside of the paint You can't touch him what the jazz have been doing is they could get enough to trace the great ease space Watch here. There's the arm are right there You're not allowed to do that any touching is supposed to be a foul the fishes have not been calling that this series The first time I've seen you call Of course Tracy struggling from the field. He's only one for six now He misses his first sweet though. It's just one of those games where he's got to get into it and lead his team In the NBA three-point shooting this year he's made only three That's what he needs to do in transition before the defense has said take over 32 31 Williams getting it down to boozer. Explodes to the basket a player like team act you cannot shade in one way or the other He's too good with either hand. That was a great job by team act of recognizing that defense and taking what he could get Not hurting that bad for fishers This is slam dunk who's it with eight points? You taught jazz not only been more aggressive taking the ball to the basket, but they've been more aggressive going after the loose balls I would the post up now they're putting Fisher on McGray. He is found and almost Just keep milking it when it's working keep milking it even in Chuck Hayes makes a cut through the lane give him more room to operate Tracy McGray they cannot stop him on the low especially when he's aggressive like he is at this moment going to the basket. Why would you put a bigger guy on him like Millsap if he's gonna post up? Well, because then he just takes Millsap outside. Exactly. You just keep making moves. Chest moves. Alright, McGrady wants it posting up again. He's got it. He worked on Fisher. Little bump, my Fisher, it didn't stop him. Millsap tackled, yeah I mean. That's up Shane. Extra pass to Austin. Down to McGrady. Hayes yes 27 seconds left in the Rockets are down by three. You see what happens when you get the credit McGready going on the low post he makes his teammates better because he's gonna score but he's gonna create opportunities for guys like Chuck Hayes and Shane Badiate. Get him the ball. Rockets seem like they're playing with a little more urgency now. Gets into about three seconds. Shot clock game clock. Shot clock down to five seconds. William. down to three down to two. Hayes has to shoot it. They've been playing him one-on-one so Collins can't stop him if y'all takes his time Get the shot that he wants great entry passes are important as well. That's the effectiveness for y'all Well, you look at Tracy McGrady. He's four for ten here He is working out on the low block four for ten with 13 points and this is how he did it posting he's aggressive look at him going to the basket creating the foul almost getting the three-point play again Fisher's too small turn jumper nothing but net you got a milk that good y'all and Tracy Great for misses and Yow with a rebound. Missed it. You don't want a finger roll in the paint in the playoffs. Go throw that down. It's a dunk there. Yeah, Terry DeGrabble. I'm gonna give me the open looks like that. Aaron Williams. Jazz have all the answers. 6-0 run by Utah. And the Yow-Mean turns, baseline hit it. All in one motion. He got wide open then, post. He could have walked in for the layup. He didn't know it. They played just over three. Into the third quarter didn't get his feet set. What a great shot by Williams. He's pumped up. That's a kind of praise that gets you the lead in this series. Absolutely, Matt. But if you notice, Yow had the ball coming from his waistline. He's got to get that ball up.","Grady with a double team constantly.

The average 11 rebounds went that stretch. Block the lottershots. Okura, up the 3 for 17 now for on the metal Cool. Playoff tomorrow. Oh, gets it. That's a right for 6 for a 3. Now two point jazzy 625 left in the second quarter points in a row on you It's now got to score going to the basket here That's the fifth on the jazz and the great deal for the free throw is faced up to the basket outside of the paint You can't touch him what the jazz have been doing is they could get enough to trace the great ease space Watch here. There's the arm are right there You're not allowed to do that any touching is supposed to be a foul the fishes have not been calling that this series The first time I've seen you call Of course Tracy struggling from the field is only one for six now. He misses his first sweet though It's just one of those games where he's got to get into it and lead his team In the NBA three-point shooting this year he's made only three That's what he needs to do in transition before the defense has said take over 32 31 Williams getting it down to boozer Explodes to the basket a player like team act you cannot shade in one way or the other He's too good with either hand. That was a great job by team act of recognizing that defense and taking what he could get Not hurting that bad for fishers This is slam dunk who's it with eight points? You taught jazz not only been more aggressive taking the ball to the basket But they've been more aggressive going after the loose balls. I would the post up now that putting Fisher on McGray. He is found and almost Just keep milking it when it's working keep milking it even in Chuck Hayes makes a cut through the lane give him more room to operate Tracy McGray they cannot stop him on the low especially when he's aggressive like he is at this moment going to the basket. Why would you put a bigger guy on him like Millsap if he's gonna post up? Well, because then he just takes Millsap outside. Exactly. You just keep making moves. Chess moves. Alright, McGrady wants it posting up again. He's got it. We'll work on Fisher. He'll bump my Fisher. It didn't stop him. Millsap tackled Yawni. That's up Shane. Extra pass to Austin. Down to McGrady. Hayes yes 27 seconds left in the Rockets are down by three. You see what happens when you get my credit McGready going on the low post he makes his teammates better because he's gonna score but he's gonna create opportunities for guys like Chuck Hayes and Shane Badiate. Get him the ball. Rockets seem like they're playing with a little more urgency now. Gets into about three seconds. Shot clock game clock. Shot clock down to five seconds. William. In and inside for two. Goodness that was easy. Down to three down to two. He's has to shoot it. They've been playing him one-on-one so Collins can't stop him if y'all takes his time Get the shot that he wants great entry passes are important as well. That's the effectiveness for y'all Well, you look at Tracy McGrady. He's four for ten here He is working out on the low block for pretend with 13 points and this is how he did it posting He's aggressive look at him going to the basket creating the foul almost getting the three-point play again Fisher's too small turn jumper nothing but net you got a milk that good y'all and Tracy Great for misses and y'all with a rebound. Missed it. You don't want a finger roll in the paint in the playoffs. Go throw that down. It's a dunk there. Yeah, Terry DeGrabble. I'm gonna give me the open looks like that. Aaron Williams. Jazz have all the answers. 6-0 run by Utah. And the Almey turns baseline. Hit it. All in one motion. He got wide open then, post. He could have walked in for the layup. He didn't know it. They played just over three. Into the third quarter didn't get his feet set. What a great shot by Williams. He's pumped up. That's a kind of praise that gets you the lead in this series. Absolutely, Matt. But if you notice, Yau had the ball coming from his waistline. He's got to get that ball up."

In asthma, the airways are oversensitive and easily irritated by certain triggers called asthmatic triggers. Most people with asthma are described as a topic, meaning they have an allergic type reaction to external triggers, such as house dust mites, pollen, cigarette smoke, animal fur and chest infections. The condition is finding itself more and more relevant for Montreal families, where approximately One in four children will suffer from a breathing related disease such as asthma. Not only are these conditions traumatic for the kids, but they stop them from experiencing their childhood as are plenty of aggressors. Because Montreal is such an urban area, we are facing the issue of air pollution which can in turn aggravate asthma, especially in children. Asthma, especially among children, can be aggravated by external environmental factors that are in the air that we breathe, such as fumes and pollen. These factors can cause pain and even trigger asthma attacks which can be fatal. Studies done have found smoking to be an extremely important factor in aggravating asthma. Explosions to second hand smoke was linked to 10% of pediatric asthma problems and 13% of other respiratory illnesses. So they, yeah, they breathe in more the same way that children drink more and eat more per kilo than adults do. So they take in a much higher volume of all those substances. And physiologically their airways are smaller. So if the airways constrict they have less distance to go in order for them to narrow to the point of triggering a crisis. definitions for an epidemic. But it's certainly a very huge and growing concern. I think in some ways you could probably say it's an epidemic. It's a very important health issue and it's not going away. Numbers are increasing in children. It's a very sad thing. We live in a very well developed country. We are a very rich country. There's no reason that we should be causing as many of our children. That's what we're doing. The way that we develop our cities, the way that we develop our country, especially the way that things are going now is actually going to get worse and better too. We don't have enough stringent laws about car emissions. Cars are very energy inefficient at the moment. And that's really, because we're allowing manufacturers to do that, we don't have strong enough laws for that. For me, asthma, when I picture asthma to be is when you're exerting yourself, you're doing an exercise and you can't breathe like your windpipe constricts and you can't force a breath down. I guess I've never had an asthma like symptom but when I push myself too hard in soccer or in another sport, of course you get out of breath and sometimes it's painful and you have to just calm down and sit down and take a breath and walk it off. But eventually they go away. I would think just physical exercise like pushing your lungs and your heart to your heart. But I'm sure if something in the air like pollution or dust particles or something I'm sure that could affect it. that this is your weakness so you have to try to run away and protect yourself from that if you're being attacked or something. Although it might seem like the situation is hopeless, this isn't true. There is hope. We can take measures to alter the environment for the next generation. We can help by having bicycles available, having bike lanes and having buses that are going to serve people who live in far areas as well as having trains and fighting for these amenities. Having a very good transportation system does make a very big difference as it helps to reduce asthma and it helps to reduce other diseases as well that are caused by people sitting in their cars and driving.

And if you are traveling in Movistar, we have the perfect plan for you. If you are a post-paid customer or a communication agent from abroad, receive and attend calls from 7.68 bolivars per minute. Send text messages by 2.8 bolivars each and receive them at the cost. In addition, chat on a VEGA with the data packages of 10, 20 or 50 megabytes. and activate your roaming service. Movistar, shared, life is more. We stayed at the Oyo 17, this par 5 of 531 yards waiting for the match made up by Colombian Oscar Álvarez, Diego Vanegas and Paraguayo Marco Ruiz. For the moment the best place for the Paraguayo Marco Ruiz that was 7 under the Par of the Golf Club Park. The Paraguayo that does not take advantage of this par 5 of the Oyo 17. And goes with a bogey in his card. And Oscar Álvarez making one of the best shots we managed to catch Pará Aguila with that pot so fast in the low. And Diego Anegas almost manages to poke his ball from the bunker and he leaves that short pot to see. And the last game where Jesus Amaya had confirmed himself as the leader of the tournament. 13 under the pair came for the moment. A round where the Argentine Luciano Giometti and the Venezuelan Alfredo Adrián had no luck improving his performance and staying on the tip of this tournament. And Alfredo Adrián with a unfortunate round, only 3 green, 7 pairs, 4 bogeys and 4 double bogeys left him out of competition for the last day. And now we go to the last hole with this last match of the tournament, par 4409 yards in his life. And a large number of fans present in the the golf club's barquissimeto facilities to enjoy an unprecedented event in the national golf, the largest bag played in Venezuela in the golf club barquissimeto, 134 players, 51 who are at the end of the week after overcoming the classification of one over the other. and the one who kept his performance, the Colombian, Estrella Jesus Amaya, completing 7 green, 9 pairs and just 2 buggies, to be located as the leader of the final round with 14 under the couple of the field. In the second place Rafael Romero with 10 blows under the field and third position Puerto Rican Rafael Campos with 9 blows under the field. For Oyo 19, the program of Golf de Venezuela is a real pleasure to take tournaments like this one next week.

Wenn ich Integration höre, dann ist es für mich, es kommen ganz unterschiedliche Bilder in mir auf und ganz unterschiedliche Verbindungen und Emotionen auch. Das ist einfach damit zu tun, dass Integration ein Thema ist, das schon so stark emotional besetzt ist in Österreich. Wenn man von Integration spricht, schaut sich die Medien an, denkt man gleich mal an eine Frau mit Kopf durch. Oder man denkt an Menschen, die vielleicht etwas schlechter Deutsch sprechen. Und im Generellen einen Menschen mit einer Kreuzonsintergrund. Bei mir kommt immer dieses Bild, es ist die Aufforderung da, Teil von dieser Gesellschaft zu werden. Sind sie denn nicht schon längst Teil dieser Gesellschaft? Als Integrationsbeauftragte der Islamischen Glaubensgemeinschaft in Wien hat Amani Abu-Sara einen geschärften Blick auf die diesbezügliche Debatte in Österreich. Und in ihrer Funktion als Lehrerin für islamische Religion kennen sie die Hürden. Bildung sei einer der Eckpfeiler für Akzeptanz in Österreich, sagt sie. Andererseits hat sie das Gefühl, dass oft muslimische Frauen, ob gebildet oder nicht, in einen Tapf geworfen werden. Eine muslimische Frau kann sich von einer weiteren muslimischen Frau in so vielen unterschiedlichen Dingen unterscheiden. Und es würde uns gut tun, diese Differenzierungen auch zuzulassen, diese Vielfältigkeit. so wissen wir Bescheid, dass die österreichischen Frauen vielfältige Frauen sind. Und es gilt auch mitzubedenken, dass auch muslimische Frauen österreichische Frauen sind. Dass auch hier eine Immense Diversität da ist. Hartnäckig hält sich der Vorwurf, muslimische Frauen sind generell integrationsunwillig. Für Amane Aboussara ist die sein völlig halbloses Vorurteil. Dennoch heißt es oft, muslimische Frauen würden nicht an der Gesellschaft teilnehmen. Wie ist das erklärbar? Was bedeutet integrationsunwillig bitter? Die letzten Studien zeigen auch das Gegenteil, dass es durchaus viele Jugendliche, jetzt nicht nur muslimische, auch Jugendliche, die mit einem migrantischen Geschichte haben, also dass es hier viel mehr dieses Bekenntnis einer Vielfach-Identität gibt. Muslim und Österreicher zu sein. Was sich so einfach anhört, scheint halt oft an der Realität. Vor allem, weil das Bild der muslimischen Frau noch immer verzerrt ist. Wenn es Missverständnisse gibt in Bezug auf Islam, ist es vor allem die Frau. Wenn man darüber spricht, was für ein Bild hast du beim Islam, was gibt es da für Probleme? Ganz ad hoc würde vielen einfallen Gewalt, Frau im Islam, sie ist unterdrückt, ist nicht berechtigt, etwas eigentlich nicht zu machen oder muss den Mann vorher fragen. Diese Aussagen machen ein gegenseitiges Verständnis nicht einfacher. Stimmen die gängigen Klischees über muslimische Männer? Bemühen sich Muslime in Österreich tatsächlich, alten Vorurteilen entgegenzutreten? kennt, dann wird es schwierig, an einer gemeinsamen Zukunft zu denken oder auch sozusagen zu sehen, Österreich ist ein gemeinsames Land für uns alle. Dann hat man immer so das Gefühl, ja die anderen müssen sich noch ein bisschen ändern. Also bei den anderen muss sich noch etwas tun. Muslimen sein heißt verantwortlich sein. Und insofern ist es, wenn man sich das aus der religiösen Perspektive anschaut, wie kann man beitragen zu dieser Gesellschaft auch eine Verantwortung, eine Verpflichtung, dass man sich hier engagiert, dass man sich für das Wohl der Bevölkerung einsetzt. Ich glaube, zum einen gilt es definitiv, das Selbstbild Österreichs zu verändern, zu überdenken und auch aufzumachen. Aufzumachen, indem man auch die Vielfalt wahrnimmt und die Vielfalt sieht, wie multikulturell und multireligös nicht schon längst ist, wie sich die Landkarte Europas auch verändert hat in Bezug auf Religion. und Kultur. Und das ist das eine und zum anderen auch, dass es eine Selbstverständlichkeit ist, dass muslimische Frauen, dass Muslime in der Gesellschaft präsent sind, aktiv sind und dass es nicht in Frage gestellt wird.","If you want to make an image of the integration of the West, you should visit the Brunnenmarkt. In this melting pot of culture, many erroneous and cleanliness of Austrian integration policy occurs. When I hear integration, it is for me, there are very different images in me and very different connections and emotions. It is simply to do with the fact that integration is a topic that is already so strongly emotionally involved in Austria. When you talk about integration, you look at the media and immediately think of a woman with a head. Or you think of people who speak a little bit of German. And in general, a person with a integration background. So for me, this image always comes to mind. It is the challenge to be part of this society. Don't you think so? As an integration officer of the Islamic faith team in Vienna, Amani Abu-Sara has a sharp look at the discussion on this topic in Austria. And in her function as a teacher for Islamic religion, she knows the Kurds. Education was one of the key factors for acceptance in Austria, she says. Otherwise she had the feeling that often Muslim women, whether they were educated or not, were thrown into a trap. A Muslim woman can distinguish herself from another Muslim woman in so many different ways. And it would be good to allow these differences, this diversity. So we know that the Austrian women are very often women. And it is also important to remember that Muslim women are Austrian women. That there is also an immense diversity here. Hardly, the accusation is held, Muslim women are generally unwilling to integrate. For Amane Abu-Sara, this is a completely unethical judgment. Nevertheless, it is often said that Muslim women would not participate in society. How is that explainable? What does integration mean? The last studies also show the opposite. That it is more of a Muslim, not only Muslim, but also of a Muslim who have a migrant history. That there is a lot more of this knowledge and a lot more identity here. To be Muslim and Austrian. What seems to be so easy often seems to be the reality. Especially because the image of the Muslim woman is still always distorted. If there is misunderstanding regarding Islam, Is it especially women? If you talk about what you have in mind about Islam, what are the problems? A lot of talk would be about violence against women in Islam. It is not justified to do something wrong or you have to ask the man beforehand. These statements make a counter-intelligence understanding not easier. Do the common clichés about Muslim men agree? Do Muslims in Austria actually have to face old prejudices? If you know the truth, it will be difficult to think of a common future. Or to see Austria as a common country for all of us. Then you always have the feeling that the others have to change a little. With the others you have to do something. Being a Muslim is called responsible. And insofar as you look at it from a religious perspective, how can you contribute to this society, to a responsibility, to a obligation, to be committed here, to the well-being of the population. The Muslim population is also wearing the state recognition of Islam in Austria. Nevertheless, the criticism of Amani Abusarra is justified. Many Muslims do not feel involved in political and social processes. I think it is definitely important to change the self-image of Austria, to think about it and to make up for it. To make up for the diversity and the diversity of how multicultural and multi-religious it has not been for a long time, how the map of Europe has changed in relation to religion. and culture. And that is one thing, and secondly, that it is a self-understanding, that Muslim women are active in society, and that it is not questioned."

Today I'm going to talk to you about an antioxidant called pycnogenol. This botanical extract is available in dietary supplements, multivitamins, as well as cosmetic products and is widely known to have significant health benefits supported by science. Pycnogenol is a natural plant extract that originates from the bark of the French maritime pine tree grown on the coastal region of southwestern France. Pine trees from which pycnogenol is produced are grown in an unspoiled and natural forest environment and represent Europe's largest forest. The healing powers of pine bark have been used for centuries by North American Indians. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier and his crew fell ill with scurvy. They were nursed back to health by drinking prepared teas and other concoctions using pine needles and tree bark to relieve the scurvy, improve wound healing and for various other ailments. Tea was effective because the needles contained traces of vitamin C and the bark provided large quantities of bioflavonoids. Today, pine bark is still utilized for its medicinal benefits, which bring us to the current day use of pycnogenol. Pycnogenol is most commonly known as a super strength antioxidant, but its health benefits reach far beyond its antioxidant capabilities. The unique combination of prosanidins, bioflavonoids, and organic acids offer extensive health benefits for Now, there is promising hope for women living with menstrual discomfort. Clinical research suggests that pycnogenol provides significant health benefits for women, including improving the quality of life to women who suffer from painful periods, perimenopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, and pain associated with endometriosis. Research has found pycnogenol to be a natural anti-inflammatory, which provides the basis for the rationale to use pycnogenol to naturally moderate inflammatory pain sensation involved in menstrual disorders. To further substantiate this rationale, Pichonoginol has a patent for menstrual pain. The patent is a result of a multitude of research studies over the years demonstrating the extracts ability to soothe pain during menstrual periods and improve cramping by acting as a natural inflammatory. Published studies have revealed similar results with women recording a decrease in abdominal pain scores and use of less over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory of inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Study results showed women had significantly less abdominal pain when they had started taking pycnogenal three weeks before their period. The pain relief was even more pronounced during the following period, with the pain score reduced by 36% compared to pretreatment. A multi-center field study recently published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine shows women with menstrual pain who supplemented with pycnogenal experienced less pain and required pain medications during menstruation. The number of painful days decreased from an average of two days prior to supplementation with pycnogenol to one day. The cause of endometriosis is unknown, and treatment to fully cure it has yet to be developed. However, initial research published in the European Bulletin of Drug Research concludes that pycnogenol reduces abdominal pain by 80% and cramps by 77% with patients suffering from endometriosis, severe menstrual pain and chronic pelvic pain after surgery. Perimenopause, the stage when a woman begins to end her reproductive years, can last anywhere from two to eight years. Studies published in the Scandinavian Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reveal pycnogenal reduces climacteric symptoms such as hot flashes, depression, panic attacks, and other common symptoms associated with women entering menopause transition. The results suggest pycnogenal may serve as an alternative treatment to estrogen replacement therapy, which is the most common remedy for perimenopausal symptoms.

As the guidelines exist for recommended dosages, standard product formulas range from 30 mg to 100 mg per capsule or tablet. Science tells us that anywhere from 1 to 2 capsules or up to 100 mg of pycnogenol can be taken daily for maximum effectiveness. Look for pycnogenol as a standalone dietary supplement or in a combination formula in your local health food store, drug store, and grocery or on the internet.

Entonces, me molacacho es una palabra que en el slang lenguuche en España significa me gusta mucho. Entonces es un poco el criterio también que digo si yo siento un tema lo voy a sacar. No me importa si es tech house, tech su madre house o deep house o future no sé cuántos house, o sea yo no le pongo etiquetas a la música para mí la música es una y se llama música. Entonces no voy a poner barreras siempre que no me envíen un tema de hard dance o de Heartrans que no es un estilo con el que yo me identifique, sino que puede ser un tema de tech house pero que esté hecho con una impronta tal que cuando lo escuchas dices, hay alguien detrás que tiene gusto y entonces con los ritmos que me laten y que me mueven de verdad son los que verdaderamente tienen unos roots, unas raíces bastante que significan algo. Entonces para mí la música house es lo que bien decía el llamador. Si no entiendes la música de la casa, es una cosa espiritual. a diferentes disqueras por todo el mundo y eso ya le costaba 500 dólares solo el envío para ver si le hacía caso ahora por suerte tenemos email todo el mundo sabe lo que son emails de todo el mundo porque son públicos normalmente si no tenemos facebook tenemos páginas web oficiales tenemos myspace tenemos un montón de cosas entonces yo me centro mucho en lo que es mi página web www.willisanjuan.com y www.molacacho.com que es la página web del sello que la estamos desarrollando de nuevo otra vez ahora está ¿Qué bueno ha hablado con el amigo Willy San Juan? todo tú, que es bueno que estás aquí, que nos da gusto que platiquemos y bueno pues vamos a un vídeo, ¿te parece? Recordamos, recordamos, vamos con el vídeo que tenemos juntos de la rola de losing you que ya tenía un rato, vamos a recordarlo aquí en el programa pero presenta lo tú por favor. Bueno la verdad es que es un proyecto que en el estudio de Barcelona tuvimos el placer de concebir, arreglar y producir el señor Benjamin Hernandez, alias BJ y yo mismo, Willy San Juan, pues dejamos con el vídeo. ¡Más!","Hello, I'm Willy San Juan from Barcelona, Spain and you're watching Empor TV. and what are you doing in Mexico? I've said several times that 2010 is like the year of return for many people and you're taking back the famous Molacacho Records. This is something that for many years has dedicated to promoting electronic music, mainly the quality house, and I'm very happy that you're taking back the same philosophy. The philosophy of the label is the same as the beginning, It's about getting to know new talents, people who are very lucky to be travelling around the world for years. You realize that there are many people who need to expose their music, but that maybe because of the place where they live, they come to a city where there is nothing of that culture. And suddenly, when they have touched several doors, you know that there are people who take it as a very strong business. And of course, if you are not the one who is I'm not going to take your role out, I'm going to give you the opportunity if you keep doing good roles, we will continue working together and you have the door open now. How to develop as a DJ or as a producer and you are giving a very important opportunity, I think that somehow if there is a condition, it will be quality and commitment, maybe. Quality is always in the minds of the client, that is not the first thing they teach you when they talk about quality, I like the word molacacho in the slang language in spanish I like it a lot so it's a bit of a criteria that I say if I feel a song I'm going to get it out I don't care if it's tech house, tech, his mother house or deep house or future, I don't know how many houses I don't put labels on it, for me the music is one and it's called music so I'm not going to put barriers whenever I'm not in a hard dance song or hardtrance, which is not a style I identify with, but it can be a tech house, but it is made with such an imprint that when you hear it, you say, there is someone behind that has a taste and then with the rhythms that I feel and that really move me, they are the ones that really have roots, roots that mean a lot. So for me, the music, houses, what I said earlier, is called and you want to understand house music, it's a spiritual thing. We have emails, we have Facebook, we have official websites, we have MySpace, we have a lot of things. So I focus a lot on what my website is www.wilisanguan.com and www.molacacho.com, which is the website of the seal that we are developing again.

As pessoas que passaram pelo vício do álcool, da droga, a partir daqui deste ponto, pode começar a nova vida. É o movimento Cristo de Amor, que oportuniza as pessoas esta oportunidade que em outros locais, em outro lugar, eles não iriam encontrar. Hoje eu trago para você do programa da cidade uma pessoa que vai estar conversando com a gente, o Valdevilno Garcia. que passou, esteve lá embaixo, como diz o Marcelo lá no fundo da fossa e com certeza acabou tendo essa oportunidade se encontrando com uma nova vida. Quantos anos? As pessoas dizem que o álcool é uma porta que se abre para outros tipos de drogas, então você está confirmando realmente isso? Sim, o alcoilismo é uma porta de entrada para maconha, para o cigarro, para a cocaína, até mesmo hoje a droga que está matando muita gente, principalmente a juventude aí que é uma epidemia chamada crack, está matando muita juventude. Então, o alculismo é uma porta de entrada para as drogas. Foi um período em que, como tínhamos uma divulgação na imprensa, na televisão, sobre o problema da pessoa que se envolve com droga, que é uma página em branco, quer dizer, não existe nada que você possa escrever de bonito em uma trajetória, sim? É só tragédia. É só sofrimento, é só mentira. É só coisa ruim mesmo, né? Um drogado, ele não tem sonho, ele só tem pesadeira. É só coisa de loucura mesmo. Quantos anos você viveu nesse mundo e a partir de quando é que começou a vislumbrar algo de novo na sua vida? Quando eu cheguei aos 30 anos, com 29 para 30 anos, eu fiquei doente, né? É um cara do meu tamanho mais de 1,90m, pesando 60kg. E o que sobrou para mim foi meu pai e minha mãe que ficou cuidando de mim, na verdade. Porque aqueles amigos, entre aspas que eu tinha, aquelas amizades que estavam dentro da minha casa direto, sumiram todos. Então só ficou meu pai e minha mãe cuidando de mim. Foi aonde que eu pensei, falei eu vou morrer usando droga, vai acabar com a minha vida, e que vai a vida dos meus familiares. Essa é a coinha que é só no grupo? Isso. porque um grupo de jovem maranata na igreja católica me procurou um pessoal da juventude e eu aceitei esse pedido que me fizeram, um amigo meu Hugo chamou eu para esse encontro de três dias, eu não queria ir mas fui e cheguei lá e encontrei esse Deus maravilhoso, esse Jesus Cristo, esse Espírito Santo que é BTMI e eu fiz um propósito com eles de sair dessa vida do alcoholismo, do drogadismo Já faz 11 anos? E passando tudo de bom com essa nova vida de Deus, também como coordenador desse movimento, né? Sim, eu coordeno lá no Bom Pastor, a gente tem a reunião lá, toda segunda-feira, às 20 horas, é a reunião de grupo, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, é a reunião de apoio, porque a gente fala do movimento Cristo, mas é uma família, né? A gente tem uma família mesmo, é uma nova família. Eu tenho pai, tenho mãe, tenho irmãos, irmã, né? Meu cunhado, meu cunhado, minha escunhada, mas eu me sinto no movimento Cristo uma verdadeira família, verdadeira irmã-dade mesmo, né? Que aqui a gente tem o direito de falar sobre o alcoolismo, falar sobre as drogas, falar das nossas dificuldades que passamos.","We are a very special place here, for many people, an important point of departure for a corner in life, for new paths. People who passed through the vise of alcohol, drugs, from this point on, can start a new life. It is the movement of Christ of love, which opportunizes people to have this opportunity in other places, in other places they would not find. And today I bring you from the city program, a person who is talking to us, a Valdevino Garcia, Marcelo was there, in the back of the force, and he ended up having the opportunity to meet a new life. That's what he's talking about today, at this meeting point here at the São Francisco event. I'll guess a little bit about us. You started early in the alcohol, in the drug, did you start with alcohol or with drugs? We used to alcoholize ourselves inside the house, with the parents, with the parents. How old? At 12 years old, I was already alcoholizing. I was already dependent on alcohol. I was already dependent on alcohol, I used to alcoholize. And in the few days, during the night, I left the house, I stayed a little on the street, and suddenly I had contact with drugs. In the case of the shoe glue, ether, tin, gasoline, gasoline, and suddenly I found a raccoon. Then the other snowball started to grow. People say that alcohol is a door that opens for other types of drugs. So you are really confirming that, right? Yes, alcoholism is a door to a raccoon, to a cigar, to cocaine, even today the drug that is killing a lot of people, especially youth, which is an epidemic called crack, is killing a lot of youth. So, alcoholism is a gateway to drugs. Was it the period when we had a broadcast on the press, on television, about the problem of the person who involves with drugs? That is a white page, meaning there is nothing you can write about beauty in a trajectory, yes? It's just a tragedy. It's just suffering, it's just a lie. It's just a bad thing, a drug, it doesn't have a dream, it only has its nightmare, it's just crazy. How many years have you lived in this world? And from when did you start to remember something new in your life? I was practically 18 years old, 12 years old until I was 30 years old. When I got here at the age of 30, 29 to 30, I got sick. A guy of my size, more than 1.90 m, weighing 60 kg. And what left for me was my father and my mother who were taking care of me, actually. Because those friends that I had, those friends that were inside my house, disappeared. So my father and my mother were just taking care of me. That's where I thought. I said, I'm going to die using drugs, end my life, end my family life. This is the only thing that I got into in a group? because a group of young people, the group of young people from Maranata, in the Catholic Church, sought me, a person from the youth, and I accepted this request that they made me, a friend of mine, Hugo, called me to this meeting for three days, I didn't want to go there, but I went there, and I found this wonderful God, this Jesus Christ, this Holy Spirit, who is B.T.M.I. I made a proposal with them to leave this alcoholism, drug addiction, I've been in the hospital for 11 years. I've been in the hospital for 11 years and 5 months, taking care of drugs, prostitution, crime, all that bad stuff I've been through. And it's all good that this new life of God, as a coordinator of this movement, right? Yes, I coordinate in the good pastor, we have the meeting there every Monday at 20 o'clock, it's the group meeting, it's the meeting of support, because we talk about the Christian movement, it's a family, right? We really have a family, my new family. I have a father, I have a mother, I have brothers and sisters, my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law, but I feel in the Christian movement a real family, a real sisterhood, right? Because here we have the right to talk about alcoholism, talk about drugs, talk about our difficulties that we have gone through."

Of course, how many girlfriends do you have before you started this? Because with the handsome ones, if you come to sing, you have to have a lot of girlfriends, a fan club, Well, you have a fan club.

8aew-POsMIw,257,425,295,428,240,25.0,0.0,h264,News & Politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aew-POsMIw,Gingrich on the rise,ABC News 24: Tom Switzer says the most recent Republican debate shows Newt Gingrich firming as the main contender to challenge the preeminent Mitt Romney. Also discussed is the importance of America's budget problems to the 2012 presidential election.,"Republican presidential race, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Republican presidential debate",130,0,3,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/8aew-POsMIw.mp3,"Well to discuss the Republican debate I'm joined by Tom Switzer. He's a research associate at the University of Sydney's US Studies Center Tom. Thanks for coming in Andrew What's your view who won? I think that Lisa's probably right there was Nick Ingerich I think that he certainly sounded very articulate sound and substance. He's highly intelligent He does carry a lot of baggage from his time as Speaker of the House of Representatives in the mid-99 is comprehensively wrong-footed by Bill Clinton But in this field I thought he was a standout today now. I mean The problem for the Republicans is they're really searching for a conservative candidate. It's many people taking you, anyone but Mitt Romney who is the front runner. So does Newt Gingrich fit that bill? I think he probably does Andrew. I mean you're quite right. There are really two camps now in this primary race. There's Mitt Romney who's essentially the establishment candidate. He has a lot of money behind him, including a lot of his own, very wealthy businessman. But he does represent a fairly liberal position. He's from Massachusetts, a very liberal state. He's been accused of flip-flopping on a lot of issues, so he himself carries a lot of baggage. The ruled battle right now is who is going to win the conservative vote in the Republican primaries. Now we've had very few candidates who stood out. We've had former Texas, the current Texas Governor, Rick Perry. We've also had Herman Cain, the entrepreneur, Michelle Buckman, the Minnesota Congresswoman. And in one time we had Donald Trump. Now it looks like it will be New King which he'll avoid. seen massive blips in the campaigns for the likes of Herman Cain and also Rick Perry as you've already mentioned. Has anyone posed a threat to the candidacy of Mitt Romney at this stage? Well I think Newt Gingrich is probably the candidate because he's coming in fairly late. He had all sorts of problems in the northern summer. He lacked funding and he lost his staff as well. But bear in mind John McCain also lost his staff at the midpoint of 2007 and he came back to win the nomination. So I think that Gingrich has a lot of intellectual grunt This debate was hosted by the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation two of the leading think tanks He has a lot of connection with AI. So I think he would have appealed to that audience But the problem with Gingrich in the eyes of many people in America is that he doesn't appear to be presidential He flies off the handle some parts. Yeah, well, there's some truth to that I mean he's a polarizing figure and Bill Clinton Completely and utterly wrong footed him during the budget But then who has the best chance for the Republicans of beating Barrack Obama? America is a very polarised country. You've got 40% of Americans who identify themselves as conservative, about 20% identify themselves as liberals. But there's a big chunk that are independents. They come from fairly moderate measured states, swing seats in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. They're the ones who will determine who'll be the next president. Tom, we're also seeing a huge ideological divide over ways to cut this 15 trillion dollar debt the United States has. The Republicans want spending cuts. want tax hikes. How is this going to be solved? Well it won't be solved until we have an election. This is what the next next year's election will be all about. A battle between two competing philosophical visions. There's the Barack Obama Liberal Democratic agenda of big spending stimulus packages to help pump prime the economy versus the more deregulatory small government approach. That will be the clash of philosophies at the next election. Only then will we be able to establish what gets said because the moment divided government is clearly not working. The Republic and dominate the House representatives. The Democrats have a very wifey-thin majority in the Senate, but of course the President is a Democrat and he will veto anything that the Republicans try to put through in the legislature.","Well to discuss the Republican debate I'm joined by Tom Switzer. He's a research associate at the University of Sydney's US Studies Center Tom. Thanks for coming in Andrew What's your view who won? I think that Lisa's probably right there was Nick Ingrid I think that he certainly sounded very articulate sound and substance. He's highly intelligent He does carry a lot of baggage from his time as Speaker of the House of Representatives in the mid-99 is comprehensively wrong-footed by Bill Clinton But in this field, I thought he was a standout today now. I mean The problem for the Republicans is they're really searching for a conservative candidate. It's many people taking you, anyone but Mitt Romney who is the front runner. So does Newt Gingrich fit that bill? I think he probably does Andrew. I mean, you're quite right. There are really two camps now in this primary race. There's Mitt Romney who's essentially the establishment candidate. He has a lot of money behind him, including a lot of his own very wealthy businessman. But he does represent a fairly liberal position. He's from Massachusetts, a very liberal state. He's been accused of flip-flopping on a lot of issues. So he himself carries a lot of baggage. The ruled battle right now is who is going to win the conservative vote in the Republican primaries. Now we've had very few candidates who stood out. We've had former Texas, the current Texas Governor, Rick Perry. We've also had Herman Cain, the entrepreneur, Michelle Buckman, the Minnesota Congresswoman. And in one time we had Donald Trump. Now it looks like it will be New King which he'll avoid. seen massive blips in the campaigns for the likes of Herman Cain and also Rick Perry as you've already mentioned. Has anyone posed a threat to the candidacy of Mitt Romney at this stage? Well I think Newt Gingrich is probably the candidate because he's coming in fairly late. He had all sorts of problems in the northern summer. He lacked funding. He lost his staff as well. But bear in mind John McCain also lost his staff at the midpoint of 2000. 2007 and he came back to win the nomination. So I think that Gingrich has a lot of intellectual grunt This debate was hosted by the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation two of the leading think tanks He has a lot of connection with AI. So I think he would have appealed to that audience But the problem with Gingrich in the eyes of many people in America is that he doesn't appear to be presidential He flies off the handle some part. Yeah, well, there's some truth to that I mean he's a polarizing figure and Bill Clinton Completely and utterly wrong footed him during the budget negotiations into 1995 that culminated in the shutdown of the government. Gingrich never really recovered from that mishap. But look, the Republic of the Party is in a pretty bad way when it comes to nominating a candidate. I can't help but think that he's the best one for the conservative wing of the party to take on Romney. What happens in late December and early January for the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary race to be seen? But then who has the best chance for the Republicans of beating Barak Obama? Yeah, I think that's exactly right. I think Romney largely because he can appeal to the independence America is a very polarized country. You've got 40% of Americans who identify themselves as conservative, about 20% identify themselves as liberals. But there's a big chunk that are independents. They come from fairly moderate measured states, swing seats in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. They're the ones who will determine who'll be the next president. Tom, we're also seeing a huge ideological divide over ways to cut this 15 trillion dollar debt the United States has. The Republicans want spending cuts. want tax hikes, how is this going to be solved? Well it won't be solved until we have an election. This is what the next next year's election will be all about. A battle between two competing philosophical visions. There's the Brackabamba Liberal Democratic agenda of big spending stimulus packages to help pump prime the economy versus the more deregulatory small government approach.

Kennedy was a tax-cutting cold warrior who twice tripled America's military presence in the Vietnam War to try to stop the spread of communism and risk the death of the United States. nuclear disaster by standing up to the Soviet Union in Cuba. He was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald, an American hating leftist who had once defected to the USSR. Now, the culture. In Oliver Stone's film JFK, nominated for Best Picture Oscar in 1991, Kennedy is a peaceful lefty contemplating the withdrawal from Vietnam. He's assassinated by a vast right-wing cabal that includes every single person in America, except for Oliver Stone. culture. Can you spot the difference? Here's another. Isn't this fun? In reality, Terry Shiva was a severely brain-damaged woman who was judicially starved to death in 2005 at the request of her husband, while evangelical Christian right-to-life groups unsuccessfully petitioned to keep her alive. In the culture, a 2005 episode of Law and Order entitled Age of Innocence depicted a severely brain-damaged woman whose husband tried to euthanize her. until he was murdered at the instigation of an evangelical Christian right to life. In reality, evangelical Christians try to keep people alive in the culture they murder people. That's a subtle one I know, but can you spot the difference? Let's try again. In reality, anthropological studies have shown that primitive societies are even more violent than civilized ones. Primitive life is pretty miserable in general, with no protection against drought or famine, no medicine, so that even the simplest diseases be deadly and no equality for women who have zero defense against pregnancy or oppression. Now let's look at the culture. In films such as Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas and now Avatar, which are really all the same film, a civilized man enters primitive society and finds its values far superior to his own. The collectivist natives are peaceful, the women are treated with respect, and ancient forms of medicine work as well as modern ones. Spot the difference? Right. In reality, it's civilized So when you go to see Avatar and enjoy its special effects and 3D imagery, just think to yourself, wow, we'd never have anything as cool as that if we lived like the Indians. I mean, they never even invented the wheel. Hey, and speaking of Avatar, it not only celebrates being at one with the sacred earth, but portrays US soldiers as evil sadists out to destroy native peoples. Can you spot the difference between the two? between Avatar and, say, Haiti, where our old pal, the sacred earth, slaughtered innocent people in their thousands, and the US military turned out in a massive rescue effort. But in our culture, the US military is always evil. Housewives are always desperate, corporations are always corrupt, and poverty is always the fault of wealthy people's greed. Can you spot the difference between those assumptions and reality? If you can't, you're probably a liberal. And a knucklehead.

He was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald, an American hating leftist who had once defected to the USSR. Now, the culture. In Oliver Stone's film JFK, nominated for Best Picture Oscar in 1991, Kennedy is a peaceful lefty contemplating the withdrawal from Vietnam. He's assassinated by a vast right-wing cabal that includes every single person in America, except for Oliver Stone. culture. Can you spot the difference? Here's another. Isn't this fun? In reality, Terry Shiva was a severely brain-damaged woman who was judicially starved to death in 2005 at the request of her husband, while evangelical Christian right-to-life groups unsuccessfully petitioned to keep her alive. In the culture, a 2005 episode of Law and Order entitled Age of Innocence depicted a severely brain-damaged woman whose husband tried to euthanize her. until he was murdered at the instigation of an evangelical Christian right to life. In reality, evangelical Christians try to keep people alive in the culture they murder people. That's a subtle one, I know. But can you spot the difference? Let's try again. In reality, anthropological studies have shown that primitive societies are even more violent than civilized ones. Primitive life is pretty miserable in general, with no protection against drought or famine, no medicine, so that even the simplest diseases be deadly and no equality for women who have zero defense against pregnancy or oppression. Now let's look at the culture. In films such as Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas and now Avatar, which are really all the same film, a civilized man enters primitive society and finds its values far superior to his own. The collectivist natives are peaceful, the women are treated with respect, and ancient forms of medicine work as well as modern ones. Spot the difference? Right. In reality, it's civilized So when you go to see Avatar and enjoy its special effects and 3D imagery, just think to yourself, wow, we'd never have anything as cool as that if we lived like the Indians. I mean, they never even invented the wheel. Hey, and speaking of Avatar, it not only celebrates being at one with the sacred earth, but portrays US soldiers as evil sadists out to destroy native peoples. Can you spot the difference between the two? between Avatar and, say, Haiti, where our old pal, the sacred earth, slaughtered innocent people in their thousands, and the US military turned out in a massive rescue effort. But in our culture, the US military is always evil. Housewives are always desperate, corporations are always corrupt, and poverty is always the fault of wealthy people's greed. Can you spot the difference between those assumptions and reality? If you can't, you're probably a liberal. And a knucklehead. This is Andrew Claven, On The Culture."

Adjust the nuts on the threads until the plate collapses closely underneath the bearing. Next, slip the shaft and the separator onto the press table. You'll want to position it right underneath the ram of the press. Now with your safety goggles on, you're ready to press off the bearing. Operate the press lever until the press meets the splung firm them. Then proceed to push the shaft out of the bearing. And there you have it, another removed bearing. You're in the home stretch now, and it's time for your new bearing to be installed. You'll need something to drive the bearing back on, such as a sledge hammer. And a hollow, but sturdy driver like this. Lock the shaft back into the vise just like you did earlier, right on the welts. Make sure the vise is nice and tight. Now take your new bearing and slip it over the spline and move it all the way down to the seating area. Slide your driver over the spline, resting it against the bearing itself, then drive the bearing onto the shaft. This will take several strikes. Continue to drive the bearing onto the shaft until it bottoms out firmly at the base. Congratulations, your new bearing is installed. Go ahead and give it a spin. It should rotate smoothly.

Have people just completely lost their mind or do they not know how to drive and walk on streets anymore? You're driving along and people just walk out in front of you. They don't even look, they don't wait. You're on a main thoroughfare and they just book out in front of you like it's no big deal. and it's not like it's at a crosswalk. They're in the middle of the freaking street and they do it. And they expect you to stop. Personally, I'd like to just run them over. But I suppose I'd get in trouble over that. And waiting, and waiting for stupid people. Why have people forgotten or can't learn what to do with stop signs anymore? They sit there and they stare at you and or they just take off. They don't even stop anymore. You get four people coming in coming up to a stop sign, none of them stop. I've seen at least two accidents in the last two weeks involving cars and stop signs because people don't even stop, they just blow right through them or they just, they think a stop sign means yield. Stop sign means stop. That means you come to a complete stop, use your frickin' blinker if you're gonna turn, you idiot, and then continue on your way if there's nobody in your path. But for whatever reason, people have just lost their mind in regards to stop signs. See now there's a really cool idea. Now they have those around town here all over the place. That's a flashing stop sign so that people will stop at an intersection and not just blow through it. Here's another thing that bugs me about drivers today. Why are they constantly blast in their horns? When there's no good reason for it. They see somebody, they blast their horn. They pass by somebody's house, they're blast in their horn. Now if you're driving down the road and you've got a lot of traffic going on and people are blasting their horn waving and hoping that somebody in a house, what are they going to do? Somebody's going to run to the window and see who blew the horn? No! So why are you blowing your horn when you drive by someone's house? Stop it! They don't even care! All you're doing is ticking them off. Use your horn what it was designed for, which is to notify people that around you that something is wrong. that somebody's in your way or you're about to crash into them because they pulled out in front of you. That's a good reason to use your horn. Looking for a road right now that I can't seem to find. While we're on the subject of cars and traffic and roads, another one are bicyclists of today. They must think they own the goddamn road. They don't. I'm a lot bigger than you and I've got a lot more momentum behind me. So if you go wheeling out in front of me at a stop sign or in the middle of the road and I'm already taken off, guess what? I'm plowing your ass over. Don't pull out in front of somebody or don't just weave across the road expecting everybody to look out for your sorry ass. You know another thing that bugs me is why some old people still have their driver's license. Now in my opinion if you can't see above yourself steering wheel. And all I can see from behind you is a tough of gray hair and some knuckles. Then you shouldn't be driving. That's all I gotta say. Okay, so remember gas prices are going to be going up. The price of oil has risen almost $90 barrels. So go get your gas tanks filled up. I can expect extra gas because it's going to go through the ceiling. And that's pretty much all that mattered to me today. So that's my opinion. And I'm James Alexander. On the road again Can't wait to get back on the road again Yeah","Hi, it's Wednesday April 7th, 2010 and I'm James Alexander. I'd jump in my truck and drive over burning as much fuel in the process as possible. So I guess I'd better do a show while I'm walking one of these days as well. So probably do that coming up. OK, so let's talk about a few things for today. One of the things I was reading last night was that oil prices are almost up to $90 a barrel right now. They are really getting really hot. up there. So if you need gas, you better go get it because gas prices are about to go through the ceiling yet again. Have people just completely lost their mind or do they not know how to drive and walk on streets anymore? You're driving along and people just walk out in front of you. They don't even look. They don't wait. You're on a main thoroughfare and they just book out in front of you like it's no big deal. and it's not like it's at a crosswalk they're in the middle of the freaking street and they do it and they expect you to stop Personally I'd like to just run them over but I suppose I'd get in trouble over that and Waiting and waiting for stupid people why have people forgotten or can't learn what to do with stop signs anymore? They sit there and they stare at you and or they just take off they don't even stop anymore and you get four people coming coming up to a stop sign, none of them stop. I've seen at least two accidents in the last two weeks involving cars and stop signs because people don't even stop. They just blow right through them or they just they think a stop sign means yield. Stop sign means stop. That means you come to a complete stop, use your frickin' blinker if you're gonna turn, you idiot, and then continue on your way if there's nobody in your path. But for whatever reason, people have just complete lost their mind in regards to stop signs. See now there's a really cool idea. Now they have those around town here all over the place. That's a flashing stop sign so that people will stop at an intersection and not just blow through it. Here's another thing that bugs me about drivers today. Why are they constantly blast in their horns? When there's no good reason for it. They see somebody they blast their horn. They pass by somebody's house. They're blast in their horn. Now if you're driving down the road and you've got a lot of traffic going on and people are blasting their horn waving and hoping that somebody in a house, what are they going to do? Somebody's going to run to the window and see who blew the horn? No! So why are you blowing your horn when you drive by someone's house? Stop it! They don't even care! All you're doing is ticking them off. Use your horn what it was designed for which is to notify people around you that something is wrong. that somebody's in your way or you're about to crash into them because they pulled out in front of you. That's a good reason to use your horn. Looking for a road right now that I can't seem to find. While we're on the subject of cars and traffic and roads, another one are bicyclists of today. They must think they own the goddamn road. They don't. I'm a lot bigger than you and I've got a lot more momentum behind me. So if you go wheeling out in front of me at a stop sign or in the middle of the road and I'm already taken off, guess what? I'm plowing your ass over. Don't pull out in front of somebody or don't just weave across the road expecting everybody to look out for your sorry ass. You know another thing that bugs me is why some old people still have their driver's license. Now in my opinion if you can't see above yourself and on the road again can't wait to get back on the road again yeah"

Pewnie większość z nich już przekroczyłeś. Czujesz się jak taki bilartowy Leo Messi w Polsce? Czy Leo Messi czuje się oczywiście dobrze z tymi rynkotami? To potwierdza, że stale uczucie poziom i widać to po prostu w turnierach, w których gram. Każde Leo Messi musi mieć swojego Pepa Guardiola. W tym przypadku Pepem jest twój tata. Duże zasługie, jeżeli chodzi o twoje sukcesy, bardzo dużo na ten temat mówi i ma rację. Powiedz mi, czy mając tyle medali, ile ty masz, ja się pomyliłem w liczeniu, więc nie będę przytacza dokładnej liczby. Zdarza ci się czasem powiedzieć, że jednak się z nim nie zgadzasz w kwestii metod szkoleniowych? No, czy wiem dobrze, że ta ta ma większości właśnie tych argumentów racje, ale no niekiedy mam też swoje tam jakieś odczucia, które, które mi się chęli, Wiem z pewnych źródeł dość wiary gotnych, że troszeczkę nietypowo przygotowujesz się do mistrzostw Polski. Tam inna dyscyplina wchodzi w grę, zechcesz zradzić kilka szczegółów? Ale naprawdę, czy to trenujesz po 6 godzin dziennie na co dzień? Jak się tak trenuje? ale to potwierdzę, że stale utrzymuje poziom. No tak, ty jesteś teraz tą górną granicą poziomu, jeżeli chodzi o juniorów na razie tych młodszych, wkrótce pewnie też tych starszych. Wiesz, chyba zgodzi się ze mną, że masz tyle lat, jesteś w takim wieku, że jednak bardzo dużo czasu możesz poświęcić na billard. Te obowiązki jeszcze nie są tak absorbujące. Nie obawiasz się, że kiedy pójdziesz powiedzmy do liceum, kiedy będziesz musiał martwić się maturą, potem studiami będziesz miał troszeczkę mniej czasu na treningi, na grę. Jeszcze tak szczerze, że tu nigdy o tym nie myślałem, bo właśnie mam tą pierwszą gimnazją i jeszcze nie myślę aż takimi dalszymi, choćby szczegółami, no ale jakoś będę starał się pogodzić właśnie szkołę z bilardem, żeby to działało w dwie dobre strony. Dobrze, wiesz co teraz? Postaram się wprawić w lekkie zakłopotanie. Komu zadedykujesz przez medale? Każdy z osobna. Każdy z osobna? Może tego roszto, żeby nie było, że jestem zgryźliwy. No to zadykuję na pewno tak. Złoty jeden to zadykuję tacie za właśnie pracę, którą wyszliśmy razem, żeby osiągnąć te sukcesy. Mamie za stare wsparcie, ten drugi medal. Srebro to... Wiktorowi, bo mnie pokonał w finale. I to od niego też mnie zależało, że miałem te Srebro. A Brąz to nie wiem, moje całej rodziny, że mnie wspiera. Nie, jeszcze mam czas. ważniejsze? No miło wszystko to mistrzostwo Europy to jest mój największy cel jak na razie iniorów oczywiście bo to tam właściwie będę grał z rówieśnikami i to powiedzmy będzie bardziej wpływało na mnie tak bo to jednak są to jest mój wiek a nie tam jakieś osoby które są dużo starsze no ale każde mistrzostwa są ważne. Dobrze jeszcze tylko ostatnie pytanie takie powiedzmy bardziej merytoryczne kiedy rozmawiałem z twoim tatą Jak mówił, że nie wie do końca na co cię stać w tych mistrzostwach, jesteś właśnie w takim wieku, że rozbijasz się strasznie dynamicznie tych centymetrów, ci bardzo dużo przybyło. Czy ty też bałeś się, że to będzie miało wpływ na twoją grę? w którym powinienem się aż tak doskonale znacie szczegóły fizjologiczne, dlatego teraz Ci już podziękuję Danielu. Naprawdę dziękuję Ci za tym istrzostwo, mecze, które grałeś na stole telewizyjne, które mogłem komentować. Naprawdę była przyjemność i chwila ulgi. Dlatego życzę Ci wszystkiego najlepszego w tym roku, nie tylko bilardowo, ale także w życie osobistym. I powodzenia dalej.","Daniel, do you feel like a billboard Leo Messi in Poland? I'm very happy that you have a lot of success in this subject. Tell me, do you have so many medals, how many do you have? I've been thinking about it, so I won't tell you the exact number. Sometimes it happens to you to say that you don't agree with them in the school matter? I mean, I know that dad has a lot of arguments, but I also have my own feelings, I understand that you understand it very well. I know from certain sources that you are preparing for the Polish championship. There is a different discipline in the game. Do you want to add some details? I train for the whole year. I train with my master's and I also do easier training like snorkeling. I go to play football because the condition is very important. Most of the time I train more than I usually do in the club. I train 6 hours a day. Do you really train 6 hours a day? I don't say that I train, but it's said that if you train the best, you train 6 hours a day. I train for 4 hours. It's impressive. The last year was absolutely a domination. 4 finals and 1 gold. This year is a bit worse. It's a phenomenal result. I feel that you will have to deal with other competitors, medals, growth, danger of victory in the ring and victory in the ring. I think you will be playing with him in the next years? Yes, Victor is a very young player, he has many medals and there are a few players who can lose, who can be played like Christian Tviko, who made it to the final twice this year. but I confirm that Stale is at his level. You are now the top-level player of the junior level, for now the younger ones, and probably the older ones. I think you agree with me that you are so old that you can spend a lot of time on the billboard. These duties are not yet so absorbing. Don't be afraid that when you go to the high school, when you have to get a temperature, after that you will have a little less time for training and playing. I haven't thought about it yet, because I have the first gym and I don't think about it yet, even with such long details. But I will try to get along with the billard school to work on two good sides. I will try to make myself a little bit cheaper. Who do you dedicate to medals? Each person? Each person? Maybe this year, so I'm not too greedy. I dedicate my money to my father for the work we've done together to achieve these successes. I have this second medal for the old support. I won the final because of Victor. I also wanted to win the silver medal. And I don't know, I don't know, my whole family supported me. I was trying to ask this question to find out if there is a young lady who could dedicate success to you, but not to you as far as I can see. I still have time, 13 years. It's still a girl, it's a lot. Metryka says 13 years, medals could have been experienced that you are 50 years old, so it's hard to say. Daniele, what do you feel this year? What kind of start will you set? I know that the game will also be a senior competition, so tell me how will you limit it? He said that he doesn't know what to do with you in these championships. You are in such age that you are breaking down very dynamically. You have a lot of centimeters. Did you also fear that it would affect your game? Well, I mean... I know, every one of them has his own problems that he has to go through. I don't know... I don't know what to ask. I'm sure you know the details of the game, so I thank you for that. I really thank you for the support of the match, which I could comment on on the TV. It was really a pleasure. I wish you all the best this year, not only in the Bielard, but also in your personal life. Good luck!"

We also set that whenever a fire in Juva produces a disaster, the car blocks the access to the back of the block. It is very dangerous because it has been built by our block without any authorization, The family managed to obtain all the necessary documents to be demolished, but the representatives of the urban management service do not keep the necessary equipment.

What we've been able to do is harness naturally occurring frequencies and program them into a Mylar hologram to help improve your balance, your strength and your flexibility. I'm here with a Colo and what we're going to demonstrate for you are three power balance tests. First what we're going to do with a Colo is demonstrate the balance test. So Colo if you would put your feet together for me or arms straight out to your side. What you're going to want to do is when you perform this test is make sure that they have their arms stiff in a firm position so that you push down they can resist. the person that you're testing into this position. So they can understand what's about to occur. You want them to be able to feel the resistance you're going to place on their arm. So I'm going to push straight down, resist, don't let me push down. Good. Now what you're going to want to do is have them lift their left leg and find their balance point. Good. Once they're up and have found their balance point, you're going to push down again on the same place of their arm. So a cologne, again, resist. I'm going to tell you to tip over. Good. Now what you're going to want to do is perform the same thing only with the power balance on. One of the great things about this product is that they don't actually need to be wearing it. They can either be holding it. I could set it on the top of his head. It wouldn't matter. All that matters is that the product is within one to three inches of your body's energy field. So now recreate the exact same test. Feet together, arms out, lift that left leg. Using the same point on the elbow, we'll push down again and resist. A little bit of a difference? Yeah, considerably. All right. All right. Now that we've increased your balance, let's show them how this product can impact strength. What we're going to do is we've got a colo here. Pretty strong guy, right? Work out. Got the whole deal. Got some nice shoulders. to do for me. Put your feet together, hands right here at your side. What I want you to do is grip my fist tight. I'm going to push straight down. I want you to resist. Do not let me push you over. So make sure when you're pushing that you're not pulling away, but you're pushing straight down. So same thing again. We're going to put the product on. And once again, it doesn't matter. The fact that he's wearing which wrist doesn't matter as long as it's within his body's energy field, it's going to function. All right, here we go. Come on, you got more than that. Obviously, a tremendous increase. So we've demoed strength and we've demoed balance. Now let's do the flexibility demonstration. For this one, we're going to have him start facing the camera so that you can understand it. Then we're going to allow the camera to mark his rotation. So what you would like to do is again, feet together, same position as always. Right arm straight out. Pointing straight ahead. For the sake of this, turn and face away. All the way for me. Now what I want you to do is rotate back as far as you possibly can. Mark the point with your eyes. Trace your arm with your eyes as far as you can. Is that it right there? Yeah. Go ahead and return. Now let's put the product on. Same thing for me. A lot farther. Noticable difference, huh? Yeah, for sure. Absolutely.","What I have to demonstrate for you today is a revolutionary new product.

Sí, porque tú sabes, si el asaro muere y Jesús llega ahí a las 2 horas y dice, no, se estaba durmiendo y no había muerto nada. Jesucristo, cuando hay momentos difíciles en tu vida y Jesucristo cuando le decían, corre pa aquí, corre pa allá, él iba y ayudaba a la gente. En este caso, Marte y María lo mandan a llamar. Tenemos alásaro, enfermo y está que se muere, pero Jesús ya sabía que él había muerto porque había un camino casi de día donde estaba Jesús. Jesús ya sabía que él ya se iba a morir. Entonces ¿qué ocurrió aquí? Jesús no arrancó a correr de una vez para allá. Muchas veces ocurren situaciones en nuestra vida y empezamos. Señor, mira esto, señor, mira lo otro, señor. Y usted ve que Jesús no hace nada. Jesús está esperando que tu problema esté bien, bien muerto, pero bien muerto. Señor, mire la renta del templo en Nueva York y no hay plata para pagar la renta. Ya es 29, ya es 30 y no llega. Porque el Señor quiere que llegue el último día, el último día. ¿Sí me entienden? Para que cuando llegue esa bendición diga realmente, Jesucristo resucitó a la ilusión ese muerto que tenía. Señor, llevo tanto día, mi marido se fue y no ha regresado. Y Jesús allá tranquilo en su trono, esperando. Porque él quiere que el marido se vaya bien ido, bien, bien ido para que cuando te lo traiga, le lucha, diga realmente, Dios me trajo mi esposa, Dios me trajo mi esposo, Dios me trajo esto. Así es que agoré el Señor. Aplauden, señor Amen. Señor me enferme y entra al hospital. el hermano, el hermano. Él cree que va a salir al otro día. Y cuando el hospital empieza a hacerle los exámenes y venga pa aquí, venga pa allá, no. Te no puede salir hoy. Y usted orando, señora, haz el milagro y está esperando, pues. Porque tú sabes, el ego del hombre, no. Yo quiero ser el chau men. O sea, yo quiero ser la estrella del hospital que, oh, Cristo lo sanó. La estrella es Jesús. No somos nosotros. Entonces, usted dice, no, yo ya, usted ya empieza a hacer planes, no. Jesús me sana mañana, hacer milagro, el miércoles, ella el viernes algo. voy a la playa, estoy haciendo planes en el hospital. Tú sabes, no, eso me va a sanar, me levanta aquí, papá, papá, y voy aquí a hacer tal... No. Mire, muchas personas entran al hospital, pasan ocho días, nada. Pasan dos semanas, nada. Antes al revés, cada vez que entra el médico con la cara, el médico dice, usted está como que peor. Es más, como que ya le van alistando la autotzia. Y usted, ui, señor, yo vine aquí para que... Yo vine aquí por una tos, una gripe y me adnosticaron un poco de cosas raras que no tenía. Y es porque el Señor quiere a Le Lulla que eso que está ocurriendo en tu vida lo mismo se lo hizo a Marta y a María. Él espero dos días, dos días. Y caminando un día más, imagínate, tres días para llegar allá a donde estaba Lázaro, porque el Señor quiere que tu situación tu problema, tu momento difícil, esté bien, bien, bien muerto. Que ya no haya esperanza de nada. Señor, yo ya tengo 35 años y soy una mujer y las de veinte se están cazando y nadie me voltea a mirar a mí y pasa año tras año y yo voy por los 38 y nada. Y Jesús esperando, yo voy para los 40, señor, y nada. y el señor esperando, y el hermano orando por un esposo, y el señor esperando. ¿Por qué? Porque cuando Dios te trae que ese hombre, ese esposo, tú vas a decir, realmente, esto es un milagro de Dios. Cuánto la van a clavar el Señor. ¡Ale lucha! Imagínate una niña de 20 y","that the last hour that the other two of the other than the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of the other one of Jesus knew that he was going to die. So what happened here? Jesus didn't run away from there. Many times, situations happen in our lives. We start saying, Lord, look at this, Lord, look at the other Lord. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. And you see that Jesus does nothing. Jesus is waiting for your problem to be well, well-dead. But still, well-dead. Lord, look at the income of the temple in New York, and there's no money to pay the income. It's twenty-nine, it's thirty, and it's not enough. Because the Lord wants it to be the last day. The last day. Do you understand me? So that when that blessing comes, he really says, Jesus Christ resuscitated that dead man who was. God brought me my wife. God brought me my husband. God brought me this. That's how I pray, Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. He thinks he will go out the next day. And when hospitals start doing the tests, and he says, come here, come there, no. You can't go out today. And you're praying, Lord, do the miracle, and you're waiting. Because you know, the ego of man, I want to be the showman. I mean, I want to be the star of the hospital, that Christ healed. The star is Jesus. We are not us. So you say, no, you're already starting to do plans, no. Jesus, come tomorrow, do the miracle, the Wednesday, and Friday is something. I'm going to the beach, I'm making plans in the hospital. You know, Jesus is going to heal me, he gets up here, and I'm going to do this. No, look, many people go to a hospital, spend eight days, nothing, spend two weeks, nothing. Before the reverse, every time the doctor comes in with his face, the doctor says, you're like, what's worse, it's like they're going to list the autopsy. And you, oh, sir, I came here to... I came here for a toast, a flu, and I was a little bit surprised by strange things I didn't have. And it's because the Lord loves him, that what is happening in your life, the same thing, was done to Martha and to Maria. He waited two days, two days, and walking one more day, imagine three days, to get there where Lazarus was, because the Lord wants your situation, Your problem, your difficult moment, is very, very, very dead. There is no hope for anything. Sir, I'm 35 years old and I'm a woman. And the 20 of us are getting married. And no one is looking at me. And it's been years, years and years. And I'm 38 years old and nothing. And Jesus is waiting. I'm 40 years old and nothing. And the Lord is waiting. And the brother is praying for a husband. And the Lord is waiting. Why? Because when God brings you that man, that husband, you will really say, this is a miracle of God. How much glory does the Lord have? Alleluia! Imagine a 20-year-old girl"

Lo conocí en París y cuando me dijeron que era un cantautor y maño, le dije, chica, dónde vas, chica a la farmacia, chica pa' quire, chica pa' mi chica, chica que le pasa, chica que está mala, chica que se aliví, chica muchas gracias. Entonces me dice, andá, no sabía que eras maño. Así nos conocimos. José Antonio nunca abandonado la reivindicación. Homenaje a Yoyes, la exetarra asesinada por Eta. Concierto contra la entrada en la OTAN. Y contra el plan hidrológico nacional. siempre, y el canto la libertad. Una canción que ha hecho historia y que se propuso para ser el himno de Aragón. borrachos ya no la cantamos a ningún lado, ya se ha perdido. para cantar el cantorario. Preparamos siempre el final lo que vamos a cantar. Y dos minutos antes de llegar al final empezamos a discutir en el escenario. Hemos quedado de cantar esto. ¿Qué no cantamos esto? Es de Eduardo, esto Joaquín Senfada, porque tiene espíritu más de espectáculo que Eduardo y yo que dimos, ¡bam, baño! No pasa nada. Lo podremos hacer medianamente. Cuando estamos acabando de cantar dice, y ahora, quien compre el disco se lo dedicaremos. En Ejea de los Caballeros, cuando llevamos 120 dedicados, yo me fui ya porque estaba agotado. Una constante y humor nunca le ha abandonado. Tres décadas cantando y una veintena de discos publicados. La creatividad de José Antonio La Bordeta es similar en cantidad a la de Aute o a la de Joan Manuel Serrat. Es el cantautor aragones con más trascendencia, también porque ha sido el cantautor con más profundidad literaria. La Mila Vieja me gusta mucho, es una canción que la hice el año 68. Fija de esto. Y es como una eternura hacia las mujeres de la sierra del maestro. Siempre te recuerdo vieja, sentada junto al oar, acariciando la lumbre, la cadera y el pozal. La tristeza de tus ojos, de tanto mirar. Quiero llegar al mar, que desconozco. Ha abierto camino. Sus canciones han sido guía para otros, han cambiado de forma, pero no de esencia. Y del salto a la gran pantalla, en el 91 protagoniza el corto Carambú. ¿Vaya hombre, cima que le ofrezco mi ayuda y que le hago compañía? Llega la tele, recorrió España, mochila en mano. y preparando el hit. Estando de diputado, pues salía yo, había unas señoras allá al lado y salía yo en la televisión ahí cantando y entonces esto te quiero decir hace, pues hace cuatro años, ¿no? Y me dice una señora, mira, jodelo este. Ahora que se ha hecho famosa con la televisión, va y se pone a cantar también, ¿no? Entonces, si vea, es el año 68 que estoy cantando. Y a la cámara es que la engañas muy poquito rato, ¿eh? La engañas muy poco, la cámara es muy... es un espejo implacable. y la bordeta transmite verdad. Por eso siempre funciona. Haga lo que haga. Haga la mochila, o sea, con tertulio y los desayunos, porque transmite verdad. Colaborador de los desayunos de televisión española. Los espectadores decía, lo que yo estaba pensando, este señor lo decía en tu tertulio. Encima lo dice con sentido del humor. O sea, más es imposible. También ha participado en prensa escrita y en radio. Una tienda que se llamaba Gunmar la Francia. La bordeta, buenos días. Buenos días. El ínigo y la bordeta, la mañana del domingo, hacemos las puñetas. Él prometió una sintonía para el programa. El primer día no la tuvo ni el primero, ni el segundo, ni el tercero, ni el quinto, ni el séptimo. Nunca acababa la canción para que José María Iñigo pudiera puroñir un poquito y quejarse de la bordeta, que no haces nada. Yo le llamaba Vago. Y hace bien. Ahora, a estas edades, hace bien ser Vago. Es que me encanta esta canción, la voz detallada. Cuéntanos, alguna cosa que te haya pasado? Pues nada, me ha pasado que el otro día el miércoles era mi cumpleaños, pero tenía yo aquí mis dos nietas preparando la merienda para cuando de pronto pues me entró un templeque y acabé en el hospital. Mis nietas se quedaron tristísimas. Yo te llamé el día, tu cumpleaños. La Morena me dijo, abuelito, tenemos que apagar los 75, las 35 velas. Digo, pues ya las apagaremos cualquier día de esto. ¿Qué estamos esperando? Lo que parece que las tartas la han comido y de mi familia. Y yo le he dicho a Victoria, ahora vamos a ahora mismo, voy a comprar una tarta con 75 velas y me voy a plantar la puerta de su casa con la tarta para que sople delante de mí. ¿Te ha llegado? Sí, me ha llegado terrible. Hombre, no me digas terrible. No, terrible. Maravilloso. Con muchísima fuerza. Eso sí.","Little by little, the national borders became small. They traveled to Europe by guitar, and in their journey, José Antonio coincided with Silvia Rodríguez, Mercedes Sosa or Javier Kraé. I know him in Paris. And when they told me he was a singer and a dancer, I told him, girl, where are you going? Girl, to the pharmacy. Girl, to the caretaker. Girl, to my girl. Girl, what's wrong with you? Girl, who's sick? Girl, who's relieved? Girl, thank you very much. So he tells me, go. I didn't know you were a dancer. So we met. Romantic art. Jose Antonio never abandoned the re-indication. Homenaje a yoyes, the exetara, murdered by Eta. The flies dared to go out. There was a hard, heavy, plumbish atmosphere, a silence that you could cut with a knife. Concerto against the entrance in the OTAN. And against the national hydrological plan. and singing freedom. When I went to sleep, the whole chorus came to me. I recorded it, I ran it, so that I would not forget it. And the next day I started to work on the song of freedom. It was a song that we were never going to record. And it is more, in the first recording we made in Madrid, it is a recording that ends badly because we think that no one has ... Well, this we have recorded to record it, right? And yet it is never censored. A song that made history and that was proposed to be the anthem of Aragon. If they turn it into the anthem of Aragon, then it happens as Asturias Patriarch, We don't sing it anywhere, we've lost it. Sometimes I don't want to sing them and I have to run out because people put it on and the challenge is brutal. We always prepare the end of what we are going to sing and two minutes before we get to the end we start to discuss the stage. We have been told that we are singing this, that we are not singing this. This is from Eduardo, Joaquín Senfada, because he has a more spectacular spirit than Eduardo and I who have said, well, nothing has happened. We have to do it half-heartedly. When we are finishing singing, he says, now whoever buys the album we will dedicate it to him. In Ejea de los Caballeros, when we gave 120 dedicated, I left because I was exhausted. A constant and never abandoned humor. Three decades singing and 20 records published. The creativity of José Antonio La Bordeta is similar in quantity to the one of Auté or the one of Joan Manuel Serrat. He is the most transcendent songwriter, also because he has been the most profound writer. I like the old woman a lot. It is a song I made in 1968. It's like a tenderness towards women from the Sierra del Maestrado. He has opened his way. His songs have been a guide for others, they have changed in a way, but not in essence. And from the jump to the big screen, in 1991 the short character Karambú. I was working very disciplinefully, as for learning the texts and the actions that I had to do, I often asked that this is fine, this is Vanessa, there was the dish of the before, all these words, most were authentic words, some of which we did not repeat, but I think half a can, long and that would be eaten and it could be perfectly at 7 in the afternoon or 8, I do not know, when it finished, it was almost always reference, you will not put the film, A tent barrier that is not here in the support and this retreat at the end I will have to use it but really. The tele arrived, Spain traveled backpack in hand. What made me most satisfied was the country in the backpack. To rent a helicopter, I had no money. Sometimes in a town like Jaraí de la Vera in Extremadura, the mayor told me, I get a helicopter and tomorrow I will give a receipt to the free town. And I had to give a receipt that made me not sing for eight years because I had stopped singing and so on. I was preparing myself for the next stage. I was on TV singing and I was told that it was four years ago. I was told that it was a f**king joke. Now that I'm famous on TV, I'm going to sing too. I'm singing in the 68s. You're deceiving the camera for a short time. It's a very implacable mirror. And the mess transmits truth. That's why it always works. Do what you do. Do the machine, with the breakfast, because it transmits truth. Collaborator of Spanish TV breakfasts. The spectators said, what I was thinking, this man said it in your cake. Above all, it says it in the sense of humor. It's impossible. He has also participated in written press and radio. A store called Gunma La Francesca. The Bordetta, good morning! Good morning! The Inigo and the Bordetta, the Sunday morning, we do the punietas. He promised a tune for the show. The first day he didn't have it, neither the first, nor the second, nor the third, nor the fifth, nor the seventh. And he never finished the song so that José María Inigo could get a little bit of a complaint about the Bordetta, that you don't do anything. I called him Vago. He does well. Now, at this age, he does well being Vago. I love this song, tell us something that has happened to you. Well, nothing, it happened to me that the other day, Wednesday, it was my birthday, I had my two grandchildren here preparing the snack for when suddenly a earthquake came in and they ended up in the hospital. My grandchildren were very sad. I called your grandchildren. Morena told me, Grandma, we have to turn off the 75 candles, we will turn them off any day of this. What are we waiting for? I have told him, Victoria, now I'm going to buy a cake with 75 candles and I'm going to plant the door of his house with the cake so that it can blow in front of me. Have you arrived? Yes, I have arrived, terrible. Don't tell me it's terrible. It's terrible. It's wonderful. With a lot of strength. That's right."

Con este ingrediente vamos a obtener el helado base de yogur al que después le podemos agregar el sirope y el sabor que más queramos o que más nos guste. Lo primero que hacemos es como siempre empezamos montando la nata con el azúcar. Vamos a montar la nata y la vamos a meter en el frío para que no pierda ese frío mientras que seguimos preparando el resto de los ingredientes del helado. Pero vamos por parte. La azúcar, la nata y montamos con varilla eléctrica. Siempre resulta mucho más rápido y más cómodo montarla y una vez que esté montada la guardamos en el frigorífico. En un recipiente ponemos los yogur tipo griego. Vamos a añadir también el azúcar invertido si no tenemos azúcar invertido preparado pues recordar siempre que la miel es un azúcar invertido natural y pudimos agregarlo igualmente. Ponemos la leche y con la batidora eléctrica normal de brazos, la de cuchilla de toda la vida vamos a ligar eso si no lo querías con la batidora lo podría hacer a mano perfectamente simplemente que liga la leche con los yoguris y el azúcar invertido no necesita mucho trabajo y esa mezcla la vamos a ligar con la nata montada que tenemos guardada en el frigorífico para que no pierda el frío la vamos ligando poco a poco con movimientos envolventes para que la nata se nos baje lo menos posible y esa va a ser la mezcla que vamos a utilizar para hacer este lado de yogur esta mezcla vamos a meterla en el frigorífico unas cuatro horas para que esté bien fría la hora de montarla y horífico 4 horas, pues lo único que vamos a hacer es montar la heladera, la heladera la vamos a montar y echar a andar, tiene que estar la heladera andando para agregar la mezcla y vamos ahí volcando la mezcla por el vocal que tiene de apertura la heladera, ahí está la mezcla, la vamos añadiendo a la heladera y esta mezcla va a estar en la heladera mantecando entre 45 minutos y 1 hora es lo que más o menos necesita este lado para mantecarse como bien os he dicho este es un helado base que vamos a utilizar pues para combinarlo con multitud de sabores lo podemos presentar con sirope de chocolate con caramelo líquido con sirope de fresa de frambuesa de vainilla todos los siropes homermeladas que hayan en el mercado la podemos combinar perfectamente con con este lado y y va a estar súper súper rico y ya no solo y tenemos el helado solucionado el coge del lado mínimo tiene que estar un par de horas para que termine de coger esa textura de lado bien conseguido ahora mi total cuar se puede comer pero es un helado que va a estar muy tierno va a estar tipo mus, frío, rico, pero tipo mus si queremos el cuerpo del lado helado lo mantenemos dos horas en el coge del lado y ya tendremos el helado perfectamente yo este helado lo he presentado de chocolate para que veáis una manera de presentarlo pero como ya os he dicho una vez que tengamos la bola en el recipiente lo podemos acompañar con fruta, con mermelada, con sirope y ya imaginación al poder.

For this we will need 200 ml of cream, 3 yogurt, 150 ml of milk, 100 g of sugar and 50 g of inverted sugar. With this ingredient we will obtain the yogurt base ice cream, which we can then add the syrup and the flavor that we want the most. The first thing we do is as always we start by mounting the cream with the sugar. and we are going to put it in the fridge so that it does not lose that cold while we continue to prepare the rest of the ingredients from the ice cream but we go on the side sugar, the cream and we set it with electric rod, it will always be much faster and more comfortable to set it and once it is set we save it in the fridge in a container we put the Greek yogurt we are going to add also inverted sugar if we do not have inverted sugar prepared, then always remember that honey is a natural inverted sugar and we can add it equally. We put the milk and with the electric mixer normal arm, the knife of all life, we are going to link that if you do not want it with the mixer, you could do it by hand perfectly, simply that you link the milk with the yogurt and inverted sugar does not need much work and we will mix it with the cream that we have stored in the fridge so that it does not lose the cold we will mix it little by little with involving movements so that the cream is less likely to go down and that is the mixture that we are going to use to make this side of yogurt this mixture we are going to put it in the fridge for about 4 hours so that it is very cold when it is in the fridge 4 hours because the only thing we are going to do is to mount the ice cream the ice cream we are going to mount and it is to go it has to be the ice cream going to add the mixture and we are going to wrap the mixture through the mouth that has the ice cream opening there is the mixture we are going to add the ice cream and this mixture will be enough in the ice cream to keep between 45 minutes and an hour This is what you need to keep it cold. As I said, this is a base ice cream that we are going to use to combine it with a variety of flavors. We can present it with chocolate syrup, with liquid caramel, strawberry syrup, vanilla, all the jam syrup that you have in the market, we can combine it perfectly with this ice cream. And it's going to be super delicious. We have a wide range of syrup. We have the solution. The frozen one needs a couple of hours to finish the texture of the ice cream. Now it's ready, but it's a very soft ice cream. It's very cold, rich, but very soft. If you want the ice cream, keep it in the freezer for 2 hours and you'll have the ice cream perfectly. I'm going to use chocolate syrup to show you how to make it. But as I told you, once you have the bowl in the fridge, you can use it with fruit, jam, syrup, and imagination. Very simple, very tasty and I hope you enjoy it."

Offshore wind parks are a main pillar of Germany's energy revolution, but doubts are already being cast on the feasibility of the plans. Power companies say they can't feed any more offshore electricity into the national grid. And politicians say opposition in coastal areas is growing.

The Greens and conservation groups don't want offshore building in summer between April and October. But that's the only time the weather is relatively calm. You can't put up wind turbines in autumn or winter. There's a whole host of problems that need tackling. Germany wants out of nuclear energy and fast.

At the same time, they don't want solar panels, wind turbines, high-voltage power lines or biogas plants in their backyards. If I want renewable energy free from CO2 emissions and no nuclear power, I have to live with the consequences. So I have to accept that new power lines will be built, that storage facilities will be built, that wind turbines might spoil my view and that there will be biogas facilities that don't smell particularly nice. I have to accept that these things are going to happen. Until now, Germany has generated just over 40% of its energy from coal, around 20% from nuclear. Natural gas has the third biggest share. Renewables are fourth with 17%. But the energy mix is set to change radically. By 2050, the aim is to generate 80% from renewables and the rest from natural gas. Currently, nuclear reactors deliver more than a fifth of Germany's electricity needs. without producing CO2 emissions. But the last of them will be taken offline in 11 years time. Doubts are growing that renewables can fill the void. Initially we're going to need more coal. We've got coal-fired power stations. There's enough capacity, but there aren't very efficient power plants. We have to be frank about that. They emit more CO2. And it's very doubtful we'll be able to achieve our CO2 reduction. targets in the way we'd planned to. We don't have to go with coal. We have to avoid coal, because that's the problem. If we expand coal, we'll have a massive problem with our climate change goals. We won't achieve them, so we have to make sure we focus on emissions-free and low-emissions technology. And in terms of fossil fuels, that means natural gas is clearly one of the main priorities. Nuclear power is heading for the history books in Germany. Coal could fill the gap in the meantime, but that would mean sacrificing emissions targets. The road to renewables will be a long and difficult one.","A glimpse of the future.

Então quando o câncer de próstata é diagnosticado e esse diagnóstico é sempre feito com base numa biópsia, existem alguns parâmetros que determinam qual é o tratamento ideal para esse doente. Primeiro deles é a extensão da doença, então se a doença já está à distância ou não, se ela é metastático ou não. Isso pode ser feito em algumas situações através da realização de cintilografia óssea de alguns exames de sangue. existe aí suspeita de estravazamento extra capsular ou estravazamento extra prostático da doença. Além disso, o patologista dá uma nota para a biopsia, é chamada de Gord glissom e o glissom quanto mais alta ele indica o maior grau de agressividade, quanto mais baixo ele indica o menor grau de agressividade da doença. E por último, o terceiro parâmetro utilizado no processo do acisório é o próprio nível do PSA no sangue. E com base nesses três parâmetros a gente classifica doença em alto risco, risco intermediário e baixo, onde o alto risco significa que existe uma alta probabilidade, uma probabilidade bastante elevada de que exista doença à distância, mesmo que eu não tenha ainda documentado essa doença à distância. O risco intermediário, como o próprio nome diz, tem um risco intermediário, baixo risco, tem uma baixa probabilidade e que exista doença à distância. Para a doença de risco intermediário e risco alto, obviamente que se a gente não fizer nada, a doença vai progredir de maneira relativamente rápido ao longo de alguns anos e isso muito provavelmente vai ser um fator limitante na vida do doente, a não ser que se trate de um doente já extremamente velho ou com muitas outras doenças que poderiam ser fatores limitantes para a sua sobrevida. Já para pacientes que têm uma doença de baixo risco, existem aí as opções tanto de tratamento imediato curativo quanto a conduta que a gente chama de expectante ou de segmento ativo onde o médico acompanha seriadamente com níveis de PSA, repete a biópsia dentro de um ano para ver se existe alguma manifestação de que esse câncer esteja se tornando um pouco mais agressivo caso no qual seria indicado então um tratamento. E quando a gente fala de tratamento do câncer de próstata, existem basicamente duas modalidades curativas para o tratamento do câncer de próstata. A primeira delas é a própria cirurgia com a retirada da glúndula prostáctica, chamada prostatectomia. E a segunda modalidade é a radioterapia. A radioterapia é esta que pode ser tanto feita de maneira externa, chamada teleterapia, quanto por braque terapia através do implante de sementes radioativas. Sementes radioativas são utilizadas em situações muito restritas, mas a radioterapia externa ela muito provavelmente é equivalente em eficácia a uma cirurgia que retire a próstata, chamada prostatectomia. E o que determina se um tratamento ou outro deve ser empregado na tentativa de cura de um paciente é a questão sobre a disponibilidade de um bom equipamento de radioterapia ou a disponibilidade de um bom urologista para proceder com a cirurgia. No caso das duas modalidades terapêuticas estarem disponíveis realmente não existem dados que permitam dizer que uma seja superior à outra e nesse caso tem que haver uma discussão aberta entre todos os médicos e o paciente em algumas situações quando se trata de tumores um pouco mais agressivos e se opta por uma radioterapia essa radioterapia é suplementada por um período aí de seis meses a três anos de castração ou de manipulação hormonal. realmente a chance de curar um paciente com câncer de próstata é bastante elevada, no entanto existem obviamente os efeitos colaterais desse tratamento que devem ser discutidos abertamente entre o paciente e os seus médicos.","Who is talking to you is Rafael Calix, I am a clinical oncologist and scientific director of the University of Hong Kong and we will now talk a little about the treatment of prostate cancer. So when prostate cancer is diagnosed and this diagnosis is always done with a biopsy basis, there are some parameters that determine what is the ideal treatment for this disease. The first of them is the extension of the disease, so If the disease is at a distance, it can be done in some situations through the oceal scintillography of blood tests. there is a suspension of extra capsular or prostaticus extracastation of the disease. In addition, the pathologist gives a note to the biopsy called Gordon Gleason and Gleason, the higher the greater the degree of aggressiveness, the lower the degree of aggressiveness of the disease. And finally, the third parameter used in the cesorium process is the blood pressure level. And based on these three parameters we classify disease in high risk, low risk intermediate risk, where high risk means that there is high probability, a high probability that there is a distance disease even if I do not have yet documented this distance disease. The intermediate risk as the name itself says has an intermediate risk, low risk, has a low probability that there is a distance disease. For the high risk-due disease, if we don't do anything, the disease will progress relatively quickly over the years and this will probably be a limiting factor in the life of the disease, unless it is already extremely old or with many other diseases that could be limiting factors for your survival. treatment The second change is the radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is this one that can be done both externally, called teletherapy, and for brachytherapy through the implant of radioactive seeds. Radioactive seeds are used in very restricted situations, but the radiotherapy is the one that is used in very restricted situations. The external radiotherapy is very likely to be equivalent to a surgery that removes the prostate, called prostatectomy. And what determines if one treatment or another should be done in the treatment of a patient is the question about the availability of a good equipment of radiotherapy or the availability of a good urologist to proceed with the surgery. In the case of the two therapeutic modalities available, There are no data that allow one to be superior to another. In this case, there must be an open discussion between all doctors and the patient. In some situations, when it comes to a more aggressive tumor, and it is chosen by a radiotherapy, this radiotherapy is supplemented by a period of 6 months to 3 years of castration or hormonal manipulation. treatment, really the chance to cure a patient with prostate cancer is quite high, however, there are obviously the side effects of this treatment that should be discussed openly between the patient and his doctors."

So it just fixed that. Added item frames. So you can put like a diamond sword into a frame and then you can just have it hang there. And then it added anvils. The anvils were really, really helpful. This is probably one of the biggest things that happened in this update. What you can do is you place it and then what you can do is you can repaint your items and you can also rename it and enchant it, I'm pretty sure. walls. I'm not too fond of what that is just because it just came out two days ago. I haven't been able to cover everything. So you're gonna have to find that out for yourself. But I'm pretty sure it's just like generated cobblestone walls. It might be for villages. Add in pumpkin pies. And if you don't know what a pumpkin pie is, it's just pumpkin put in a pie and it's in Minecraft now. So you can eat it. It's fun to eat, not to play. I added carrots and potatoes. Potatoes, food, carrots, food. So now you can eat it in Minecraft. Carrots can be put on a stick to control pigs while riding. So now you can control pigs while you're riding. It's pretty self-explanatory. Added a new boss mob. So that is the wither. That's the new nether boss. So it's kind of like the ender dragon of the nether. So yeah. It added witches. Which is we'll throw like negative potions at you. I don't I'm not sure which ones they are and They'll try and kill you so it's almost like a new type of mob added bats bats We all know what bats are they fly around and yeah Added mob heads that can be placed. They're kind of like They're not really the full size of blocks, but they're just like a little bit smaller and you can place them also self-explanatory This is probably one of the coolest things in this update. Zombies can go up to a villager and infect them almost as they do to us, but they kill us. I'm pretty sure you can just go up to them and cure them with an item. Added button buttons. That's pretty cool. As we all know, there were stone buttons, which we used for redstone and stuff. But now there wouldn't. You can also use button buttons. So items can be cloned with the pick block action in creative mode. I've always wondered what the pick block thing was. But right now it's, now you can clone items. Items can be quickly moved to the hotbar by pressing 1-9 while hovering an item. So say this is your creative, say that's your creative box right here. If that was like a diamond sword you could like hover over it and press 1 to 9 and it would put it into your inventory hotbar. Added slash difficulty slash spawn point slash weather slash game rule and slash clear commands. So slash difficulty I'm sure you can just do slash difficulty peaceful or hard or I don't know if hardcore is in there but As you can see it you can change the difficulty slash bond point I think you can just change where this bond point is and then you can put it to a pair of coordinates and then slash weather you can put slash weather rain slash weather snow I don't know whatever you can think of slash game rule which is like fire spreads in a couple other things and Clear command so if you had all of these on and you did slash clear command Added target selectors for commands back and their capes added option to toggle vertical cinch. I think that's in the video settings enable v-sync but I'm not sure what that is at the moment. Like I said I'll probably do a video capping all of this. Added customization to Super Flat Worlds. I had the pre-release for like three weeks and it covered most of this but I think I think there was some stuff that was added at the last minute. And that was one of the things that was cool. So what you can do is you can go into your, you can press Super Flat, press Edit, and then you can change what the top block is. You can make it obsidian. And there's a lot of presets. I'll be sure to put that into my other video. Minor additions to the World Generator. I don't think those are actually, you can actually see those new potion You can make new potions. Leather armor can be dyed. That's also pretty cool. So what you can do is you can take pink dye and you can dye your leather armor pink. And there's also some new graphics for the leather armor so that's cool too. And the maps start more zoomed in and can be extended. So as most of us know you can have a map of Minecraft to see where you're going. And now they just start zoomed in and can be extended. can now be set into a locked position. That's pretty self explanatory just because they're locked and the new sound effects just like for the anvil and a couple other things. I'm sure there are a lot of people who won't like those, but I'm not sure. And portals to the nether can now transport items and mobs. I did not know that until now. That is really cool. And adventure mode now allows placing and removing I used to go into Adventure mode, like do slash game mode 3 I'm pretty sure. I'll be sure to check on that. And I used to be like, oh, that's what it is. And I'd stop playing. So yeah, changed method of playing sideways with logs. I used to always hate that. I still hate it. And the improved server list. Now they have a new server list. You can have some better details on the server and how many people are on it. It used to have that but it has a more descriptive version of that now. Improve the debug F3 options. You can press F3 and then you can find your seed, your FPS, fran supermint if you don't know what that means. And spawn protection is now automatically disabled There are no defined admins. So if you're on a server or if you have your own server and you have no admins then there will be no protection. So make sure to have an admin on your server if you want some protection. And the last and the best removed here, Brian. It said that on all updates. I'm pretty sure except for the bug fixes and the smaller updates. That is not an update. 1.3.2 is just a couple bugs. 1.3.1 it does say removed hero brine over here and yeah it just this one doesn't because it's a smaller update again yeah but anyways like okay I'm just going to 1.4.2 like I said I I will be making a new video. It may not be today. It'll probably be sometime in this week. I will do a video in Minecraft that just does this, but it's actually in the game.

It's actually even from the Xbox and I'm hating to say it, but it seems like Xbox Even though you had to pay for it is the way to go I've noticed from the past week Or at least since the patch and update that I'm constantly getting kicked out of PlayStation lobbies games getting connected Interrupted out but yet I have 50 down 10 up connection. So I mean I shouldn't have any problem being connected It rarely actually I don't think it's ever happened to me on Xbox yet. So is it worth the seven bucks a month to Not be getting booted from lobbies and Have gameplays that doesn't lag somewhat. I will have to say that you Xbox guys Have it lucky to have been playing it this long and be used to it If you all want to go to PlayStation 3, you all would have a fit. I mean it just it playing simply it freaking blows. I mean There's no comparison to the connection. There is one thing that Xbox has that is worse than PlayStation is the lag comp It happens a lot on PlayStation But it does happen to me more on Xbox I guess it's due because of my good connection I could be you know two foot around a corner and I get shot I guess that is the nature of the beast and I guess none of us really care enough to boycott this shit to Try to make a difference. So I guess we're just kind of stuck with it Kind of like with all these boosters, you know Nothing we can do about it. I said put video after video out about them you think they'll ever delete the tactical insert probably not I mean they don't even allow them in a lot of your tournaments I don't think you know so why even have it in the game I mean what's the point unless you're throwing it out there for these little kids that can and we'll use them for that you know who you know who cares hello let's talk about this gameplay I know it's with a peacekeeper and But everybody and they freaking mama runs a peacekeeper anymore, and you cannot beat the damn thing unless you're using one I'm just not godly like Kaiser and you know Shrek and everybody else that I see running around type 25 and and just beasting on people with it I don't know if it's me or you know if it's a placebo effect of me not thinking that it's a better gun This calls me to want to use it more. I used to be a stickler for the MSMC. I love that gun it on PlayStation side it was one of my favorite guns until the peacekeeper come out and then the peacekeeper came out and I used it a little bit and I didn't like the way it played I didn't like the way it turned I didn't like the way it aimed and then I guess they buffed it or changed it up a little bit and then after that it was Shit, it was the go-to gun it had range like a AR and it freakin would spin around like a Like an SMG with a stock on it without a stop so I mean why not use it? Run different perks that allow them to pull up faster. I mean there's a million different ways a person can go about playing his game and Me personally I paid for it. I'll play it how I want to play it I mean I do like challenges and I do like using other guns and stuff like that So I would always use the peacekeeper But when I get in a lobby and somebody says you want to use the peacekeeper the whole game So it doesn't really count. Why does it not fucking count? My stats shows that it counted it raised my KD or give me an extra swarm so why the hell does it not count? It does count. So get over it. I can't tell you how many times that I've told somebody to pick a gun and I'll use it and I'll drop a swarm on them the next game. And then they back out halfway through the game after I get the swarm because they don't want to hear me tell them that they was full of shit. But anyways, I guess that's enough rambling on for the night. I should have like three or four. Actually I think I have like six videos uploaded and they'll be coming out next one a day or something like that and then I'll have one probably next four. week after with some big news about my channel.

De apenas um lado, do lado dos paradaísseis e dos brasileiros. Mas especificamente dos produtores rurais desse nosso estado. Hoje uma notícia dos jornais nos aflige que é justamente o embarco da Ucrânia a nossa cara. Mais um país que passa a não comprar mais os produtos brasileiros a carne brasileira afetando especificamente o setor de suinos que no nosso estado representa grande parte da nossa economia. O Ocrânio é o terceiro maior mercado de exportações de suinos que o Brasil tem, que 40 mil toneladas a ano de carne suina são exportadas do Brasil como Ocrânio. No dia 15 de junho passado entrou em vigor o embarco da Rússia a carne brasileira, um embarco que para esses mercados que fazem grande parte do consumo da carne fluida brasileira. Muitos especialistas têm dito que isso é resultado de uma queda de braço entre a Rússia e o Cânia com o Brasil devido à entrada desses países na organização mundial de comércio. Agora não se pode admitir que os produtores mais, as economias e diversos estados sendo afetados devido a uma queda de braço por uma briga estritamente comercial em que momento algum se justifica sanitariamente, ou seja, em momento algum se justifica por problemas de quebra-filosa, de doenças, ou que a nossa carga não teria a seridade necessária para chegar naquele país. Pelo contrário, nosso Estado especificamente tem feito todos os esforços para que Paraná se torne, continue a área livre de afilosa com vacinação e que a nossa carga possa ser vendida para os países como o povo. e a Rússia e a Ucrânia que são nossos maiores importadores. Hoje o Ministério da Agricultura anunciou uma missão para a África do Sul que desde 2005 embargou o consumo a compra de carne suína brasileira. Essa missão tem pro objetivo retomar aquele mercado e fazer com que a África do Sul volte a comprar carne brasileira e também sirva de exemplo para diversos outros países que ainda continuam do embargo da Febra Filosa em 2005. O Ministério da Agricultura infelizmente perdeu a oportunidade de responder rapidamente aos questionamentos dos consumidores russos que enviaram os nossos produtores diversos, diversas questões sobre a senidade, sobre a produção, a homologação dos frigoríficos, como estaria sendo produzido essa carne, como seria o procedimento de debate, justamente tentando justificar que é da liberação comercial que está ocorrendo entre o Brasil e o rosto, e é devido ao IMC. O dia de ontem o Ministério da Agricultura enviou essas respostas de um embargo que passou a tomar efeito dia 15 de junho, ou seja, infelizmente e tardiamente que já prejudica toda a produção suída do nosso estado para dar, principalmente por ser um dos maiores produtores do Brasil, terceiro produtor de nosso país, e ter na Ucrânia e na Rosto o nosso maior mercado consumidor. Devido a esse embargo, a sepulência para dar e volta a repetir principalmente os 135 mil produtores de Suíduos do Estado não sejam prejudicados por uma grama briga muito maior que é a questão da organização mundial de começo.","In a heated debate day, we will talk about a subject that is not there, it is just one side of the Paranáes and of the Brazilians, but specifically of the local producers in our state. Today, news from the newspapers is about the embargo of Ukraine to our country, another country that is not buying more Brazilian products, The Brazilian meat is affected by the soy sector, which in our state represents the major part of our economy. Ukraine is the third largest export market of soy that Brazil has. 40,000 tons of soy are exported from Brazil to Ukraine. On June 15, last year, the Russian Embargo entered the Brazilian meat. specifically to the states of Matugroz do Sul, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. Today, this news of the embargo of Ukraine also affects our health care workers who represent 5 million heads of the health care workers in Brazil, 15.5% of the national health care produced here in the state and especially 135,000 health care workers who dedicate themselves to health care workers who are directly affected We had a problem with Russia, 85 discredential frigorifics. Only one frigorific in the three states, the South and South Korea, continued to sell the Swiss meat for that country. The deputies of the Russian state know very well that 135,000 Swiss producers in that state, a large number of farmers, people who depend on this income, especially those of their cooperatives, can sell this product. for these markets that make a large part of the consumption of Brazilian meat. Many specialists have said that this is a result of a fall in the arm between Russia and Ukraine with Brazil, due to the entry of this country in the World Trade Organization. Now you can not deny that the foreign producers, economies and several states are affected due to a fall in the arm for a strictly commercial fight, and for a moment that will be justified sanitary. In other words, for a moment that will be justified by problems of health, of diseases, or that our government would not have the sincerity necessary to reach that country. On the contrary, our state, specifically, has made all efforts to prepare the country, continues the free and health area with vaccination, and that our government can be sold to the countries as a public The Ministry of Agriculture announced a mission to South Africa, which since 2005 has embarked on the purchase of the Swiss card in Brazil. This mission aims to resume that market and make South Africa return to buy Brazilian cards and also serve as an example for several countries that are still on the boat, The Ministry of Agriculture unfortunately lost the opportunity to answer quickly the questions of the Russian consumers who sent our producers several questions about the production of the figurine amulet, how would this meat be produced and how would the procedure be debated, precisely trying to justify this The day of yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture gave its response. Of the embargo that passed to take effect on June 15. That is, unfortunately, later, which already damages all the Swedish production of our state to give, mainly because of the largest producers of Brazil, third producer of our country, and having in the country of Russia our largest consumer market. Due to this embargo, the assembly of the city of Brazil has been in a very difficult position. President of the CERTA Catarina, today is doing a public audience with several entities, several producers, to debate this problem and try to find solutions so that European countries can consume our Swiss meat, mainly. Talking with Deputy Ermas Brando Junho, the president of our Agriculture Commission, Deputy Luciana Rafael, President of the family agriculture block, and this Deputy President of the Agropecuário Block, We must also make a public hearing here in the State of Paraguay. Hear our producers, hear the class entities, hear the workers of the city, hear our federal deputies, members of the agriculture bank, our senators, all the technical body of the agriculture secretary, all the state organs responsible for this sector, so that the people here in the legislative assembly can try to find the solution too. And, again, especially the 135,000 producers of the United States, don't be affected by a much bigger fight, which is the issue of the World Cup Organization."

In the cover, it is not here now, because it is here. In the cover it has an instrument called Trompa Marina. It is an instrument of the half-birth. It is an instrument that is hollow, normally it is a single string, in that case there are two, one and its eighth. This is the history of Western music, we started it. I am talking a little bit of aesthetic, The criteria of beauty in the West is... What is atonal or polytonal is not beautiful, I have said that. Schoenberg's work was the first one, with a line of grace, to say that the insolences are not such, they are only harmonic and non-theft. We'll see it in this one. This is a painting by the French musicologist, but Schoenberg also studied these thesis, and he said that he was talking about this as well. That is, that until the 9th century no one was able to do it, not even the old ones. This is what the story of Castilian translated is about. It is not what is being said in the extangels at this time. But it does not matter. In the old ones they only sang in the United States. Let's leave it there. Let's assume that this was the truth. Let's see what happens in the West from the Middle Ages. That is, so that they understand how the Western ear is following the nature very closely. The church prohibits the art that is prosplitted, it can only be painted in biblical images, only artistic works are made to greater glory of God. The act of the church as a Roman church is still being carried out. Only the song authorizes Unison. We are talking about the first centuries of the Aurelia, before the year 1000, after the year 2000. In the last moment the church only authorized the song to Unison. When the church falls, it is possible that it does not exist. But talking about the generations, this is the history of music, we can not try in any place. We are talking about the first times of the war, the organ, The Church of St. John is the first to be held in the Church of St. John. and authorizes the same in parallel singing, that is, there are half-day of rehearsals in the first ones. The first ones were on a different note. The second ones that were authorized were progressions in parallel to the distance of the eighth. Then I raise my audition and authorize the singing in parallel, I was going to start with some points in this one, but we are already before the eighth. I also authorize the singing in parallel to the distance of the fifth. And then I continue to spend time and also authorize the singing in parallel to the distance of the fourth. That is, I am assuming that this What has been an occidental ear since the 6th century? What has happened in the West? The development and the development of the show, many views, well, not views, but strange intervals, such as these, and other things, are already admitted in 1500, always accompanied by a text sufficiently ... understand what I'm saying? That is, up to 1900, even if you give the romanticism, even if you want it like that, romanticism is already the exploration of the tonal aspect, even the edge. Strauss comes and enters when he wants, he dies half a century, 20, he is the last romantic, Then, what do the Maguarhas do? They continue to exploit the Micropones. This is what is observed in the accident and we will say something else at the moment. They are following, the fifths, these things have nothing to do with evil. But there are certain times when they are asked to do some fifths containing Triton, which is the devil's interval. But what does the fifths have to do with evil? Nothing, in harmony, these things are forced to be done. That's what the word means. Regulations for the conduction of the voices. They are trying to train them to know how to handle them. They are forbidden to do these movements, but when they are compositional they do what they want. They will do whatever they want. They will do this, the counter-work, two octaves below, there are octaves parallel, there are five octaves, and nothing happens. That is, while they are teaching harmony, they are trying to digest that they do not die and that they learn how to handle them, but they do not know. That's not composition. I don't know why they say that. You want to compose in harmony. When you arrive at my workshop, you want to paint the ruins. But it can't be. The fifths and the fourths, and other things, have nothing bad about it. No dissonance, no strange interval that any culture has anything bad about it, in my view. Except the descriptions of sacerdotes and other things that come from the diadem of the state. Let's listen to the fifths, for example. They are fifths. and some will say, of course, it is a metallic one. It is hard. It is an integral that the classical church was considered one of the greatest consonants. In the classical church we see diatonic systems, like ours, and other strange ones that the church has not yet passed, but that we have managed to recover. More or less they sell the diatonic, right? Yes, I follow. These represent a very... The Changnaga have a pair of forms in the first two pages of the new history that speaks of these things. For some reason we do not know very well because in distant points of the globe there are certain few cultures that are counted as singing in perfect fifths, in pure fifths. This is a theory, and the middle and upper half were also songs in progressions of fifths, very hard, that sound to some or others. For example, in the French song, now I can hear it in the middle. between the Russian and Russian Kosakos, they are a southern town, the old Russia, normally persecuted and enslaved by the Russian, and when they go to the documentary before they are aesthetic, some of them, some of them, they go out in the Chechen, that's very simple, there are many more complex things than the ones in the south. Between the Kosakos, in some points of the French camp, among the Shangrara, in the Middle East, and some more, I don't remember, They sing in fifths, for example, Chinese novices, too. When they are started to sing, some go backwards. My people would say, that's a bad guy, they don't know music.

I want to see durian I'm not 100% sure on that And it says lemon and plus that mystery fruit equals Romany or some soda flavor on the back you'll see there's kind of a I would say metal or something, I'm not 100% sure either. There's probably different flavors, I'm not sure. But like I said, it's probably some gummy center or something, I'm not 100% sure. So yeah, hopefully any of you guys know what that means. And on the back, I guess it's just like the calories and stuff like that, the nutritional facts. So that's pretty much it that's on the back and the front. So let's try it out. I'm also getting hopefully I'm sorry about talking but here's the candy itself. As you can see there's something in the middle. I'm not even sure what that's supposed to be. I'm all getting it in my mind. From the other side of the view or something else. Well I'm actually near sighting so I couldn't see. So right here you see a boy and some hearts. On the other side you'll see a girl. And that's pretty much it. Itadakimasu. That means bon appetit in Japan. Or Japanese I mean. Alright so. This is pretty much tasted the first time. It tastes pretty much like a different form of the flavor of the lemon. Let's try both because you try both and they'll make a different kind of flavor. So let's try it out There's no different flavor like it just pretty much tastes like a lemon lemon soda or will not really lemon So it's like lemonade or something like that Not too strong lemonade, but just lemon or official lemon flavor. So that's pretty much it I give this a two out of five Just for effort. I'm not sure what that tastes inside. I'm not gonna break it in just go Hulk on this candy and just I'm just going to break it apart and see what's inside. I read it 2 out of 5. As you can see there's this stick. It's just like a plastic stick. But it's not the cheap paper kind and won't break easy. So that's a plus actually. Thanks for watching guys and I'll catch you guys later. It peeled away the plastic and let's take a taste test on the bubblegum itself. It's really chalky from the outside to the exterior. Oh exterior. So let's take a taste test. Okay, well the bubblegum is pretty much bland. Before it did actually lose flavor like a minute or two later after you start chewing it. Not that much flavor. It's pretty much like eating, well not eating just like chewing some sugar. That's pretty much what it tastes like. for this. If they mess up on your order they'll send you something back or you know stuff like that they'll throw in a bonus pretty much so that's pretty much it.

So we'll see what he comes out here and delivers. I think he's probably going to talk about economic pressures on the middle class. He's going to talk a lot about lower taxes and how you don't raise taxes, period, when the country is in trouble economically. And he's going to try and polish off that Maverick brand that Obama's been trying to steal for a year or two, and talk about change out here and making it actually happen, as Palin did last night.

It's raining too. Yes, you can wear a sweater. Yes, you can. So it's hard to get sick today. And now it's raining outside, some kind of sickness. Yes, there's a hail, so you saw it for the first time, it's really crazy cold all the time. And it's raining, but it's not raining because you have a raincoat. So we've been out in the canoe again today. And then you changed your clothes, it was a shock And then I made a lab shoes for lunch And then I made a toy for dinner So the older ones were pretty good, I understand that it's shiny I know that camping is so smart, actually But you managed to do it? I did it, yes I didn't manage to do it, but it was a good idea Yes, it was a little bit, but you don't have to force yourself I'm so bad at this, she saw you on the phone. I tried but... it was bad. I hope you don't get anything wrong. You wake up at half an hour, but you wake up. Is it light? No, it's dark. Okay, let's sleep. I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm the same. And I'm doing good, but I didn't know that I did it. I think I was the only one who woke up. Yes, so I'm the same, I woke up at different times. And I don't know if it's right, but it's actually 8 in the afternoon. So we were so tired and then we let them sleep once. Even if they made you too big, but I let them sleep. I was happy. Let them sleep at least once in the sleep. And then I said, we have to sleep now, because they don't let us sleep. And then we slept. So we slept. We took about 10 of them, because we had to have a mobile on AVT. So I was sleeping at the clock and I slept for a while. So it's a bit of a lunch break. I don't know why it's always like that. And we're going to Aarel with the whole thing. God, I'm not sure if I can go all alone in the dark. Yes, it's fine. But it's a bit scary to go to the toilet because it's all night. All night."

Why did you want to get involved in this project? Well, I think any kind of charity is a good kind of thing, you know, and you've got to just push it out there and just do it for the best. And I think basically if I can, you know, do something to help the situation, then for me that's something worthwhile. I was looking at your shoes earlier and you said to me off the camera that you actually do something with Barbies back in the day. I used to run a stall in Camden called the Dead Barbies stall and basically I just defecate Barbies and put them in Barbie boxes and then sell them to people for £10. I get them from Poundstretcher. For a pound? For a pound! So I get like 20 Barbies, 20 Pound, I go home and get the flamethrower out. We melt them a bit, we stick their hands in their heads, make them look really scary or whatever. We have loads of different kinds of Barbies, we have pregnant Barbies, all sorts of stuff. And then Siamese Twins Barbie and things like that. There's loads of really weird things, fun things. But it's all fun. And then I take them, put them back in their boxes, all messed up. And then I put them on the stall. How long did you do that? I think you should be scared of anything, you know what I mean? So I think really with this, I think there's nothing to be scared about. I think you just got to, you know, I've just basically all I'm doing is I'm just singing, you know, I'm just I'm gonna go and sing. It's like I'm not the one that actually has cancer that has to deal with that. So I'm not scared, you know, I've only got to sing, you know, it's people people that have cancer and stuff. They have a lot more problems. They've got to deal with it. But you know, there's no point of being scared in any sense. You just got to kind of get on with it really.

Los ingenieros y arquitectos encargados de la construcción supervisaron los primeros movimientos de tierra donde se ubicará la primera torre de apartamentos que estará lista en enero de 2013. Estamos iniciando el proyecto que se está convirtiendo en realidad un sueño que se sintió desde que llegamos a la finca por primera vez y encontramos un ambiente lleno de árboles, aves y fauna que nos hizo pensar diferente. El proyecto desde ese momento surgió con una serie de requisitos, requerimientos y dificultades por la distribución de los árboles en el lugar. Se buscó una implantación de los edificios de tal manera que ocuparan los espacios más libres del terreno. En la inspección, el director de la Escuela de Ciencias Ambientales, acompañado por el coordinador del Vivero Forestal de la Universidad de la Universidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad de la Unidad y especialistas en los campos forestal y de calidad del aire. Los expertos concluyeron que hay excelentes condiciones para la reforestación. Además de un buen suelo, los expertos de la UNA encontraron en el terreno de Bosque Descazú una especie de árbol muy escasa. El mes de la terminación de las semillas es muy, muy baja, entonces este árbol es muy difícil encontrarlo. Acá lo encontramos y lo encontramos con frutos. Es un gran aporte muy, muy importante para el que le da mucho valor a esta área, conservarlo. Los especialistas de la UNA también plantearon la importancia de que Bosques de Escazú forme parte de una especie de corredor biológico en esta zona. Para ellos se tendrán que cortar algunos muchos de estos árboles tal vez tengan que eliminarse, tal vez algunos que son no nativos pero que van a ser sustituidos por otros que si son nativos o que no son nativos pero son naturalizados y que no representan ningún problema. La idea es que estos árboles provean la mayor cantidad de ornamentos que hay en el mundo. y que además de eso atraigan tanto aves como mamíferos pequeños y que pues mejoren la biodiversidad como tal en este lugar. En la parte constructiva, los ingenieros de bosques de Eskazú también están tomando medidas ambientales para cumplir con los estándares ecológicos del proyecto. Nosotros contamos con una empresa asesora, con una ingeniera que nos acompañaba en todo el proceso, en donde ella le encargaba de ir nos dictando a nosotros todas las medidas que tenemos que ir tomando, de rotulación, medidas de trasiego materiales, de caminos, de accesos, de pantallas para cubrir de polvo, de las vagonesas cuando salen no pueden salir sucias, tienen que salir cerradas, tienen que haber siempre gente que nos esté ayudando en la calle en la limpieza. Con estas y otras muchas características ambientales, Bosque del Escazú está decidido a convertirse en un proyecto demostrativo para el país, demostrando que los proyectos ecológicos sí tienen factibilidad económica. Vamos a demostrar que si se puede hacer un proyecto verde, un proyecto sostenible, sin tener un mucho costo extra que se tenga que trasladar al comprador final o que vaya a doler al bolsillo de los costalicenses, sino que con un poquito de investigación, con un poquito más de trabajo se pueden hacer cosas sostenibles y ayudar a mantener el bloco verde del país. dar asseguimiento a este proceso y se pretende que muchas de las tecnologías y medidas que está aplicando bosques de escasú sean copiadas por otros proyectos en el país.","On March 15, the works of the project Bosques de Escazú were started, the first experience of ecological pollution in Costa Rica and of repostation in an urban area. The engineers and architects in charge of the construction supervised the first ground movements where the first apartment tower will be located, which will be ready in January 2013. We are starting the project that is actually becoming a dream, which felt since we arrived at the farm for the first time. and we found a place full of trees, birds and fauna that made us think differently. The project, from that moment, emerged with a series of requirements, requirements and difficulties for the distribution of trees in the place. A implementation of the buildings was sought in such a way that the most free spaces of the land were occupied. The school of environmental sciences, accompanied by the coordinator of the forest vivarium of the University of California, will be the head of the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, the school of environmental sciences, and specialists in the forest areas and air quality. Experts concluded that there are excellent conditions for reforestation. In addition to a good soil, the UN experts found in the forest of Escazu a kind of very scarce tree. We have a very interesting tree, which is called Cedru Real, it is the Cedrella Salvadorensis. It is a very scarce tree, whose roots are very small, and it is very difficult to find. The specialists of the UNA also raised the importance that the forest of Eskazú is part of a kind of biological corridor in this area. For them, they will have to cut some of the branches of the forest. Many of these trees may have to be eliminated, some may not be native, but they will be replaced by others that are native or that are not native but are naturalized and that represent no problem. The idea is that these trees provide the majority of ornamental trees that are native. In the construction part, the forest engineers from Eskazú are also taking environmental measures to meet the ecological standards of the project. of irrigation, measures of material storage, roads, accesses, screens to cover dust, the vans when they come out they cannot go out dirty, they have to go out clean, there has to be always people who are helping us on the street in cleaning. With these and many other environmental characteristics, Bosque del Cazú is decided to become a demonstrative project for the country, demonstrating that ecological projects do have economic effectiveness. We are going to show that if it can be a sustainable green project without having a lot of extra costs that have to be transferred to the final buyer or that it will hurt the pocket of the costaricenses, but with a little research, with a little more work, sustainable things can be done and help maintain the green bloc of the country. will follow this process and it is expected that many of the technologies and measures that are applying to the forest in Skazoo are copied by other projects in the country."

Тем более организации с таким неблагозвучным для русского ухообревиatorio как бгич. Мы пригласили сюда 100 человек. Мы готовы бы предоставить им любые возможности для работы. Им сто мало, им нужно приехать за год сюда или за сколько, за три недели или за сколько. Это их хотелки все. Они в одну сторону направляются. 16 человек, в другую 20, в некоторые страны вообще считают возможным мне направлять. А кого-то пытаются учить, пусть жену свою учат щеварить. Что касается различных слухов по поводу денежного состояния, я смотрел некоторые бумажки на этот счет, просто болтавания, которые нечего обсуждали, просто чушь. все выговорили из носа и размазывали по своим бумажкам вот так я к этому отношусь Александр Колесничан, аргумент и факт. А потом вы знаете, а какой агрессивности можете перечислить? Мы ликвидировали все свои базы за границей Мы что, на кого-то нападаем, что? Мы развязали какие-то вооруженные конфликты Мы что, вышли из каких-то основополагающих договоров в сфере разоружения Мы все исполняем. Вот эта дискуссия подо все, которые наши партнеры. Давайте по-честному посмотрим. Вы можете написать в своих журналов, что вы хотите. Вот вы это посмотрите сами. О граждане Европы. Значит по поводу того, что Газпром вгрызается в тело Европы. И говорят об этом вошентонпост, да? В острове. В острове Джон. Чего так американцы беспокоятся за европейское тело? не знаю, может быть, потому что сами не хотят от него трываться, нравится тело хорошее. Что касается зубов, которые куда-то вгрызаются, экс-мобил вгрызается в нашу экономику и ничего, там стоматолог есть, которые только точат им эти зубки, или шел, или бипи, я не уверен, что я все понял из того, что вы спросили, но тем не менее попробую ответить. Конечно, нацеленность на результат Возьмите, что и в Чистого частного капитала в России в прошлом году. Это о чём говорит? О каком-то сдерживании, что ли? Потом тех, кого вы назвали поимённо, так далеко не все, я бы сказал, не всех можно отнести к политическому руководству страны. Какой там политическую руководству? Я ещё не заметил, кого из политического руководства назвали. Делаем им делом. Каждый должен моты жить, как святой франциск, в своем участке, ежедневно. И тогда успех будет обеспечен. Но все имеют право высказываться. Это, кстати говоря, это говорит о хорошем, достаточно демократическом состоянии внутри российских элит. возможные динаминации и даже говорят о том, что уже отпечатаны якобы новые рубли. Да врут они всё, не верьте. Ну, а вот всё-таки среднесрочная перспектива есть? Не среднесрочная, не долгосрочная, нет и не будет. Вы даете гарантию? Слушайте, я же... Вы чего, хватит, чтобы я землю ел из горшка с цветами? Спасибо. Не клялся на крови. Это глупо просто. Нет никакой необходимости экономической. Возвращаю, что обо мне пишут. Если бы я реагировал на то, что обо мне пишут и корректировал свое поведение с этим, то вряд ли мы добились бы таких результатов как сегодня. Я помню, когда произошло нападение международных террористов на Дагестан. Я видел эти фотографии с клыками, с которых кровь капает. Я помню, но я был внутренний, абсолютно убежден в том, внутреннее, что мы делаем все правильно. И другого выбора у нас нет. Значит, что касается отношения к России, хорошо или плохо относится? Хорошо относится к России. И если кто-то что-то пишет, если организует какие-то компании, то это не говорит об отношении населения тех стран, в которых появляются те иные статики. Мы себя поведем, если начнется одностороннее признание одностороннего объявления Косового Своей Независимости. Не будем ли мы делать то же самое? Да мы вообще не собираемся обезьянничать. Если кто-то принимает дурное, неправовое решение, это не значит, что мы должны так же действовать. Но, конечно, для нас это сигнал. И мы будем реагировать на это поведение наших предметов. с тем, чтобы обеспечить наши интересы. Если они считают себя вправе обеспечивать свои интересы таким образом, почему мы не можем. Но мы, повторяю, не будем обезьяничать и действовать обязательно вот так же, прямой нелинейной или зеркально. У нас есть домашние заготовки и мы знаем, что мы будем. Вы будете работать где-то в другом месте, в другой работе. Может ли изменится ваше отношение? Меня нассораживает. Вы меня отсылаете, куда где-то вы будете работать. Нет, нет, я... Вы куда ездите отдыхать? Вы знаете, я должна сказать, что никуда я отдыхаю на работу уже четыре года. Ну понятно, я 8 лет отдыхаю. Вы бы куда ходили, поехать, отдохнуть, на лыжих покататься, на море съездить. У вас есть желание, вот куда поехать? Так только по-честному. У глаза мне все бы снаряжено. Куда отвернулась? Все эти 8 лет я пахал как раб на галерах с утра до ночи. И дело это с полной обдачей сил. Я доволен результатами своей работы. Я полагаю, что заказчик российских народ и избиратель, который проголосовал за меня дважды на выборах президента Российской Федерации, в целом удовлетворен.","I don't think that someone is seduced to show some ultimatum of Russia, especially the organization with such a bad-natured for Russian ear, which is like a bitch. We invited 100 people here. We are ready to provide them with any opportunity to work. They have a lot of money, they need to come here for a year or three weeks. They wanted to. They are on the one side directing, 16 people, 20 in some countries, they think it is possible to send me. And someone tries to teach, let his wife teach to cook. As for various rumors about the financial condition, I watched some papers on this account, just talking, which is not to be discussed. Just nonsense. They talked about it all, and they spread it on their paper. That's how I think about our country. Alexander Kalisnichan, the argument of the FACH. And then you know what aggressiveness is. We liquidated all our bases abroad. We attacked someone, we made some armed conflicts. We left some basic contracts in the field of arms. We are doing everything. This discussion is for all our partners. Let's look at it honestly. You can write in your magazines what you want. But you personally look at it as a citizen of Europe. So, about the fact that Gazprom is being threatened in the body of Europe. And they say about this Washington Post, right? What is so American to worry about the European body? Maybe because they don't want to tear themselves off. They like good bodies. As for teeth that are bitten somewhere, our economy is not threatened by X-mobile. There are some who only sharpen their teeth. Or Shell or BP. I'm not sure I understood everything from what you asked. But anyway, I'll try to answer. Of course, the purpose of the result is to There are two important factors, if we talk about the influence of personal factors on the achievement of the result. This is the ability to formulate an ambitious task, not to be able to let people down for every reason. The first person of the state does not have the right to do so. If they let people down for every reason, and cry that we will not be able to do anything bad, we will be like this. The main goal of the project is to achieve the goals and mobilise the public and the state forces. It is not very clear whether it is a storm or negative impact on the economy. It is a rare case for the current Russian leadership. How do you comment on these statements? Thank you. I have not heard these statements. We should at least look at them in the record. Our foreign policy does not have an influence on the development of the Russian economy. I have already brought in the figures of 80 billion The only private capital in Russia last year. What is it about? What does it mean? Is it about some kind of detachment? Then those who you called, not all of them, I would say, can not be taken to the political leadership of the country. What political leadership is there? I have not noticed who you called political leadership. In any case, everyone should live like a Saint Francis in their own part, in the name of God, every day. And then success will be ensured. But everyone has the right to say. By the way, it speaks about a good, enough democratic state within the Russian elite. possible denomination and even say that already printed, supposedly new rubles lie they are all not believe but here is still the average age of the perspective is not the average age of the long-term no it will not give you a guarantee listen I'm enough to eat the ground with the pot with flowers I was not lying on the edge it's stupid just no need for economic About what they write about me. If I would always react to what they write about me and correct my behavior with this, I think that we would hardly have achieved such results today. I remember when an attack of international terrorists on Dagestan took place. I saw my photos with the shells of which the blood was dripping. I remember, but I was absolutely convinced that we are doing everything right and we have no other choice. As for the relations to Russia, are they good or bad? They are good relations to Russia. If someone writes something, if they organize some companies, it does not mean the relations of the population of those countries where these other articles appear. We will act if we start to admit the unilateral declaration of the Kosovo independence. We will not do the same. We are not going to be a monkey. If someone makes a stupid and illegal decision, it does not mean that we should act the same. But of course, for us it is a signal. We will react to this behavior of our people. We will not be able to act in such a way that is not linear or mirror. We have domestic work and we know what we will do. I already told you. Where do you go to relax? You know, I have to say that I have not gone anywhere. I have been resting for 4 years. I understand, I am 8 years old. But where would you go to relax, to ride the boats, to go to the sea? Do you have a desire? Where to go? Just to be honest. I have everything in my eyes. Where did you go? All these 8 years. I was walking like a slave on the galleros. From morning till night. And this is a complete failure of the power. I am satisfied with the results of my work. I believe that the customer of the Russian people is the voter who voted for me in the elections of the President of the Russian Federation, in general, is satisfied."

The question is, why in the country that is presented when you go to sleep with someone else or her lover or someone else, you consider yourself a liar and you hurt my heart and blood and feelings with your blood and blood, you have already deceived me? Why? It's not normal. And then you find yourself a stranger, something called swingers. The stranger changes his girlfriend and his girlfriend, and he goes to sleep with her. And then you find yourself a stranger, the father and mother, they are not married, if you go to sleep with someone else, and your son-in-law goes to sleep with their mother. But the society's culture is called a normal. And the law is called a normal. And then we find that there are children and girls who don't care about the word of prayer. Or the last one, the last one. And they consider that sleeping with one person is not a part of the prayer. And sleeping with one person is not their culture. So there is a problem here. There is a contradiction between the society's culture and the society itself. The culture is called a normal. And the people inside say that it is not a normal. They want to develop the concept of this contradiction. Of course, because all the directors think of sleeping in the morning and they have to start their own business. So they say, let's start the business. Let's put a new thing in his hand. One of them entered his room and he slept with his friend. He's a regular person.

Is there a way to start this? Wait, no. The society will stop to accept these useless actions. Okay, why don't we do something like this? We're walking alone and we're putting it on the society. The real job is to be in the movie for 18 years. The question is why? Why is that? The answer is simple, cinema is not just an art, it's a creation and a potato. Cinema is also a business. God says, we are like people who love and care about each other. You have a son who loves something and you are in his hands to give them this thing. No, you are also in your hands to sell them. Of course, you don't have to give them money. Do you want to keep on giving them pictures of what they want? But it's very much like you. The whole thing is people love sex.

I mean, if I already have a meeting subscribed to Reniek, in which only the registration file will come out, I can request that they access me to the biometric system but the request is to have a subscription agreement with the capture through a small modem many times many many times this reneg is going to give you some data from a provider or the reneg itself will provide you that type of modem only for the public.

So, you know, sometimes I can get these right off the bat, and if I do, you know, I'd make sure to upload them the next day. But sometimes I can't. So you guys just gotta understand that I try my best, but I'm not like the best Call of Duty player in the world or anything like that. That's just, you know, that's pretty ridiculous to think that. I think I'm a fairly strong player in Call of Duty, but I'm by far not the best. And Marfor3 at least. and uh... and also like i know that's i've been uploading a lot of different stuff like lately i've been uploading like called it for scrim videos and you know public pro mod and all this stuff like that's uh... i've put a black ops video and you know it's kinda good for variety uh... i'd love called it the whole series in my opinion is just a fantastic game surely change their ways a lot since you know called it for after and it hasn't really been for the better but it's not necessarily been for the worst either you know they're just i guess trying out new things similar to how i try out new videos on my channel. I don't see a whole lot of people using it. So it's not that really that big of a deal to me. But yeah, so that's just kind of what I wanted to get off my chest and unload. And I'm not saying that I can't get these Moabs because I can. I can go spend maybe three or four hours and get three or four good Moab gameplays that I know you guys will definitely like and definitely want to watch. But I just always want to make sure that the next video I upload is up to par with my status. I don't want to upload a regular MP7 Moab. I would never do that anymore because that has been uploaded so many times and I know you guys expect more for me than an average MP7 MOI so that's why I'll try to go with like a Double or triple MP7 MOI but like a thermal all kills aim down the sights or you know and now that I've got them over the Snipers I know you guys probably expect me to do it now with like thermal and other things like that so you know they're getting difficult and more difficult but then also at the same time I'm getting more experienced at the game because I'm having to put more time into it so now like when I go into that aim from all the previous call of duty and you can implement it into each new one. I'm sure the game you know is different every year but I think it stays similar you know it's very similar you know it's an FPS a first-person shooter so it's easy to adjust from one call of duty to the next so anyways guys it's just kind of what I wanted to talk about today in this video and I hope you guys enjoyed and understand if you did you know consider leaving a like or a favorite that would be awesome you guys have been smashing the likes lately getting me up to 3,000 4,000 likes which really helps my channel grow So a big thank you to you guys if you want so you can check out the other videos on screen and Subscribe as well.

Well really a war on America. When you look at it from that standpoint there are 8 billion tons of coal being burned in the world as we speak. The United States of America consumes about 1 billion tons. Now what's going to happen to the other 7 billion tons? What's going to happen to the countries that are consuming and using 7 billion and it's increasing rapidly? Nothing's being done there. We have done more to clean up the environment than ever. in the last two decades and there's more that can be done. The President is looking at some scientists and whoever's advising him, trying to meet standards that I haven't even been perfected because the government hasn't worked with the private industry to perfect the technologies. We do have technologies that can help tremendously. We're caught in between right now. We have older plants, coal-fired plants that would be retrofitted, but if they try to retrofit them, they have to meet standards that are unobtainable. So you know what they do? Nothing. They can't become cleaner because of government regulation. So, by the way, there's no scientific consensus on the degree to which we can stop or slow climate change, no matter what the president says. That's ridiculous. What do you think of his description of you and the coal industry as, quote, special interests, whereas the renewable people, solar wind, who take tons of government subsidies, they're not special interests? Well, the president and the leadership of this administration has to realize that they're the leaders of all 300 plus million of us, all 50 states, are involved here and we're all looking to be part of this great economy, a great society and this great democracy and we need some leadership that really brings us all in rather than dividing us apart. You know, I'm not a scientist, but I don't believe that the wind currents or the ocean currents begin or end right over America. If that's the case then, we only burn one-eighth of the consuming, one-eighth of the cold that's burned in the world. How are we all to blame and why are we taking the hit that we're going to be taking? Why is this economy going to be taking this hit. Why are jobs going to be lost? And they will be lost no matter what. And here's the other thing to both Stephen Tucker, you know, even the EIA, which is the energy department that the president, his administration, they're saying that they're depending on co-op through 2040 for about 35% of the energy. How they going to replace it? Yeah, exactly. What are they going to do? You know what? And just as I think when George Bush left office, guess was what, Buck 90 again, now it's close to double that. This essentially especially by restricting the coal industry would cause every time we flip on the switch that price is going to go up every time somebody plugs in their electric car that's going to go up as well. And Senator, I want you to listen to the President of the United States calling out people who aren't on his side. patients for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society. I want to work with him. I've reached out. I will continue to reach out, but I need a partner here. I don't need an adversary. I need a partner and an advocate. Well, they just heard you down the street. Senator, thank you.

Vì ba con cũng đáp ứng cho con những nhu cầu đó Còn mẹ thì sao? Mẹ thì... Có lúc cho lúc không? Có khi nào con nói ba từ chối hay không? Hay là lúc nào ba cũng đồng ý? Cũng có lúc ba từ chối Thì tại sao có lúc bà lại không đáp ứng nhu cầu của huy? Con xin gì mà ba không cho? thì có lẽ cũng hơi quá mức. Cho nên ba cũng không cho. Lúc đó thì con buồn không? Con có nghĩ là ba không thương mình không? Lúc đó thì con cũng nghĩ vậy. Rồi sau đó thì con nghĩ sao nè? Dạ, sau đó thì con mới hiểu ra là ba cũng rất là thương con. Nhưng vì cái món đó nó đòi hỏi quá lớn nên ba con không thể đáp con. Đâu khi là nó đáp tiền quá, hoặc là nó thực sự không cần thiết với con đúng không? Thưa chị Huyên, hồi nãy Huy có chia sẻ là chị dù như là cũng hơi khác hay một chút trong các yêu cầu của Huy, đúng không à? Chị có thể chia sẻ một chút về quan niệm của mình không? Khi mà bé nó có nhiều cầu thì chắc có lẽ mình không có thể nào đáp ứng liền cho bé Mặc dù cái đó cũng cần thiết cho bé nhưng mà mình cũng phải có một cái mốc thời gian hay là một cái mốc nào đó để cho bé nó phấn đấu hay gì thì mình mới mua cho bé Chứ không phải là bé nó Nó đòi hỏi mình đáp ứng liền, lâu ngày làm cho bé có thói quen, nó muốn được. Hành ra nhiều khi bé không hiểu mẹ, bé nói là bé nghĩ về mẹ, hơi khắc khe. Từ đó bé ít có chia sẻ với mẹ cái du cầu của mình. Chúng ta có thể phân tích cho bà, hiểu những món đồ phải phù hợp với lứa tuổi của bé và phù hợp với điều kiện kinh tế của gia đình Chỉ nhiên là những cái đáp ứng của ba mẹ cũng phải phụ thuộc vào ít nhiều vào cái kinh tế của gia đình nữa đúng không à? Thế thì lại có 1 cái quan điểm nặng ra là với những phụ huynh gia đình khái giả thì họ cho rằng họ thừa xuất để đáp ứng cho con tất cả những cái yêu cầu của con và họ chính vì vậy khi mà con họ yêu cầu điều gì hay là đòi hỏi những cái gì thì họ đều đáp ứng ngay thì cũng là 1 phụ huynh chị sẽ chia sẻ điều gì với những gia đình ấy à? Những cái phụ huynh đó là cái như là đáp ứng những cái yêu sách của cô bé cái đó cái gọi là yêu sách đó thì Vô tình làm cho bé hư bởi vì lâu ngày bé nghĩ là nó muốn là được Nó không có một cái gì để mà phấn đấu Thí dụ như con mình đặt ra tiêu chuẩn con phải làm được việc này thì mẹ mới tặng cho con cái đó Thì nó còn có cái hướng phấn đấu Từ đó mình nghĩ là nếu như vậy thì bé nó Hình như là nó không biết thương cha mẹ Nó chỉ nghĩ đến bản thân đó thôi ứt kỷ đúng rồi Cũng chưa biết trân trọng giá trị của đồng tiền giá trị của lao động Trở lại với Huy nè Ở lớp của Huy hoặc là những bạn Mà mẹ quanh huy thì có bạn nào trong trường hợp mà cô Thảo vừa nói không có nghĩa là khi mà đòi hỏi cái gì thì ba mẹ lập tức đáp ứng ngay? Dạ cũng có, mấy bạn Những bạn đó thì điều kiện gia đình mà như thế nào nè? Dạ, nhà mấy bạn cũng vào có Khá dạ Thì khi mà bạn khoe với huy những món đồ mà ba mẹ đáp ứng ngay cho các bạn ấy thì có khi nào huy cảm thấy là mình cũng muốn có và về để xin ba mẹ không? Dạ, cũng có lúc thì con cũng muốn có những món đồ đó Ví dụ như là cái gì nè? Mấy bạn có chia sẻ với con là khi muốn một món đồ thì các bạn thường làm mình làm mảy hoặc là yêu sát với ba mẹ như thế nào không? Mấy bạn chia sẻ với con là Mỗi khi mà muốn ba mẹ mua cho một món gì thì mấy bạn cứ dọa ba mẹ chuyện này chuyện kia Ví dụ dọa cái gì nè? Mấy bạn dọa là nghỉ học rồi Bỏ nhà đi Mấy bạn là luyện đáp ứng cho mấy bạn à con con cứ nào con nghĩ con cũng áp dụng biết chiếu đó của hi vọng đó không? dạ không tại sao vậy? dạ vì cái đó mấy món đồ nó không thật sự cần thiết cho con","Nice to meet you again in Love Cuisine.

Today, we will continue the show with two guests. Please come with the introduction of the two guests. Hello, my audience of Love Cuisine. My name is Le Thuy Linh Huyen. My main job is to take care of two children. I'm here with a lovely show to hope that I can have better experiences. I'll take care of the two of us. Goodbye, viewers of the show. My name is Ho Quang Quy. I'm in the 6th grade of Le Quy Don school. I'm here with a show to hope that our two children understand each other better. Do you have a job? I'm at home taking care of them. I'm very close to them. So what do you usually do? I usually do my homework. Besides, I can do my homework with my mom. I can do my homework with my mom.

How much do you think your mom's got? About 90% percent. About 90% percent. A very high number. To know how many percent you and Huyen can get, we'll start today with the first question to understand each other. As usual, we'll have 10 questions. 5 questions about your information and 5 questions about your mother's information. Are you ready? Please start the questions of today's show. I want to use the medicine that my mom loves. I like it. What do you like to listen to? A doctor. A doctor. The percentage is not as good as the result of the two mothers, right? This is just a fun test. It has not been shown that the two mothers have a different understanding. But I hope that through the test, the two mothers will have more interesting information about each other. They will know more about each other, right? And next, I would like to invite the audience and the two mothers, Ms. Linh Huyen, will also know more about each other. about the love of young people through a corner. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

But because of that, I was too big. So I couldn't... You were too rich. Or you didn't need me. I think Huy has shared a bit of a different story about her. Can you share a bit about your relationship? When she has a lot of demands, I think I can't answer her immediately. Although I need to give her a lot of time, I have to give her a lot of time to make her fight. I just bought her a lot of time. She asked me to answer immediately. She said she had a habit of being used to it. She wanted to do it. She didn't understand me. She said she thought I was a bit different. She didn't share her needs with me. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Linh Huyen shares her big motivation with the show. When she met the love-hate couple, she ended up being a member of the family. To help the members of the family understand each other. I think that I can accept the questions that Huy asked me. For example, I can't deny that I can help her study. But I can't deny that I can help her study. I can tell her how I feel about it. I can tell her that I can tell her how I feel about it. I can tell her how I feel about it.

I share with you that whenever I want to buy something for my parents, they keep telling me to do this and that. What do you tell them? They tell me to take a rest and leave home. They respond to me. Do you think I'm a little bit too much? Yes. Why? Because those items don't really need to be used."

According to the knowledge with the questions that local self-care is dealing with, the president of the public city thinks that the student is important to get to know and with local politics. Local politics is something that, maybe the proposal is not interesting, but something that is typical of every function of every animal. How the transportation goes, how the water is from the canalization, The central part of the game is how it works, it's green, and so on. That's what the social and social life of the day is like. Every moment you are on the street while I'm in your house, that's more local politics. To see this in view, the connection of the school theory with Prague is the best treatment and political solution of the student, said their professor and me. The presence of such a subject as the state of law of the citizen, which exists in the gymnasium, is a general type. I think it should be and to make sense of the moment when we arrive at this place. Of course, we asked what we thought and thought about this visit. The teacher said that we came to the community building to meet important people in the new era. We will have a chance to ask questions that interest us. We are now forming a political barrier to see how the function of the community will work. I will write the right faculty, probably this will mean."

Nossa equipe foi conferir de perto as denúncias e descobriu uma área devastada pela própria prefeitura. É difícil acreditar, mas essa é uma obra concluída na praia de Camburia em São Sebastião. O local era para estar assim, uma área de preservação permanente, mas a prefeitura decidiu derrubar a mata nativa na margem do rio para evitar enchentes na na comunidade do Areião, ocupação irregular desde a década de 90. Tiraram as árvores, tiraram o material do fundo, o rio jogaram nas margens, ou seja, eles tiraram, além de tirar a vegetação, que é a mar de preservação, que é a mata ciliar, eles aterraram as margens impedindo o crescimento de novas plantas. Esse crime ambiental foi revelado por meio de um mapeamento aéreo que está sendo feito na costa sul de São Sebastião há um ano e meio pela Fundação Pro-Acosta Atlântica, que reúne especialistas, moradores, comerciais, e empresários da região. O que assusta é que esse é somente um dos problemas encontrados. foram construídos com mais de 9 metros de altura, o que é proibido por lei. que eu assumo pra você que nós temos que fazer uma recuperação mais rápido possível da lida aquela mata cilhar porque é uma mata extremamente importante pra aquela região e agora os nossos trabalhos são nesse sentido tentar recuperar o que foi perdido ali e sobre as construções irregulares o prefeito da cidade disse que a fiscalização existe mas por conta da extensão da costa que é 110 quilômetros é difícil evitar esse tipo de irregularidade ponto fundamental o plano diretor em cima disso nós estamos criando ali a opção dos bolsões habitacionais ao longo do município para criar lotes populares, para que essa população tenha a opção de ficar legalizada, né, fazer suas construções de acordo com a lei. Sobre as construções com mais de nove metros de altura, o prefeito informou que depende de decisões judiciais para a demolição desses imóveis.","São Sebastião held an audience yesterday to discuss irregular occupation in areas of environmental preservation on the south coast of the city. Our team went to check the reports closely and discovered a area devastated by the Prefectural itself. It is difficult to believe, but this is a work concluded at Camburia beach in São Sebastião. The place was to be like this, a permanent preservation area, but the Prefectural decided to demolish the native forest on the edge of the river to avoid floods in the in the area's community, a regular occupation since the 90s. They took the trees, took the material from the bottom, the river, they threw it on the banks, that is, they took, in addition to the vegetation, which is the preservation sea, which is the silicone forest, they buried the banks, preventing the growth of new plants. This environmental crime was revealed by a aerial mapping that is being done on the south coast of São Sebastião, a year and a half, by the pro-coastal foundation, which brings together specialists, residents, and businessmen in the region. What scares is that this is only one of the problems found. In the same place, the esgotus goes straight to the Camburi River. The trash is everywhere and even the river course was modified in this area. In the beach of the Saíha Barra, the images of before and after are impressive. Only in this community would be almost without irregular constructions, more in one and a half years. In Juqueí, the UNG denounced that luxury furniture were built with more than nine meters of height, which is forbidden by law. Several years ago, the federation always fought for this issue, always guided and tried to draw attention to the public power of the municipal and it was never done anything and if you don't take a resolution in relation to solve different problems, the trend is just to get worse. The complaints were presented in a public audience. The Secretary of the Environment assumes that there was a serious error in the work carried out by the prefecture in Rio What I assume for you is that we have to do a recovery as quickly as possible from that ciliary forest, because it is an extremely important forest for that region and now our work is in that direction, trying to recover what was lost there. And about the irregular constructions, the mayor of the city said that the tax is there, but because of the extension of the coast, which is 110 kilometers, it is difficult to avoid this type of irregularity. by creating the option of the housing pockets along the municipality to create popular lots so that this population has the option to be legalized, to make their buildings according to the law. About the buildings with more than 9 meters of height, the mayor informed that it depends on judicial decisions for demolition of these buildings."

The American border gave way to the lands of culture and cities, and new technologies transformed communities, but few innovations made the change as much as advances in armament technology. The laborious manual mosquettes gave way to the riffs of the Palanka repetition. The pistols of a single war The first and terroristic machine gun, a weapon that had to be killed and that would transform the armed conflicts forever. These are the Red Dead Redemption weapons. The weapons of the time were meticulously investigated. In addition to a wide range of revolvers to choose from, the culprits can also buy the automatic gun guns. The Frank-Tirador rifles, popularized for the first time in the Civil War, were used by the Red Dead Redemption. To fight the battle, players can use the shotgun. For a bigger damage, Marston can use a buffalo rifle, which inflicts a catastrophic damage to men or beasts. When the enemies face multiple enemies, players can use the gatling. But if there is no weapon available, archaic weapons such as a knife or an explosive bottle will be enough. In the same way, the tactical use of the dynamite can change rapidly. The technology behind the shooting and the physical reactions behind the real-time, the Red Dead Redemption is driven by a hybrid of the Rage engine, the Rockstar Games, and the Euphoria engine of Natural Motion. This technology applies dynamic movement synthesis to the gameplay, assigning real physical elements to the enemies that will feel the real contention of a shooting. Each impact is recreated in a unique way by the game engine. When the death is not the objective, the game is not the objective. He's up there, friend. on the enemies when passing the reticle. The most experienced players will be able to put the shots individually to obtain a devastating effect. From the used in the scrammages on the roads, to the employees in great shooting on a large scale, the Red Dead Redemption weapons are part of the effort of Rockstar Games for offering the most immersive, technologically advanced and highly playable games in the open world."

So this is the final form of what I've done to this guitar. I've replaced the tremolo with the Wilkinson with a steel block, same one I've used on a bunch of other projects that you can you may have seen in other videos. A different pick art assembly than what was in the previous videos. This one has a set of hand wound rose robustos. That's kind of their version of a fat 50s type pickup. These are hand wound by Ken Curry with rose pickups out in California. Great sounding pickups I think you'll be really impressed with the tones I get out of these. So other than that, this thing is ready to go and will hopefully be going to its new home in a few weeks and hopefully the new owner will be very, very happy with it. So let me go ahead and demo this with starting out at the neck pickup by itself and I'll just kind of go through each position so you can hear the different sounds from this nice little strap. very nice clean classic strutty sounds out of that. I'll play with a little overdrive right now. Great sounds out of this guitar. So this is again the Squier Strat SE. Truly bargains if you find them on the used market. Typically you can find the guitar for less than $100 and then they're just great for using as build platforms because they fully thick bodies and you can put a good tremolo in it and drop a nice picture guard assembly into it and just give it a good setup and it's as good as any Strat out there. Nice guitars. Thank you.","Hi, this is the final episode of the Strat SE series, the Squire Strat SE series that I started on this particular project.

Como vocês estão? Então, eu não sei se vocês notaram, acho que sim, que eu tosei meu cabelinho e guardei o que sobrou, a pedação que eu cortei. E assim, vou aproveitar ele para fazer uma mexa de uma receita que eu vou falar. Hoje eu vou falar de soup cap. O soap cap é erradamente chamado de decap-color caseiro. Ele não é o decap-color caseiro. A forma do decap-color é completamente diferente. Ela não tem amônia, ela não tem discolorante, ela não tem nada disso. Ela tem um monte de ingrediente de nome difícil. Deixa eu ver se dá pra ver. Não é um de nós por aí. Não sei se vocês vão conseguir ver porque a taxa é meio que reflecte. Mas enfim. O resultado do DECAP é assim, na prática, falando na prática. O resultado do DECAP é muito menos agressivo do que o do SOAPCAP. Porém, SOAPCAP em geral é mais eficiente. Só que aí você tem que ter bom senso, testar e mexar para saber qual que você vai usar, qual que é o mais indicado. Então assim, a receita do DECAP não tem muito o que falar, porque eu já tenho um vídeo sobre isso. é você pegar a fase 1 e misturar na fase 2 e deixar a meia hora sobre queve você vai misturar os coloriante, pode ser qualquer um, tá? de preferência um bom eu peguei aqui o hígara que tem que ser um restinho sobrando e calhado é shampoo e água oxigenada de preferência e a gente faz uma descoloração então e assim qual que é a receita do sop cap o sop cap você faz com uma porção uma parte de descolorante uma de shampoo e uma de água oxigenada na descoloração normal você faz com uma parte de com uma parte de escloreante e duas de água oxigenada. Então o que você vai fazer? A diferença da escloração para o soapcap é substituir uma parte de água oxigenada por uma parte de shampoo. É basicamente isso. De preferência shampoo anti resíduos, em pesa profunda desses transparentinhos. Eu gosto bastante, eu sempre falo que eu gosto muito dos champus da nature. O anti resíduos dele é bom. Então o que eu vou fazer? Vou mostrar o resultado de como escolore, usando uma mexa do meu escapelo. Então eu vou tirar a umbinacinha, passar o decap e passar o subcap com a oxigenada de gente para ver o tanto que vai sair. Se daria certo, qual daria o melhor resultado nesse caso aqui. Então daqui a pouquinho eu volto Voltei. Não passou exatamente meia hora, mas como eu já... Tem mais que fazer... gravar um vídeo aqui... falando sozinho... E aqui estava a enxaguar... aqui o doce... o que é? Gente, vocês não acham muito idiota gravar vídeo? Tipo assim... É... Fica falando meio que sozinho... Eu acho tão... pisado... Eu me sinto muito louca, sabe? É bom de vergonha de alguém ouvir, alguém da família assim em casa. Tá bom, enfim. Aqui é o do... Esse aqui é o do decap. Dá pra ver que fica até... Parece até um creminho, sabe? E ele cuxa pro roxo, porque ele tá... prevalecendo a cor da base. Que a base dessa cor que tá no meu cabelo era um roxo. Mas pelo menos foi bem um pouquinho, bem um pouquinho. Então assim... Que legal, não tem toado para secar. Desculpe. Tudo de capa como fica a corna para ver. O estado do cabelo. Nem um fiozinho elástico. Esse aqui vai chamar melhor, né? Se não me ameelar. Esse aqui... Descoloreu para o roxo. Para o verde aliás, olha errado. Tá vendo? e os fios estão vendo arrebentar na minha mão? Então assim, nunca acham que é a mesma coisa porque não é. Primeiro resultado são cores completamente diferentes. Eu levei a base aqui as duas partes de cima. É completamente diferente. Então ficou aí já lendo já a receita, a importância de um teste de mexe. Espero que tenham gostado. Um beijo aí gente, boa semana. Tchau tchau.","I have a good agent with you guys so I don't know if you noticed, I think so I put my hair and I kept what was left, the piece that I cut and so I'm going to use it to make a mix of a recipe that I'm going to talk about today I'm going to talk about soup cap The soap that is wrongly called the Capcolor Casero. It is not the Capcolor Casero. The shape of the Capcolor is completely different. It does not have ammonia, it does not have discolorant, it does not have anything like that. It has a lot of ingredients, hard name, I don't know if you can see it. I don't know if you can see it because the box is kind of reflective. But anyway, The result of the decap is much less aggressive than the soap cap. But in general, the soap cap is more efficient. You have to have good sense, test and mix to know which one you will use, which is the most indicated. So, the decap recipe doesn't have much to talk about, because I already have a video about it. You take phase 1 and mix it in phase 2. Leave it for half an hour. If you want, you will mix it with the coloring. It can be any one, it's up to you. I got Igor here, because he only has a little left, a remaining one. Shampoo and oxygenated water. 20 or 30, because it doesn't make much sense to make 40, you make a discoloration. And so, what is the recipe for the soap cap? With the soap cap you make a portion of the discolorant, one of shampoo and one of oxygenated water. In normal discoloration you make with one part with a part of the colorant and two of the oxygenated water. So what are you going to do? The difference of the coloration for the soap that wants to be a part is to replace an oxygenated water part with a part of shampoo. It is basically that. Preferably shampoo anti-residual, deep, of these transparent ones. I like it a lot, I always say that I like the natural shampoo a lot. The anti-residual is good. So what am I going to do? I will show the result of how colors are using a mesh of my hair. So I'm going to take the pineapple, pass to the decamp and pass to the subcap with the oxygen of people so we can see how much will come out. We see if it would work. Which would give the best result in this case here. So here I'm back a little bit. I'm back. It took me exactly half an hour, but as I already ... There's nothing else to do, recording videos here ... Talking alone ... And here I was ... here is the ... the ... the ... what ... People, don't you think it's stupid to record videos? Like ... It's ... I'm talking a little bit alone ... I think so ... Piss off ... I feel very crazy, you know? It's a shame to hear someone from the family at home. It's good, anyway. This one is from the DECAPE. You can see that it even looks like a little cream, you know? And it's red because it's... ...prevales the color of the base. The base of this color is my hair, it was a red. But by the way, it was a little bit, very little. So, like this. Oh, that's cool, I can't touch your face. I'm sorry. The cap world, as it is the body to see. The hair style. Not even an elastic wire. This one will be the best, right? This one is my mother's. This one, I discolored to the red. To the green, by the way, I said it was wrong. See? and the wires are going to break in my hand. So I never think it's the same thing because it's not the first result. They are completely different colors. I took the base of the two parts from above. It's completely different. So I've already read the recipe, the importance of a touch of mesh, I hope you enjoyed it. Kisses."

I'm over killing this. Hello, my name is Ritesh Okenegbinejia from Coco Mansion and you are watching the Lays Your Marriage Show. Keep watching to BAD. I am here with Rita Issoke, the pioneer of a Cocoa Mansion. She left the Cocoa Mansion two months ago and still has not been interviewed. Guess who gets the exclusive? Yes, Lys. Rita, Rita, Rita. How are you? I'm fine. It's good to see you. Good for you to be on the show. Thank you very much. All right. So Rita, how did you get onto Coco Manchurian? I was really long story. Tell me, tell me. I'm very interested and I think everybody is interested out there. Alright. The first day, a guy called me that today, when I go to Coco Manchurian, there's a reality show called Coco Manchurian. And I said I'm more interested because I was saying I'm not beautiful enough. I don't have the money. You are beautiful. That's what I was saying then. So the guy said she would go and if I had the money I would get the phone So I went to a friend called Lucy She is my best friend so she gave me the money How much was it? 5000 EUR So I went to GT Bank I filled the phone I went back to the cafe I did the children's internet I submitted the phone to them So they called me for audition I went to Lagos He flew? Yes it was your first time on a plane? I went back home and they told me they picked me for the first audition I was so happy. I was thinking about it. I was going to say, we don't come here, we don't want you. I said, you know, the problem is, I'm just sick. As if something has gone bad in life, something must happen to you. Must have an experience. So she called me, picked me up. She said hello, we had a conversation. Among the 12 people I looked at, I said, what about the second audition? She said it's not important. I said, thank you very much. They said I'm okay with one audition. I was afraid that I was too young to do that Wow! Big family! Together you are 10. How many girls? How many boys? Six girls, four boys. And what do your family and your brothers and sisters think of what has been happening and the show? I would say they are really happy. They are proud of me. I took a step. My family. Where do you actually originate from? Like? What state? From a real state. I lived in a dual life. I am studying now I think everybody wants to talk about your time. We'll talk about what you've been doing since. But everybody wants to talk about your time in the mansion. Your first day, what was that like? If you remember, because it's long ago. My first day when I went to the mansion, I would just be a bit strange. What do you mean by strange? Like seeing love girls I was fighting for one particular thing, 5 billion dhamma, drinking one cup. I said, what is your deal? Because I went to go to the market for exposure. I would tell you, I didn't even bother to go to the market for winning. I really took the phone for exposure for people to know who I am. So I went there, I was behaving strange. I said, where am I? God, first thing that I did, 10 go to a wall, see what I have done for me. Because it was the person that brought me there. So I really did. So the first week, I was healed. Everybody was like a daughter, like a sister It's like they should take a stick inside that house and go and beat them for you Because they'll be like, how dare you? Because when you're watching the show, there's text People can't text in So if I... It's something... It used to show on Channel 204 Sky TV If I put 204 like this on Sky I would just be seeing the text messages Can the government not take... Can the government not shout at Rita? Why do you think people were drawn to you like that? I'll be saying this for so long. I say if you want to love me, love me for whom I am, not what I am. I think they think I'm a witty, I'm just witter, I'm nobody. I think there's something they say in me which I don't know. That makes them to like me. I think I'm caring I'm just free to everybody. How would you describe now you can look on it because it's past? Yeah. What kind of experience do you think it was?"

When I talk about it, you'll know what it is. The most common judgment is the English disk. OK, disk. The long-legged one is called the long-legged one. The center of the circle is the water-based, and the whole thing is the closest to the plate. You can think of it as a hockey club, but the middle is the water-based. But there is this thing. What are we doing? What is the closest plate? The plate. The plate connects the two bones, and it allows them to exercise. The most important thing is that they can reduce the pressure when we have an exercise. The second is that the spine has a joint. The door to the door is very important. The hematoma is slowly breaking out. The hematoma will come out. It's normal that the pain is caused by the inflammation. It may not hurt, so it's not the same for everyone.

And then take it out. And then turn around. Take the water. People take special ones. And take the vegetables. So you have to turn around. The fastest way to do it is to take the patient's pulse and make sure the patient is not taking the pulse to the pulse. It's a long-term process of making a baby baby. So it may affect the baby's baby's baby. So the baby's baby is only a piece of paper. It may be a piece of paper. We don't know how to make a baby baby. I know it's easy to make a baby baby. The baby's mother is the one who gave birth to the baby. She's the one who gave birth to the baby. They would bring the baby down like this. But there's no roof. Usually it's a roof over the roof. Maybe the ladies would bring things out. And they would be afraid of death. They would say, come out quickly. Some people would be heartbroken. They would bring things out. They would go out to travel. They would go to travel and put some money. They would go to the airport. I have never seen a friend who is very fast. It's not a big deal. It's true. If you don't think so many people are now crazy, it seems to be very painful. Is there any way to make it better? Can you put it back in? This thing may not be possible. There are a few ways to cure it, but it depends on the need. Usually it will not be the most accurate, such as surgery. When other factors affect, then look at the need itself. The reason is that you may not be able to do surgery. In addition, prevention is the most important. The reason is that we are not able to do surgery because of our knowledge. We are able to do the work in the knowledge. If we use the wrong method, how to use the correct method, if the bone is wrong, it is wrong, and if it is not recovered, it is necessary to do surgery. For example, we have a lot of office hours, we sit in front of the computer for 8 hours. Will this kind of knowledge affect us more easily? If your knowledge is very bad, the most important is to stay in the long-term. We all know that there are many layers in the middle. For example, you sit in the wrong knowledge for a day or two, it will not affect you. But if you stay in the wrong knowledge for a long time, it will give you a special pressure. When we stand up, we say we are 100% sure that the pressure is higher than when we stand up. About 120-140% of the pressure is 80%. So why not have a patient with a stomachache? Because it is more difficult to get a stomachache. The pressure has increased so much. I thought that the patient would do something wrong at home. But the pain in the body We have a lot of work to do, we have to thank our colleagues. The first thing to do is to adjust the position of the computer. So if the position of the computer is bad, you should do it again. It's easy. Where should you put the keyboard? If the keyboard is on the table, it's not right. The keyboard should be placed on the keyboard. It's lower. That's right. If your hand doesn't reach 90 degrees, your head should be close to the table. Don't tell him. Our company hasn't changed. You can't do this. I'm going to put the phone away first. Don't tell him. Everyone should pay attention. Ronnie, you can watch our show. Thank you for your message.

So the general thinking is that multimedia can enhance the way we naturally learn and form knowledge. In addition, Reber hypothesized that multimedia stimulates imagery and visualization. Imagery and visualization are mainly involved in creativity, discovery, and problem solving. In PiVio's dual coding theory, one channel processes which all makes sense if you think about it from a biological perspective. on any one part of our brain and also doubly reinforces the message we are receiving. However, this is not enough. The frontal lobe is the major locus of our thought processes. It's where we can make connections and make sense of abstract ideas. EEG readings have shown that this part of the brain is active when reading words. It is also where our working memory occurs, which means that using our frontal lobe is critical to learning and retaining information. So you can see that, when you use multimedia, you're engaging the whole brain instead of just one part of it. The Synergy that arises from combining different types of communications media. Not only do the various media have different strengths and weaknesses, but there are also major differences among students' ability to comprehend them. For example, Peds X, Simon, Stoker and Keely found that subjects with high visual spatial ability comprehend television better than people with weak visual ability. This example also goes to show the power of using multimedia to reinforce the same concept in multiple ways for a varied audience. According to Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory, we each have different strengths and weaknesses and preferences for certain modes of learning, thinking, and communication. By integrating a variety of multimedia into learning activities, not only do you activate the whole brain of each student, but you also ensure that students with a variety of intelligences or learning styles are given the information in a way that clicks with them. And with modern technology, multimedia is easier to create and consume than ever before. In fact, it's pervasive. In the past, it was quite costly and difficult to create multimedia and even to view it. But now, pretty much anybody can do it. anywhere like here or here or here or even here provide you a connection can you hear me now","But what are the advantages of combining these different types of media?

However, this is not enough. The frontal lobe is the major locus of our thought processes. It's where we can make connections and make sense of abstract ideas. EEG readings have shown that this part of the brain is active when reading words. It is also where our working memory occurs, which means that using our frontal lobe is critical to learning and retaining information. So you can see that, when you use multimedia, you're engaging the whole brain instead of just one part of it. The power of multimedia lies in the The Synergy that arises from combining different types of communications media. Not only do the various media have different strengths and weaknesses, but there are also major differences among students' ability to comprehend them. For example, Peds X, Simon, Stoker, and Keely found that subjects with high visual spatial ability comprehend television better than people with weak visual ability. This example also goes to show the power of using multimedia to reinforce the same concept in multiple ways for a varied audience. According to Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory, we each have different strengths and weaknesses and preferences for certain modes of learning, thinking, and communication. By integrating a variety of multimedia into learning activities, not only do you activate the whole brain of each student, but you also ensure that students with a variety of intelligences or learning styles are given the information in a way that clicks with them. And with modern technology, multimedia is easier to create and consume than ever before. In fact, it's pervasive. In the past, it was quite costly and difficult to create multimedia and even to view it. But now, pretty much anybody can do it. anywhere like here or here or here or even here provide you a connection can you hear me now"

You start taking over some of these objectives. Six of them throughout the process. If I recall I'm a little slow in actually taking the objectives on this level. There's gonna be huge pile of German troops there. Okay got him. I should probably try flanking around the building right now. Let's see if that's what I do. Yep. I don't like it. building barrels so I got a tendency just to get rid of them. Great enemies over there. I need to get inside that. I need to get inside this building to my right.

But the nadin is thoroughly annoyed by the existence of those barrels. I know they're like everywhere on this level. At least they're on this building. Oh god. Fail. Not proper techniques. I mean when you're clearing out buildings like this what you really gotta do is move forward and clear out the room. one at a time but don't quickly stop and just sit still because if you missed any guys they will be coming up behind you so what you want to do actually is spray your room but keep moving and then if you pause check it back like every time I stop on this level there's a guy right behind you usually not trying.

Now, we have learned that oxygen is a very important is responsible for receiving the electrons of the respiratory chain, the oriudus of the cofactors NADH and FADH2.

Tất nhiên, đây không phải đáo án cứu của anh. Với bạn thì kể cả khi nhìn mọi thứ có chẳng có vẻ gì là hỏng hốc cả, nhưng mà sớm mượn cũng sẽ hỏng hốc. Cũng may là lúc này là dù của bạn không làm sao, tức là bạn vẫn hạ cánh được, nhưng mà thật ra thì bạn cũng chưa biết được liệu điều gì có xảy đến hay không. Và lời quyên cho bạn là bạn nên cố gắng nhìn nhiều hơn vào phần tươi sáng của một vấn đề. Bí quan này có vẻ không đúng nhưng mà có phải là anh dường như là tuyếp người luôn dựu chù cho những gì xư xảo nhất có thể xảy đến hộn. Có anh không? Một phần nhỏ thôi. Tôi thì vẫn là người là quán. Nhưng một phần nhỏ thì tôi vẫn phải để phòng. Quay trở lại với đáp án anh muốn chọn ban đầu. Anh muốn rơi đến một nơi rất đông người. Trông thế. Tương bừng. Ví dụ có thể do anh bản năng và tự nhiên anh lại là một người nghệ sĩ. Và anh thường xuyên. phải đứng rất nhiều người, thường phải biểu diễn và đối mặt với rất nhiều người xung quanh. Và cơ hội và đối mặt nhiều người thế thì buộc phải toả sáng, phải thể hiện đúng không ạ? Khi mà người nghệ sự biểu diễn trên sức gấu là họ phải thể hiện khả năng của họ. Tại vì không có lý do gì mà từng đấy con người đang dõi mắt vào họ thì cái lý do mà chọn điểm rơi này có giống với cái bản năng mà khi anh biểu diễn trên sức gấu không? Tôi thì tôi chỉ nghĩ là... Vì nếu mà nhảy dù lần đầu tiên thì là... tôi phải tính rất là an toàn và trên hết. Thế là tôi nghĩ là phải phải chỗ nào đông người để lỡ cái gì thì là mình sắt sắt. An toàn là cao. Tôi thì tôi nghĩ thế. Thế thì giờ tôi đặt lại một tình hướng là khi anh biểu diễn phản ở có rất nhiều người xung quanh rồi thì anh có cảm xác an toàn như anh nhảy dù không? Vì như anh biểu diễn. Thường thì số lượng nhiều nhất đã xem anh diễn là bao nhiêu người? 2.000 từ 2.000 rồi đến 3.000. Ở nước ngoài? Thế thì cảm giác của anh như thế nào? Khi mà anh giả diễn thì thường như anh nhảy dù thì anh cảm thấy là anh muốn rơi vào chỗ đông người Tôi cảm giác lúc đầu khi mà chưa đánh thì mình trở đi trên dây Thôi một cái gì để... không phải là zoom là cho áp lực áp lực phải làm được cho nên là nó tự tạo cho là trong người mình có cái gì nó hồi hộp Anh nói là cái cảm giác trước khi vừa bước ra Khi anh bắt đầu biểu diễn anh có được cái cảm giác như là anh muốn là an toàn khi có đông người dông với anh không? Khi mà ra diễn thì tôi cũng có cảm giác vụ mỗi lần diễn nó luôn luôn cái chạng thái nó khác Có những lần thì mình có thể bánh hơi màu hiểm hơn, có thể bị lỗi nhiều mình bánh như tương bừng. Có những lần thì tôi lệ chọn cách bánh an toàn. Nếu là không quá là sáng lên như an toàn. Chò chơi nhảy dù thật ra là hầu hết chúng ta đều rất là ít người có cơ hội thử. Nhưng các bạn thân mến tại sao chương trình lại chúng ta lại có một tình huống là nhảy dù. Bởi vì trong cuộc sống thì cái việc rơi xuống ở một độ cao cũng được ví như là các bạn phải đối mặt với rất nhanh. và nhiều tình huống khác nhau trong cuộc sống và gần như chúng ta không biết chúng ta sẽ tiêm đất như thế nào hậu quả hay kết quả của mình đấy ra sao nhưng mà tôi rất thích những câu chuyện mà đến từ anh Mùi Công Di hay là một bạn khán giả của tôi có thể biến sự rơi đấy của mình trở thành một sân khấu hay là chọn một điều gì đó khó khăn nhất mà bạn có thể thử tượng để thử xem là khả năng của mình đến đâu thì đều là những câu trả lời và đều là cách sống các bạn lựa chọn trong cuộc sống của mình và muốn nhảy dù chỉ là một Ví dụ và các bạn thân vệ là cuộc sống của chúng ta thì có nhiều màn tiếp đất còn hoạn mục hơn Cho chơi nhảy dù rất nhiều Còn quay trở lại với chương trình ngày hôm nay chúng ta đã có một nghệ dĩ vio lông đúng không?

Vì thế nào? Vì nói là một cái đàn rất là cổ nhiều năm rồi. Từ 1.680 mấy. Từ tồi đời của nó là hơn 400 năm rồi. Cái đàn đấy lúc tôi mua thì nó cũng chưa tốt như bây giờ đâu. Tại vì rất là lâu, không ai đánh cả. Đàn cũng thế. Nhưng mà để lâu nữa thì nó sẽ không thể kêu được. Càng đánh thì nó sẽ càng giống mình. Vì khi tôi kéo cái đàn đấy ra, tôi kéo cái tiếng đàn mang ra thì tôi đã nhận thấy đây là cái rộng nói của cái ông, sắc sẻ mà tôi không thể đánh. Và cuối cùng cái đàn đấy thì lại đấy. Tại vì cái đàn đưa mình đánh lâu thì nó sẽ ảnh hưởng, nó tiếp thu được. Đang là cái rộng nói như của bọn con người.

I'll read the answer first, and we'll talk about this answer. Of course, this is not your final answer. With you, even if you look at everything, it may not seem like a big deal, but it's a big deal sooner or later. Luckily, even if you don't do anything, you can still do it. But actually, you don't know what kind of material is used. And I suggest you to try to look at more in the morning. This is not right, but you are always the one who takes care of the most important things. Only one small thing. I'm still a regular person. But I'm still the one who takes care of the most important things. I want to go back to the first place. I want to go back to a place that is very crowded. For example, maybe you are a artist and you are naturally a artist. And you are usually We have to stand with many people. We have to act and face with many people around us. And when we have to act, we have to be creative. We have to be creative. When we act, we have to be creative. Because there's no reason for people to be so good at acting. The reason for choosing this role is the same as the role you play in the drama. I think if I act for the first time, I have to be safe. I thought it was a crowded place. I was so worried. I was worried. I think so. I have a question. When you performed with many people around you, did you feel safe? Do you feel comfortable? How often did you perform? From 2000 to 3000. That's outside. How did you feel? When you performed, did you feel like you wanted to be in the right place? I felt it at first, but not when I was on stage. It was not a pressure to me. It was a pressure to me. So it was a bit of a pressure to me. You said that before you performed, you felt like you wanted to be safe when you were with him. When I performed, I felt that every time I performed, I felt that I was different. Sometimes I can beat them, sometimes I can be more dangerous, sometimes I can be more guilty. Sometimes I can choose a safe way. If not too much, I can be more confident. Although we rarely have the chance to try, but why do we have the chance to try? Because in life, the level of the high level of the high level is also high. For example, we have many more people who are more active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world.

We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We have a lot of people who are active in the world. We are very clear about the design of a view long. A comparison between the artist view long and the art of the factory. I am the second student of the Japanese art gallery. Now we will start drawing the view long. We have two works about the view long. A work from a student who studies art and Japanese art. We have two different works. After 23 years of playing the guitar, have you ever painted this guitar? No. Which one? I've never painted it before. A friend who doesn't study guitar, but can be connected and look at the guitar, can paint it. Why 23 years? Do you know the history of the guitar? Yes. I don't know much about it. What is the most special thing about the guitar? It's the guitar that I can say it's like a human being, like my voice. Is the guitar you play special? Very special. How? It's a very old guitar, many years. From 1680, it's more than 400 years old. I bought it, it's not as good as it is now. Because it's very long, no one plays it. The guitar is like that, but if it's long, it won't be able to be called. The more you play, the more you will be like yourself. For example, there are famous bands, as well as famous artists, like Isaac Stam, Strativarius. He gave that band to the main musician, where I was admitted to the job. After he took that band, I was very touched and very happy when he gave me that band. But I couldn't play that band. When I pulled the guitar, I realized that it was the voice of the man who was playing the saxophone. I couldn't play it. And the guitar was there. Because if I played it for a long time, it would be more effective. It's the voice of each person. Through the guitar, you may know that artists are all very special and their own. But you say that the more you play, the more you are like yourself. I don't know if you like to play the guitar. It's a bit dangerous, but the band has been playing a lot of songs and have become a living being. And I also have a lot of proof that I am a young man. And I have had a lot of my life, and I have studied abroad and decided to return to Vietnam. Trust the young people. Trust the young people. Let's create more things for the young people. And don't worry too much about... If they have any bad things, just leave them and be a young man. The last sentence, the artist, the artist, has sent it to me. He said that he believes in young people like me. He said it in his own way. Before saying goodbye, I would like to say goodbye to the next show of Vân Tây. There will be a very special Vân Tây show, a guest is a famous singer of Vietnam, singer Tran Thu Ha. Goodbye and see you again."

I think it's a good idea that we have a president who doesn't have a president who is a smart and smart person. But with all the Diti's votes, there's no such thing as a small party in the Pai region. To use the situation of the Pai region, you don't have to go to see the Netanyahu show. You can still see it very, very, very well. But to be smart, you can film under the roof, you can film under the TV. You always fight, maybe you'll give me a chance to tell you and it looks good and you feel it in your mouth. Eat the girl, but don't. Tara Netanyahu, I think she's very brave. She's a girl that we love so much to get along, and not that she's a girl who's both different, I hope she won't be in a fight after the... ...technical. But I think they'll tell her many times in the show, they'll cut to the end of the story. and she's more active in the government. I really liked her thoughts. She was always so mature in the years of the 60s, throughout the years. I think she was the first woman with the style of a monster. I think that in the end, our Israeli culture is very similar to the Russian women in the Arabian language. And maybe from the beginning, we don't have here the Russian woman in the Muslim language."

This demo demonstrates how to make Excel multiply and divide. Also refer to http://www.kalmstrom.com/Tips/ExcelFormulas2.htm,"Microsoft Excel (Software), Excel forumlas, kalmstrom.com demo, divide in Excel, multiply in Excel, kalmstrom.com tutorial",260,2,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/JfCc-wFBe-g.mp3,"I'm Peter Kalmström of Kalmström.com Business Solutions. In this demonstration I'll show you how to calculate your home costs. Something that every homeowner should really know how to do. I'll show you how to do that from scratch here in Excel 2013. But everything that I'm showing here can also be used on earlier versions of Excel. As you see I've filled out some of the information. I have the financing costs and the other yearly cost here. And I just have to fill in these formulas. and do the math here. So I'm going to start with the home tax and of course the home tax is the same as property tax here and it's based on the home value. So as usual when you're doing a formula in Excel you need to start with entering the equals sign that tells Excel that the following is something to be calculated as something that Excel should do the math on. So I'm going to do the property tax here is the home value multiplied by the property tax. And as you see Excel 2013 here is showing these numbers and I'm multiplying by using the star symbol here. And then I'm just going to press enter and of course I get the sum there. I'm going to continue with the next formula that's very similar to the previous one. The interest is the loan amount multiplied by the interest rate. Again I'm entering the equals sign and doing the loan amount multiplied by the interest The repayment should of course be the repayment of the loan. The repayment is of course the equals again the loan amount divided by and that's a forward slash I'm using there for the division sign and the loan term is 40 years so that makes me calculate that I have to repay here 20,000 per year during those four years. And the other cost, I've added a little arrow here to show that those are the yearly cost here. So I'm going to do equals here. Another several different ways of doing this one. You can do the simplest one with just pluses and just do that one plus this one. But of course that becomes rather long and tedious after a while, so I'm going to do another one. I'm going to tell Excel to do a sum of the numbers here. Equals sum of the numbers. and from this cell, colon, which means 2, that cell. So calculate the sum of b11 to b16. So that's doing there. Calculate the sum of b11 to b16. I'm going to do the same thing here now with a total. That's going to be the total of these three. And again, I can do the same thing. Calculate the sum of these three. and as you see E4 to E6. I'm going to actually cancel that now by pressing the Escape key on the keyboard and show you another way of doing that. That's using this Auto Sum button right there. And if I click that now I get a suggestion, but as you see that suggestion is all wrong. So I actually need to correct that suggestion by simply clicking on the correct cells. So that's two different ways of doing it. Let me show you a third way of doing the same thing here. There's actually a sum function guide up here, which you can use to just insert a function and now I already have the sum in there. If I started from scratch, let's delete that again, pressing the delete key on the keyboard, just pressing the function. And as you see now, I can find a list of all the functions that are available in Excel and there's a huge amount of functions available. And depending on how much math you know, you'll probably find a lot of them that are are useful for whatever math you want to do. But I'm just going to do the sum here, which is the simplest one really. Sum. And here I can just do the numbers that I want to do a sum of. This dialogue is slightly different than most dialogues because you can actually select information behind the dialogue. That's very useful. So that's how the function wizard works. Now for the monthly costs, which is of course also an interesting information to know. You want to do a division again. You want to divide the year values by 12. In most cases I recommend not entering any values like that because they might change in the future. But in this case we can be relatively certain that the number of months in a year will not change anytime soon. So we can type in the 12 in that case. Now I'm going to do the same thing for the next one. The one to the left divided by 12 again. So you see these are the same things and Excel actually knows that. So by default Excel uses something called relative references. So this formula here, e4 divided by 12 is actually read out by Excel as the cell to the left divided by 12. So now if I copy this formula here, just copy that and paste it down here. You see the formula is e5 the cell to the left divided by 12. And I can fill this down and that's of course the same thing as copying the formula down two more times. you see now the cell to the left divided by 12. Same thing here, the cell to the left divided by 12. Of course this one I don't need, so I'm going to remove that one. Now we're actually done with the formula part of this demonstration but I do want to tidy this up a bit more and one thing that I want to do is make sure that this actually looks like mounts. So I'm going to select the cells and then just change the number format to dollars in this case and then decrease the number of decimals. Again, I'm selecting the cell, changing the dollar formats and decreasing the decimals like that. Now that I've done that a couple of times, I can actually copy that format to this button. I can click on it and just click the next cell here. As you see, it copies the format, both the dollar value and the number of decimals that we want, zero. I can do that now with all of these. One way to do it is, of course, to paint over all of them like that. Another one that's rather cool is you can actually double click this button, the Format Painter. Now that's stuck, so I can go ahead and click these, all the ones that I want. Same thing for all of these. Now of course you see it's still a Format Painter here. To get out of that mode you do, escape the escape key. Now I'm not in the Format Painter anymore. Another thing that you might want to do is distinguish those values that you might want to change. from the ones that you should change if something changes in your calculation here. This one and all of these were formulas in the beginning. I would recommend using the cell styles and there are actually cell styles that are already defined here. This is a calculation, right? So I'm going to go ahead and change that one and all of these two calculations. Same thing with the other values here. They're not calculations, they're inputs. So I'll go ahead and change that to input. right there and same thing with all these inputs. That makes it very obvious for everybody what can be changed and what should be changed. This concludes this demonstration. Thank you for watching.","I'm Peter Kalmström of Kalmström.com Business Solutions. In this demonstration I'll show you how to calculate your home costs.

Soy Pedro Atroche de comentar de este gameplay informativo después del parche 5.2. Espero que os guste e intentará hacer una serie explicando cada una de las clases. Empezaremos por la mía, ya que es la que yo conozco y la que a mí me interesa. Después iré haciendo el deca, el hunter, etcétera. A poco a poco, uno cada semana más o menos. O sea que ya estaré atento y os dejo de fondo con arenas, estas son antes del parche 5.2, de aquí una semana que saldrán el miércoles, saldrán las arenas, podremos hacer y entonces haré más arenas después del parche 5.2, espero que os guste el gameplay de fondo. Bien, vamos a explicar la información del parche 5.2 de sacerdote. Primero, se han reducido los talentos de Malinco, y el reto de alivio y la coraza espiritual era la rotación típica que se utilizaba en el jugador contra entorno sobre todo en pv y se notaba mucho el disciplina que estaba muy subido de sanación En PVE se veía más a un Disciplina que a un Sagrado, y entonces la clase de Sagrado queda un poco retrocedida. Por tanto, se han hecho los cambios del parche 5-2 para que el Disciplina en juego contra jugador, que era inexistente como Hitler, pueda introducirse de nuevo como antes, como antaño. Y entonces el Sagrado en PVE coja un relieve más importante y pueda cogerse un sitio. ¿Cómo se ha aburrido la rotación de sacerdote? ¿Qué pasa con rezo de alivio? y que han hecho con los otros ataques, por ejemplo, penitencias la han mejorado y han reducido su tiempo de reutilización, ahora es de 9 segundos, ya que es un ataque bastante divertido, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede hacer, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se puede, que es un ataque que se suele utilizar, que era típico del sacerdote de disciplina y había quedado un poco ahí marginado, ¿no? Entonces se ha mejorado y ahora se puede utilizar ya como un ataque bastante útil. La sanación en sí, la sanación ha aumentado un 25% en disciplina, en disciplina y en sagrado. En sombra han sufrido unos pequeños cambios en cuáles han reducido su sanación, ya que eran insuperables en PUBP y en PUE. y que eran bastante potentes y entonces que han hecho reducir su sanación y también afectan al glifo de la pua mental ya que ahora los instantáneos no están beneficiados de aquel daño extra que de aquel glifo han reducido el glifo y ahora solo es cuando cuando la pua mental la echamos no es cuando es instantánea sino cuando la casteamos entonces se beneficia del glifo y que más en la sanación relampa de todo tipo de clases se ha reducido su mana para que sea un ataque también bastante útil para hacer dote ya era útil creo yo desde mi punto de vista era un ataque muy útil pues ahora todavía lo es más ahora menos mana por lo tanto pues nos saldrá mejor utilizarlo espero que os haya gustado el vídeo hasta aquí si me he dejado algo me lo envíais lo ponéis en los comentarios o me envíais un mensaje privado a youtube Espero les haya gustado, like favoritos y acordados de suscribiros para ver más. Adiós.","Hello everyone, I'm Pedro Atochede, commenting this informative gameplay after Part 5.2 I hope you like it, I will try to make a series explaining each of the classes, we will start with mine, since it is the one I know and the one that interests me, then I will do the DK, the Hunter, etc. little by little, one every week more or less, that is, I will be attentive I leave you with the arena, these are before the patch 5.2, from here a week, that will be released on Wednesday, the arena will be released, we can do it and then I will make more arena after the patch 5.2, I hope you like the gameplay of the background. Well, let's explain the information of patch 5.2 of SacerDote. The difference between the sacred and the PVE is more to a discipline than a sacred and then the sacred class is a bit retrographed. Therefore, the changes of the patch 5.2 have been made so that the discipline in the game against the player who was inexistent as a healer can introduce itself again as before, as before, and then the sacred PVE takes a more important relief and can take a place. The rotation of the priest is boring, the same thing as the spiritual heart, but the relief. How have these changes been made? The spiritual heart is no longer a master's benefit. When you make the spiritual heart, the mastery does not increase its effect. And it has also suffered some small changes of 50% or something like that. What happens with Alivio's network? It reduces the damage we receive. But the Alivio's effect is not that it increases our healing when it is not critical. That is, when we throw it, the buff doesn't come out so that our healing increases the objective. What have they done with the other attacks? For example, Penitence has improved it and they have reduced its time of re-use. Now it's 9 seconds, since it's a pretty fun attack. The healing has increased 25% in discipline, in shadow and in sacred. and they were very powerful. So they have reduced their health and also affect the glyph of the mental lung, since now the instantanians are not benefited from that extra damage from that glyph. They have reduced the glyph and now it's only when the mental lung is added, it's not when it's instantanian, but when we cast it, then it's benefited from the glyph. And what else? In the relapse healing I hope you liked the video, if you leave me something, send it to me, put it in the comments or send me a private message to youtube I hope you liked it, favorite like and subscribe to see more, bye!"

We've been here since my grandfather came here in 1914. He was a mob of sheep and he intended to do cropping. I started in 1979 and here we are in 2012 still with sheep and cropping although things have changed a little bit since then. We now have 1,500 hectares in total farm size and running approximately 1200 years with follows after that 1000 weathers and lambs self-replacing marine uplock we crop 70% of the farm approximately every year and that is in a rotation of canola and lupin canola and wheat with wheat now becoming the break crop for canola the way it's shaping up over the last three years we also have a legume break in the middle of the cropping phase which at the moment consists of olive clover and we have a pasture phase of loosened and sub clover. Some other emphasis from our farm has been on revegetation sites and managing remnant vegetation. So since about the mid 90s we've done an extensive farm plan with wind breaks and fencing out the railway line which was part of a bigger landcare project and replanting that with many indigenous species to this area. So in the last 15, 20 years we've planted a lot of trees on this farm, although it probably doesn't look like it. We're standing here. And we've had a fair emphasis on sustainable farming in the way we approach our cropping in zero tillage and keeping stubble and keeping ground cover on the ground all the time. So we've established our native seed orchid, under the help of Greening Australia. So for the last six or seven years I've been collecting native seed off my orchard. That seed is then sent to the CMA, to the seed bank in Deniliquin. Plus I have a private client who buys my native seed. So that's been another thing that we've developed on our property. I'm collecting grams and Peter's harvesting tons. So there's a bit of a difference between the two. 20 year plan in the early 90s we undertook to build some contour banks and waterways and that directed the water flow over the farm. Contour banks fell into the waterways and the waterways fell into dams. We've basically covered all our farms with that now and protected the farm land for floods and wet winters which you don't often get those. The name it's lost to get back on the paddock We're standing in a paddock of our lead clover at the moment. We use our lead clover as a brake pop to see your rotation and your fopping rotation. In the background you'll see some Muno yuz, pastura blood. We tend to benchmark our sheep, Craig Wilson's weather trials at Tumora. That's for the genetic progress that we make. towards the ecology and the conservation of trees and creating room of vegetation areas by direct seeding and tube stop. Whereas I'm more focused on the profitability of the farm, the agronomy aspects of cropping and the sheep husbandry aspects. We both believe that profit maximisation is the aim of a family.","My name is Peter Campbell, I'm in my wife Alison and we've just been awarded the Nusrah-Wiles Farmer of the Year which is an incredible honour to us.

Okay, so excuse me. I'll type this out and we should be all good. I'm just actually going to copy this, paste a few times. This should have been a pound. Okay. And two, three, four. Okay. So now we have four items under our list item in an unordered list itself. And what you're going to see here is when we refresh this you'll see something that you may not expect to have happen Refresh this it's going first item one item two item three item four And then second third last if you notice item four is even bold So what's happening here? It's that because in our CSS If we scroll down here We said the list items In nav, we'll display inline, also the last child of the list items will have a font weight of bold. We didn't say which list item, we specifically said list items under the class of nav. Well, there's list items here, but these are also technically list items under the class of nav. To build a drop down menu, let's say we want these main level links listed horizontally on the top. want these listed vertically. We don't want these to be displayed in line. So how can we solve this? Well, we can solve this with the child selector. And what that is, is it's greater than sign like this. And it's really pointing, right? So it's saying that the children of the nav that are list items display in line. And you know what it's not going to do, it's not going to give this property to list items that are children of list items. Just list items that are children of the nav directly. So let's save this and let's refresh our page. And now you'll see that underneath first is here is all four of our items and then the other ones are display inline as well. Of course, since we haven't really styled this, it's kind of funky right now. But what's really important is that you only affected this first level list items. And again, if we wanted to style list items underneath this, we could then We're going to say list items under the navigation under a UL and then another LI. We're going to give them a background of blue. Let's save this and let's come to our page and refresh this. Okay, so now these items that are children of the list. which are then children of the ULLI have a background of blue. And thus if we were to add another list in one of these items, those would not be affected by this code either. So this can come in really handy if you're trying to affect certain pieces of code. It's a nice way to just affect only the children of an element. Another example would say if we want to only affect links that are children of the paragraphs. We could say all links and paragraph all the anchors in a paragraph are going to be font weight bold. Now we refresh this we could see this is HTML5 is bold but none of these are. In fact this last is only bold because we're telling you to from our last child. So that's the child selector and it's going to come in really handy in a second and the next tutorial when we go over how to make an actual drop-down menu using only CSS. As always, if you have any questions, leave a comment in the video, hit us up at Twitter, level up Tuts. My name is Scott and thanks for watching.","Hey, this is Scott with Lola Tuts and today I'm gonna show you how to use the child selector in CSS and this is gonna become really important because in the next lesson I'm gonna teach you how to make a drop-down menu using only CSS and the child selector So it's good to understand these concepts before we do this that way instead of just you know reproducing what you're seeing you're knowing what you're doing and why okay so to get started the first thing I'm going to do is add another you order list into this list item in our navigation. So let's go to our HTML and right here. Let's see it's our nav and what I'm going to do is right after the anchor before the ally.

So when we think of written reports, we think about documentation. And just exactly what is the need for documentation? Why do we do it? Obviously it's a historical record. It provides information for all of the users of the report, of which there are many, and people will have different reasons for reading that report. So what we want to do is take a look at how that report and documentation can aid us in getting C-level approval. We also want to look at the other purposes for a report. One of the reasons of course is to signpost to give directions. It is the clearest way to guide. Sometimes documentation is not clear. So when everyone knows what the rules are, they're forced to abide by them. Don't let anyone say I didn't do everything for the company. So if you'll complete that exercise now. model is actually developed in Toronto at the Ontario Institute for Studies and Education. It looks at how the human mind processes information. If we understood how the human mind processes information, could we structure our communication in a way that facilitates that, that makes it easier for people to understand? You can see at the top of the process of understanding model we see the messages, the various barriers to the receptor to actually hearing the message. These are the things that we talked about in the first level lesson around communication, background noise, feeling hungry or the room too hot that makes it a barrier to listening. Once we've heard the message, the message goes into an area of our brain, metaphorically speaking of course, called the decision maker. And here we make a decision. And the decision is, will I listen or will I not? This is the reason that we have headlines in newspapers why our opening statements are so, so important. The listener makes a decision, a conscious decision, will I listen or will I not? For a C-level presentation, of course you want to make sure that you hit them early with the reason and capture their attention. I'll show you a typical opening in a moment. Then once we've tuned in or the listeners tuned in, the message goes into short-term memory. If I say something you actually hold it in your short-term memory for about five to six seconds. It is than lost, unless it can be put into long-term memory, put into a frame of reference that you understand. And so you're constantly hearing what I'm saying, trying to make it make sense for you in the context of your long-term memory. The challenge of course, everybody's long-term memory is different. So different interpretations are taken. The process of understanding model leads us to the communications planning guide. The communications planning guide is in your text. It's a very structured way to plan your communication. I'm going to walk through the essentials of it in a moment. It will help you to structure the message. It'll help you identify a communication objective, analyze the audience. And I think Taylor, the communication using the principles of the process of understanding model to be much more effective. People tell me as well that it actually reduces their preparation time as well because it gives them a format to follow. So let's look at the communications planning guide. First part is around your communication objective. First of all, the action. action the customer is required to take as a result of the communication. Most people start the communications by saying, well, what do I want to tell these people? No, turn it around. What action is the customer required to take as a result of this communication? So if we understand what action we want the customer to take, our next step would be what are the benefits to the customer in taking this action? So the customer, the listener should be able to say, what's in it for me? And that gives you gives them a reason to listen. You're talking to the decision-maker part if you recall the process of understanding a model. So what's the action? What's in it for me? Next bit, is it achievable? Can the customer realistically take this action with the one communication? Sometimes we bite off more than we can chew. That was the case in with Philip wasn't it? He tried to get too much in one meeting. He should have just been saying, and here could we have agreement that we have a problem and the next time we'll talk about next steps or whatever. And the last step is straightforward. Is it measurable? How will success be measured? So I don't think there's any point in having quote a status meeting to give information. You'll want them to do something at the end that's how we started with the action. And so is it measurable? It's measurable if they take that action at the end of the communication. So for us the objective of this report and the presentation is to get sign off. So everything that we do in terms of deciding on content has to be related to that objective. So One thing we do is we analyze the audience and you know it's a bit of a euphemism know your audience. What is it that we're really trying to do there? Consider this what we really want to ask is what do they know now and what do they need to know in order to take the action that we want them to take. That's difference between those two is the contents of your presentation. or nothing less. Of course there will be obstacles and solutions which are already well versed at handling. And of course some of the other things, what's their general background in terms of technology or what are their needs, their need for control or success, and their attitude towards business architecture to the project to you personally, all things to keep in mind when you're structuring your presentation.","Canada, let's talk about communications and written reports.

I don't get a joke or anything like that. Let me know when you're ready. I'll tell a joke. Did you hear about the guy who lost his entire left side in a car accident? He's all right now. Let me know when we're all set. So my name is Matt Knopf from Ply Media and I'm joined up on stage with Gal Klein. He's our CTO and resident genius. His title might change depending on how the demo goes. But hey Gal, let me know when we're all set to get going. Gal, are you all ready? Okay. So again, my name's Matt Knopf from Ply Media and Ply Media Media is the leader in providing captions and subtitles for online video We've been around for three years. We're back by Greylock where headquarters in Palo Alto We have offices our offices in Israel and the past three years we've been helping Fortune 500 companies with some time in caption on multi language subtitles as well for their online video now this video has been on demand But today we're very proud to announce the availability of live captioning for online video And for those of you in the audience, you might not have seen that. Let's go ahead and bring up the tech crunch real time video. So this is what our audience is seeing. So they've actually been using our product for the past three or four hours. There's actually live captioning of this event going on right now. So there you go. So just a caveat here. There is some latency between what you folks in the audience are seeing and what you're going to see on screen. So this is this is more of a life online video feed So some of the benefits of providing caption are obvious there's 36 million in that for Hard of hearing Americans in the you know in this country many more abroad so obviously live captioning makes Live streaming available to them and also type media helps organizations become compliant with federal regulations on this fund also live captioning helps office workers. So I'm sure many people, you know, it's Friday, we're screwing around and watching the TechFront event. So for those folks who are working instead of watching the TechFront event and doing so discreetly, you're welcome. Now in addition, I just mentioned two domestic audiences. What what Plight Media can also do is help live broadcasters with reaching international audiences. So, why don't you go ahead and show some of the folks. If you look up here in the, there's going to be a bit of a latency here, but you can actually go to the drop down and choose the language that you want to view. So for this presentation we've got three other languages besides English, but we could have done more. The point is that before this conference and other conferences like this would only reach English speaking audiences. Now you can reach audiences around the world. So we think this is a a game changing feature. We think this is really, really cool. So I've mentioned some of the benefits of live captioning and we're going to show you some more. We've actually built a demo for this conference. So Cal, do you want to go ahead and bring up the live e-mail? So if you look over at the right hand side, you'll see captions of what I'm saying now. You can see very quick and very accurate. And what we'd like to do is show you an example of Twitter integration. So you can actually, let's say I was gonna say something profound like, Watson come here, I want you or something like that. Something tweet worthy. I'll go ahead and show these folks, pull one of the captions and tweet it out. So what you could actually do is I could actually tweet this entire conference or my speech or just one line of caption. So there you can see if you look at supplies, Twitter page where the caption was just uploaded online there. So that's one feature. Another feature, if you look at the bottom right of the screen, you'll see automatic tag. So if I were to say important keywords like locations or important celebrities like President Barack Obama or Michael Errington or Eric Schoenfeld, they would appear in the information tags eventually. And so you can see down right are some of the tags or some keywords that on that crunch page for the deck this morning so you can see that at the top were I think Jason had started to do some of his transcripts with the real things at the bottom so Jason and I, he might be out of a job here. So the point is here, this helps bolster natural search rankings. It also helps events live forever. So a video feed, you know, a live video feed comes and goes but this document's gonna stay here forever and it's gonna help with natural search. And so I know when you're thinking a lot of you are probably saying okay, how are you doing this so quickly and so accurately and the secret is The secret is Denise so Denise is a professional captioner she can type upwards of 340 words per minute which is crazy But the point is that we're partnering with NCRA certified companies to help enterprises deliver the type of high accuracy that automation can't deliver. So this manual captioning is the best way to provide the high quality and high accuracy that enterprises demand. And the solution is scalable. The professional captioner does not have to be on site. They can be distributed around the world. So it's a very scalable solution. And so the translations are automated, the multiple language subtitles. premium service that's available to our partners and we like to make two announcements before we close. One is that we've brought on a series of partners to help distribute this product. One of course is Ustream who did a fantastic job today delivering the captions for this event. We're also bringing on Live Stream who's actually announcing their service and going live today. We're also bringing on Rideco, Kotura, Digital, Kite and Ujala as well. And we're very excited that they've chosen us to deliver this solution to customers and finally some really exciting news. Climedia has just signed an agreement with the Wall Street Journal Digital Network to provide live captioning for their daily show, The News Hub. Thank you.","I don't get a joke or anything like that. Let me know when we're all set. So my name is Matt Knopf from Ply Media and I'm joined up on stage with Gal Klein.

Thanks for checking out my YouTube channel. I just wanted to get a first video out there just to say hello to everybody and just let you know a little bit about myself. I just decided to do this raw food diet. Today is my day five. I cut out caffeine today. Not as happy as yesterday, but I know like once I get over this it'll be fine. I just wanted to tell you a little bit how I came on I've been following the life regenerator for about two years and he's really inspired me to do the raw food diet. Just seeing the glow that he has and the other people have that I've met that just do eat raw food. They live raw. It just seems amazing to me. And that's where I want my life to be. That in practicing yoga, I mean, within the past five days I felt so much change within me. Just the way I feel. my attitude, the way um, just there's no more anger or anything. Emotions have changed completely and my thought process has changed. And this is just the beginning for me so I'm really, really looking forward to all the different changes that are going to be happening. I basically why I want to do videos on YouTube is maybe to inspire other people. I have been inspired I want to put my videos out there and show recipes that I'm practicing with and experimenting different things and let everybody know how my journey is going and how I'm doing with it and if I can inspire someone that would be great because being inspired by someone that has that's going through the same thing that you're going to be going through, I think it's great. You can always go back to people on YouTube. There are videos, there are first videos that I'm going to show you. when they start things, you can see that they were in that position two once. Everybody starts somewhere and you can start today. You can start tomorrow but don't put things off. Don't keep putting things off in your life. This is your life. You only have this moment. So if you really want to do something, get out there and do it. Make that decision to change. I have been wanting to do this for well over a year and I made the decision a while ago I was a vegetarian for four years. I felt a lot better. But once I started going back to meats and everything cooked foods and everything, I just... I could tell. I wasn't feeling it's great. But it's, you know, at the time you think, oh I don't want to sacrifice. I don't want to do this. When I go out with my friends, they're eating this or they're drinking this. It's like, it doesn't matter. Really what matters is your health and how you feel and what you want to do with your life. If this is something you want to do, get out there and do it. You know, I feel great right now. and I feel like too much is going to change. I already feel my body is a lot better already. I've lost 4 pounds in the past. This is day 5, so... And I don't feel like I'm losing weight, like trying to lose it. I'm eating plenty of calories. I'm not cutting any calories or anything like I'm trying to drop weight. I'm just switching over to this lifestyle and I'm feeling really good. So thanks for checking out my channel. and I'm gonna get some more videos up here soon. I only have the video on my phone right now, the video on my laptop. The quality isn't as good as I was hoping, so. Alright, well have a great day, peace, thanks for watching.","Hi everybody, I'm Kate. Thanks for checking out my YouTube channel.

We took him to the ER and they sent us home. Then we took him to the dr's office and they scheduled us an appointment for the next day because his blood count was high, The next day the dr noticed his groin area was swollen and suspected a hernia and possible bowel obstruction. We rushed to the closest children's hospital for surgery. You can imagine our shock when the surgeon came out after surgery and informed us that his appendix had ruptured over a week prior to the operation. It was a miracle that he survived. He never even showed signs of being in pain. They then informed us that he had a rare condition called Amyand's hernia that caused his appendix to rupture and the infection created the hernia. This condition only happens 0.1% in children. He is the 31st child to have his operation and condition documented. We were released with a PICC line. This is a catheter/ iv inserted into a major artery in his heart. We gave him antibiotics at home for 2 uneventful weeks. When the PICC line was removed, the fever came back. His blood count was 40,000! We were admitted to another hospital closer to home. He had developed sepsis. The infection was in his blood stream.

And usually I get him on the floor so that he can't fall off of anything in case he spins around on me. And I cover him with a towel so that he can't see my fingers to grab with his mouth. And just to calm him down and relax him, he can bite into the towel if he wants. Now I inspect his toes and feet. and of course he doesn't like this too much, but he allows me to do it as long as I stay with cutting the very tips of his claws and don't get into the quick where it's going to hurt. Now, after I get done with the back legs, I move on to the front legs, which he especially does not like me grabbing, but as long as I go slow, he'll let me pull those out from under him and we get him out here. I inspect all of his toes and his claws, the claw. So I hope you learned something and to those of you who requested a claw cutting video, I hope this helps you.

Specifically, look for a target. Something on the wall or something in a mirror, something that you can actually shoot for. If you can pick that target, you're more likely going to hit the target with a sword and your potted and you see it's all a real, it's all a one-concept. trying to separate sparring, pattern, shield, make it all one concept, pick the target and hit that target. And the second reason that I find that you may not necessarily kick and hide, doing patterns, kicking in the air, you're not really making contact with anything. So some people are afraid that they might pull a bottle over and shoot themselves because they're just kicking nothing. For example, when you actually hit something, there's a little bit of force to give it back to you. to be a little bit safer, at least in the constant vibe, in some constant vibes.

No sé si el mercado ¿La decisión es tratar de ver sostenerla en el tiempo con estos valores y las condiciones externas acompañan el mercado? con respecto al precio de ayer, los aceites están casi 22 dólares arriba, lo único que está un poco difícil de lograr ubicar son las harinas, pero bueno, es como todo, cuando todo sube mucho por ahí cuesta vender afuera, pero por eso consideramos que todos los números que se están manejando y los márgenes que estarían teniendo la industria aceitera, es muy probable que ese precio pudiera ser alcanzado.

Exactly, let's say that is a price that I suppose is very expected by the producers in general, the offer in recent times was very retracted due to the permanent stocks that have had the Chicago market and well within that level of value is a very important offer. That is why we came out to offer, given that we consider that it is given the conditions so that it can be paid, I do not know if the market will achieve to enable or accept this value but well we believe that conditions are given so that it can be made. The decision is to try to sustain it in time with these values and external conditions with the market? Look, the market Chicago has been favoring us for a long time and today we continue to have a market with a fairly important stock, the international demand continues to be obvious at this moment I think it was up to nine dollars on top the price of yesterday, the oil is almost 22 dollars above, the only thing that is a little difficult to find are the sands, but hey, it is like everything when everything rises a lot, it is difficult to sell outside, but that is why we consider that all the numbers that are being handled and the margins that the oil industry is having is very likely that that price could be reached, I do not know if later in the time that it was happening will be complied, supposedly the standards are still firm, but today we believe that a valuable value to get, regardless of whether it is achieved or not."

Importante el respaldo que está teniendo en la provincia de Buenos Aires lo va a tener en todo el país y bueno, poder estar acá en Malvina en este polideportivo de la cooperativa de tortuguitas con clubes no solo de Malvina, sino de Escobar, con clubes de Tigre, con clubes de Pilar, de San Miguel. Esto lo hace, obviamente, nos familiariza un poquito más. Pero en realidad la respuesta es masiva, el trabajo de las instituciones como lo venía diciendo que vienen realizando ese asombroso. Y este Estado Nacional presente a través de la figura de Cristina y el Ministerio que conduce Alicia Keener, junto con la Secretaría de Deporte, poder ayudarlo para hacer realidad esos sueños que son los sueños de nuestros hijos. Que hemos lanzado la diplomatura en deporte social que le permita al técnico del Clube Barrio diplomarse. que es un convenio con la Universidad de Avellaneda, va a durar 8 meses, ese curso y son 3 veces de la semana. También la capacitación para técnicos de Clube Barrio, estamos terminando el hotel que donde hicimos el salón para capacitar a los técnicos de Clube Barrio en Mázvig, Escobar, la ministra pidió que se construya un hotel y estamos a 2 meses de terminar ese hotel con 100 plazas que va a ser para los chicos de todo el país.

So, in this way, we are trying to be close to the people who work. The back-up that the Buenos Aires province is having and will have throughout the country is important. And being here in Malvina, in this sports community of the Tortunitas Cooperative, concludes not only in Malvina, but also in Escobar, The National State is now working with the Ministry of Sports and the Ministry of Sports to help the children achieve their dreams. We are finishing the hotel where we made the living room to accommodate the neighborhood technicians in MAHWICH. Escobar asked the minister to build a hotel and we are two months from now to finish the hotel with 100 seats, which will be for the kids of the entire country. Néstor Kirchner has made a concrete effort, a different country, a better country. And being the protagonist of these events, what has to do with social sport, I think it is a great opportunity to talk about the future of the neighborhood. I'm going to do it"

When Martin was telling us to come into dinner, did you all see him up there? I'm glad I'm hearing you out of the room. I told him I said, Martin, you look like a whistle lady up there. Don't ever do that again. Thank you for doing this interview. Sparing me to speak. I think I will actually. All my life, I wanted to do the question asked. Good evening Mr. President and welcome to Israel. We here are accustomed to the business of American leaders before the day to late or while in office especially when they have something to do here on emergency call. You are generous enough to come after leaving office and we are grateful for that. If you have any ambition to run for office I know it's a big shape. to run for office again. You will get a left line even before the opening of the palace. Now we used to say follow the sun to its way. Instead let's follow the problems. Well, we prefer to say that the image of the United States in the world is of a weakening power. Is it a matter of image of public relations or a historic milestone, the end of the American century and the beginning of the century, when we reach America? We have a secondary role. countries at very high levels of approval with enormously positive press coverage and people like the fact that we have a president who looks more like the world. He's not just our first African American president but his father was born in Kenya and he had a stepfather from Indonesia. He lived in the world's biggest Muslim country for many years and I think he's doing pretty well and the Secretary of State is fairly popular for sure. So I think we're going to be able to But you asked a serious question about America, we can look at Iron Commons week now, but we still have the biggest economy in the world. And I think that there was a brief period, as I used to tell my fellow Americans, after the Cold War, when we were the world's only military, economic, and political superpower. That period could not be seen as a political period. not last very long. For one thing, if you believe that intelligence is equally distributed throughout the world, it was only a matter of time until the nations with bigger populations and us catch up to us in good and bad ways, both in gross national product and greenhouse gas emissions, and eventually in higher per capita.

Agora, o Fashion, estamos nós, né? Com por denses, com torcionismo. Isso aí até parece uma aula de yoga, Mariana, que loucura, hein? Quase lá. Isso aí é tortura total e a cobra. Não, não.

Se vá prova. Oi Luciana, oi Super Pop, tudo bem? Eu me chamo de Zé Lequenge. profissional da dança do ventre, principalmente no estilo egípcio. Eu vou mostrar pra vocês um pouquinho do que é que eu sei fazer. Não dá pra mostrar tudo, mas eu vou mostrar um pouquinho e não é fácil não. Vamos lá? Você precisa ter muita técnica, mas a sensualidade é um ponto muito forte nessa dança. Algumas dicas pro pessoal do palco não fazer feio. Primeira dica, movimento dico-adril. Vamos lá. Ponha o pezinho no chão e tiro o canhar do chão. Fica com a batatinha apoiada. vou só flexionar o meu joelho quando meu joelho flexiona com essa perna também flexionada o meu quadril encaixa aqui e nisso as moedinhas se movimentam e o seu quadril também mais uma dica vamos lá vou manter minha perna aqui e vou as duas flexionadas essa eu vou manter essa eu vou alongar olha só o pezinho não sai do lugar Eu só trabalho o meu quadril. Agora eu vou dar uns movimentos bem sexes e ondulatórios, tá? Vou mostrar os meus dois joelhos para vocês. Olha só, estou mostrando os meus dois joelhos para vocês, né? Olha só, eu subo essa perna e relaxo. Eu subo a outra e relaxo. Esse movimento contínuo faz com que eu tenha uma movimentação lateral do meu quadril. Aí a saia esconde as pernas, que é o grande segredo da dança onde está sem solidade é não mostrar e olha só ó posso fazer isso também com a perna afastada ó mesma técnica sobe relaxa sobe relaxa sobe relaxa sobe relaxa aqui tenta ficar fixa ó trabalha só embaixo e a mãozinha acompanhando aí uma mão vem escorrega pelo corpo e a outra ponta a ponta para sua empresa que está na sua frente. Se você quiser melhorar a situação, eu vou dar mais um. O que você faz aqui, você faz aqui. Trabalha só aqui. E se você conseguir, olha só. Trabalha só o abdômen. E a mãozinha. Você mistura, gente. O grande lance está na sensualidade. A sensualidade não está em você mostrar. Está em você sem só o esconder, brincar. Daí tirar! Daí tirar! É brincadeira! A vida é um jogo, é isso aí! para a grande vencedora. Vamos lá! Essa prova vale 200. Outro que eu ia fazer com a cobra. Era a saída dele ainda, velho.

This is the total torture. And the cover. No, no, I want to see the cover. She's doing... I'm crazy when she's doing the cover of the cover. You know that cover is already popo. Is he nice? If I bite this animal, I swear I'll bite it back. He's gonna do it only? Is he poisonous? No, he kills by the lightning. And he has popo? Ah, it would be here, down here, even if you see. And open it. Don't open it, you little one. Why open it? When he eats any food, he can open his mouth 3 times the diameter of his mouth. So he eats a rat like this. But we look at his nose. It's cute, look. Look, I like snakes, but this one is a little big. I'll go for it. Roberto, stop, Roberto. I want to know if you can put your hand on the snake. Then it complicated, right? Is there a fear of a snake, Roberto? No, there is a snake. The snake comes. The snake comes. He's a good boy. He can pass the ball. He likes to play. He's even going there. It's complicated. He's a woman, he's not like that. Does he know? He knows, he likes to say... He always supports his breasts, he loves to do it. He's not ashamed, you see? He's beautiful. He liked you! He just wants to be affectionate, Luciana. Not in fashion, right? So good, go. Julia goes, oh, he's there too! This is the proof! Hi Luciana, hi, super pop, how are you? My name is Giselle Kenji. I'm going to show you a little bit of what I know how to do. You don't have to show everything, but I'm going to show you a little bit. It's not easy, come on. You need to have a lot of technique, but sensuality is a very strong point in this dance. Some tips for people on stage not to do ugly. First tip, movement of the hip. Put your foot on the floor and pull the leg from the floor. Stay with the ball, support it. I'm going to flex my knee. When my knee flexes, with this leg also flexed, my hips fit here. Begin! The knees move and your hips too. One more tip, I'm going to keep my leg here and I'm going to keep both flexed. This one I'm going to keep, this one I'm going to stretch. Look at this. The foot does not leave the place. I'm just working my hips. Now I'm going to do some very sexy movements and a wave. I'm going to show you my two knees. Look, I'm just showing you my two knees for you. Look, I raise this leg and relax. I raise the other and relax. This continuous movement makes me have a lateral movement of my hips. Then the skirt hides the legs, which is the big thing. The secret of dancing where you are without solidity is not to show. And look at this. I can do this with my leg also attached. Same technique. Up and relax. Up and relax. Up and relax. Up and relax. Up and relax. Here try to stay fixed. Work just below. And the hand following. Then the hand comes and slips through the body. If you want to improve the situation, I'll give you one more. What you do here, you do here. Work only here. And if you can, work only the abdomen. And the hand. If you mix, the big body is in sensuality. Sensuality is not in you to show. It's in you to hide, to play. Give and take. Give and take. It's a joke. Life is a game. That's it. for the winner, let's go! This test is worth 200 points. What else do you want to do with the snake? It was his exit, man."

This week, I would like to do a ponden area analysis. First of all, this is a weekly chart, but this is a 3-part chart. As I introduced before, this channel extends to the lower part of the previous week. This is the upper part of the channel's wiring. This means that the possibility of reaching 137.78 was high. The last week was a little bit of a breakdown, and the channel was returned to normal. The channel is growing at the bottom. There is also a development that I swung while reaching 129.50, so I think that it will be necessary to look at it in the daily intraday chart.

Yes. Ken King with Lakes President announced yesterday that he's still not denied that the Sunners are going to keep his job there, but he's also putting forward that it's possibly a new assistant general manager to have him out. Do you think that helped Daryl? No. No, because no. All right, I think I helped that. Yes, I would trade him because I think that team needs to rebuild. I think they need to dump salary. No, you can't blame it on, but that doesn't mean that there's a space for him under the current system. They do not have a center to play for them. They do not have the cap space to get a center to play for them. You may as well move him and clear up some caps. All right. The MxRom is obviously no slumping team this year. No need to keep a look at the staff for that bad. But yesterday announced on TSN that they Who do you think they'll be getting? Taylor or Tyler? The scouting draft said they were number one and two. I honestly don't know. I haven't heard much of either of Bill and my sisters James' stuff to talk about yesterday. I would pick Taylor Hall because he played so well with Jordan Everly. And they both got one of so Mark. They're going to go flying once they get all their guys. A couple days ago, Sheldon Stewart requested a trade. Do you think that's because of the swapping team? He wants to get their team or is there stuff with him, Pac-Win? Could be any of those things I think with him. I think there's some personal stuff too. Alright. And the future Pac-Win? It's gone. It stays. I think he stays because I still think that they've got a young team that's building. I think he's a good coach for a young team. Yeah. And I think he will turn around. They've got to get their goal finished right now. And I don't think Quinn's problem. Alright. Steve Tambolini, general manager. Chris, gone. It stays. changes that they had a bad season like worse than usual though? Yeah. Alright so New York Rangers keeping John to Garelli, they signed them and they're number six draft picks. What happened with their ranges here? Oh they weren't the worst. They did lose to Phil Duff, get a Sunday game. So they're eight team plays by two points. What do you think? Probably we brought Target to rally in a little too late. It's part of it. Priorities they got a lot of overpriced guys who all want to be starting I put on Glencader. He's just not brought in the right players for what they need. They started turning around. They just didn't turn around quick enough. And a lot of it was rooted in injuries. Now that team should be fine. They do have to figure out what they're going to do about some of their older guys. They didn't move. They probably should have. They probably should buy it at Rod Reddendorm. Brian Burke is the team. They look like they have a core team coming up. Brian Burke is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most underrated, top quality, number one GMs in this league. He knows what he's doing. If he's allowed to do what he wants to do, and if he doesn't get any interference from MLSE because it's always been the top of Toronto, he's going to turn his team around. Yes, I believe with adding young players, GMs, Sebastian Deguere, and a few other stars in that team, this team can start rolling. The big issue is Gustavson's health. I think Brian Burke is a good GN and I think the Phenomenal Trade was good and they're making him captain next year right here. I might lift them a bit. All right, so the question is right. And it might be good for Fanon. Yes. Having that responsibility. That might help in the maturing process. My only concern for the Leaps is what I said in terms of her having the authority and the freedom to do what he needs to do. And whether long term Ron Wilson is the right coach for this thing. Yeah, the answer I was going to mention is Ron Wilson has been out of this slumber for quite a while. I hope that in the next, if things start to get better, I'm not sure he's the guy. What do you think? They're not that bad. Outloads and then you can do some management. Yeah, especially when you're getting Stephen Stamco's, because he's one of the goals.

Een goede verkoper weet op welke manier de artikelen in het assortiment het beste aan de man kunnen worden gebracht. Als verkoopspecialist echter weet je niet alleen heel goed hoe je klanten adviseert, je geeft ook leiding aan andere verkoopmedewerkers. Je geeft bijvoorbeeld aan wat er allemaal in de winkel moet gebeuren en op welke manier. van hun wordt verwacht. Zelf steek je natuurlijk ook de handen uit de mouwen om de winkel er zo aantrekkelijk mogelijk uit te laten zien. Ook plaats je bestellingen voor je klant, bijvoorbeeld omdat het gevraagde artikel niet in voorraad was. Je registreert de gegevens en meldt de klant wanneer het artikel bezorgd wordt of opgehaald kan worden. Als verkoopspecialist observeren je om de andere medewerkers te kunnen vertellen hoe ze de klant het beste kunnen benaderen. Je geeft tips, bijvoorbeeld over bijverkoop. Alleen probeer je ook een beetje bij te kopen. Dus als je een pak een riempje, pak een topje, een overrempje, pak een riempje van het luis voor op die broek. Dus probeer je daar een beetje meer op te letten. Zelf help je natuurlijk ook klanten. Als verkoopspecialist weet je als geen ander hoe je dit moet aanpakken. Je beantwoord vragen, informeer de klant over het artikel waarin hij of zij geïnteresseerd is en helpt om een keuze te maken door in te spelen op de zogeheten koopsignale. Doordraak, Jassier, want je vindt lekker snel aanschrijven. Even twilk, dan kan je nog een beetje het accent op de tijdje zetten. Door middel van die zoutjes hier binnen. Leuk zoutje erbij, even twilk of zo. Ook zoutje, ja. Waarom? Dit wel een hele mooie. Bijverkoop is belangrijk, maar niet ten koste van alles. Je klant moet immers tevreden de winkel verlaten. Je controleert en registreert wat er nog is of je laat het hun collega doen. Moet de voorraad worden aangevuld, dan bestel je de benodigde artikelen of je doet voorstellen om het assortiment op het juiste peil te houden. Denk jij dat je verkooptalent bezit?

As a sales specialist, you don't only know how to advise your clients, you also teach other salespeople. You give them what they need to do in the store and how they do it. You can also take the hands off the furniture to show the shop as attractive as possible. You also place orders for your client, for example because the requested article was not in advance. You register the data and report the client when the article is delivered or can be picked up. As a sales specialist you observe to be able to tell the other employees how they can best approach the client. You give tips, for example about sale. Try to sell a little. Take a belt, a top, a top, a belt, take the ear for the belly. Try to sell a little more. You help customers as well. As a sales specialist, you know how to handle this. You answer questions, inform the customer about the article he or she is interested in... ...and help to make a choice by playing on the so-called shopping signals. Can you put the accent on the time? With the salt in the middle? With salt or something? With salt, yes. But it's a bit too much. This is a nice one. You check and register what's left, or you let your colleague do it. If you have to fill out the form, you order the required articles.

Therefore the trust should be, as far as my experience goes, the trust should be to ensure change in behavior change in behaviors by building a strong trustworthy bond, the trustworthy relationship which in turn will motivate the client, motivation to the extent to become self-confident and own the responsibility of preventing HIV infection at both individual, society or the community level. As far as the gene state goes, we have three different regions. the Jammu region, the Kashmir region, the Ladakh, all the three regions are entirely different from each other. Geographically, linguistically, culturally, and tradition wise as well, even religious differ. So, I mean that we have different backgrounds, people are from different backgrounds, and they have different values which influence their attitudes towards HIV-AIDS. So, counselors also have their own values and share their cultural prejudices. must not allow them to influence their counseling. That's an important factor. Secondly, culture and tradition influence the way in which people respond to HIV infection and AIDS, and counselors must respect those of others. They must therefore explore the prevailing belief about illness and in particular, in particular, the HIV infection and their effort to motivate behavioral change must take these belief systems into their grasp. They must help clients and their families to discover culturally acceptable ways of expressing emotions. Emotions like anger, sadness, guilt, fear. You see, because HIV infection is transmitted sexually, so cultural attitudes towards sex and sexuality are extremely important in prevention. So it may be difficult to change the culturally sanctioned behavior and therefore the knowledge, attitudes and skills of the councillor should be versatile, versatile enough to find other forms of the protection. And I expect that bi-councillors must have contingency plan in place, in place to handle this situation in a best possible way. Now, the councillor must achieve a balance, it should be a balance between warmth and acceptance, on one hand, and objectively on the other. So, there were certain essential qualities. like caring, empathy, tell-save awareness should exist or be developed in a council. That's an important factor. The council should also be capable of employing some specific counseling skills or techniques that may increase the effectiveness, effectiveness of the process, of the counseling process. I mean, like some of the techniques maybe like active attending, of bailing, interpretation, concentration and summarization.

And if not, why not? Well last week I had the fabulous Chris Williams on from Ancestry.com, also quite the renowned ghost hunter, to talk about the parentage of Joffrey Baratheon, and could Ned Stark have proven his lineage otherwise? Was Ned Stark just sticking his neck out for nothing? what I wanted to know. And you guys had lots of comments. See, Nelson said, they all had black hair, to which Chris actually wrote back and replied on YouTube. She said, they all could have black hair, but it depends on both parents and the genes or traits they carry. My aunt and uncle both had dark brown hair like me, but they have two blonde children. That means they both carried the recessive gene for blonde hair, which then showed in their children. So there is still the possibility that Robert is Joffrey's dad. It sounds weird, but it is possible. So strike another one down for Ned. journey for knowledge, which ended poorly. But no spoilers, right guys? Right? No spoilers. This week we have the fantastic Ben Heck on the show, and we're going to be talking about a topic that I have wanted to discuss for a really long time, ever since the most recent movie came out in fact. But we were just waiting for the right person, and Ben is that guy. Of course we were talking about the Iron Man suit. Could it be real or not? So Ben, thank you so much for joining us. I can't believe we haven't been on a show together before. I mean, we've been on the same network forever. I know, it's just you can probability that is very high. Very strange. But that's life. Well, I've been meaning to do an episode on the Iron Man suit forever. And obviously, you are one of the perfect people to talk to, especially with your experience with modding. So I'm curious to know your opinion on how the suit has kind of changed over the years. So kind of how it's changed. You know, in the first movie, you know, he's got all those robot arms in his garage, which is amazing. And it puts a suit on for him. You know, it kind of looks like a car factory. Even though both cars are mostly built by hand, kind of in this conception of the about the Golden, but you know it's like a car factory puts it all on and then so it's like you know he has to do it you know he has to kind of like stand there and hold it to the best and then you know the first movie is so great he goes over fights the terrorists or whatever and he comes back and the suit won't come off because it's been you know shot up and I'm like yes that's exactly what would happen it would not come off because it's all bent and stuff that was very very realistic but then yes as the movies proceed they have to make it more complicated and more filming so to speak and so the So it was almost like it was realistic in the beginning and then do you think it was because of audience expectations of wanting to see something even more spectacular as the movies progressed that made it more more fantastical? both of them. For me, the Ironman suits kind of seem like a combination between something like a military exoskeleton that's providing an extra layer of shielding and also something like a battle mech that we would see from like video games where they really are much larger vehicles almost but those make a little more sense in terms of the power supply because those would have some kind of way to power themselves versus a smaller suit like device that really doesn't have a lot of storage for that kind of thing. like this again first movie that wasn't a problem buddy it's so cool like in part three and he walks out of the bar and his suit standing there like a motorcycle and he gets into it you know and it closes that's really cool but I mean you basically tripling the weight just with all the things that close and open it but again it looks cool on screen as far as how that compares to like the extra suits we're talking about yeah you know if you have something larger you'd have more room for the motors you'd have more room for batteries and you know the batteries to power it those have a lot of weight so not only you have to get past the weight of the batteries you're using to power it before you can get into the strength stuff. So in your opinion, how far away would we theoretically be from creating a suit like the one that Tony Stark has, if at all? Assuming we had a magical power source like he has. Yes. I don't know. The Tony Stark kind of suit. I don't know. You could do it now, but it wouldn't be realistic. Gotcha. I mean, it's interesting to see like the Exel Skeleton stuff and not just for DARPA stuff, but rehabilitation like if someone can't walk. Now, I know we don't have any Iron Man movies for sure on the horizon. I know there have been some whisperings about perhaps going back to it or at least in a future Avengers movie, but what do you think they could possibly add to the suit going forward in the fictional world? See, I never understood the glove. If you were actually making a suit like that, you wouldn't have your fingers exposed because that would be far and away the most, you know. I don't care what he made. If you got hit with like a 50-caliber mortar, his hand would be gone. You know, you put the hand inside of something and it would actually get another hand up here. Yeah. That's what I would do if I was voting an Iron Man suit. I like my hands attached. I really like the idea of a self-repairing Iron Man suit. I think that is really the next logical step because so much of the last movie was taken up with repairing the damn thing. It seems like he would build that into the next iteration. Yeah, like maybe he'd get like a little 3-printer in the bag and if they did it realistically. So it's sort of like magical, you know, liquid metal terminator kind of stuff. Like nanobots. Yeah, see that's like, don't be asked. But anyway, Ben, thank you so much. So I'm gonna say that this is probably in the realm of fictional. Right now, yes. Right now, yes. Okay, and then if we did do it, it'd probably be more along the lines of either an exoskeleton type thing, but losing some of the flight and and battle properties that the Iron Man suit has, or we would go even larger wherein we would have the ability to have that power source and actually use it for some kind of combat. Right, and actually if it was used for combat it would even more likely be an autonomous remotely controlled suit because the Space Rabbit Downing Jr. takes up. You can fit so many electronics in that space. It'd be better to have a base. It's like when they talk about space travel, you know it's a lot cheaper to send like a bunch of probes and margs into space. Ben, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. So Iron Man Tony Stark suit style, fictional. But for military uses, exoskeletons for example, and patient rehabilitation, yeah, we're gonna give that one a fact at least in the near future, which is very, very cool. But speaking of movies and speaking of superheroes, have you guys seen the new Superman movie? I'm seeing it tonight, actually. Not tonight when the show is coming out, but tonight when we are shooting the show. And I'm still excited about it, even though the reviews have been kinda meh. Do you guys have any Superman questions or is that just way too fictional? But anyway, let me know what else you want to see right here on the show. That's it for this week. If you want to check out more episodes of Fact or Fictional, make sure you head back to youtube.com.seachecfeed every Friday. Until next time, I'm Veronica.

Today I'm going to show you how to get some really good render settings for Sony Vegas. So first, what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to click properties, disable, re-sample, and unclick maintain aspect ratio. Then you're going to want to go to event pan crop, which is right over there at the end of the clip, or you can right click and you'll see it. Now what you're going to want to do is you're going to go to a place where you can clearly see the black lines and then you're going to try to make the width. You're going to go to project properties and you're going to go to width and you're going to make that 1280 and height 720. The frame rate you're going to make 30 FPS. The field order is none, progressive scan. Pixel aspect ratio is 1.0 square. The output ratio is 0 degrees original. Stereoscopic 3D is off. Pixel format is 32 bit floating point full range. Compositing gamma is 1.0 linear. Full resolution rendering quality is at best. Motion blur type is at Gossin. And DMTRLYS method, if you have an HD PVR using component cables or like a Blackmagic intensity pro, it's going to be none. But if you have like a dazzle, easy cap, or an HD PBR standard definition which you're recording with. You're gonna want to use the blend pull pulls, you know, to erase method. Now what you wanna do next is click render. It's the render settings. You're gonna wanna go to main concept, you're gonna go to main concept A-V-C slash A-A-C custom. You're gonna, you wanna do width, 1280, Do not allow source to adjust frame size. Profiles main, frame rate is 59.94 fps. Field order is non-progressive. Pixel aspect ratio is 1.0. Number of reference frames is 2.0. Use the blocking filter. Variable bit rate is 14 million. and then you want to click save and then it'll start to render. I also have another way to do it with the WMV so that'll come up anytime in the video but I'm not gonna you can just pause the video and get the settings. So this has been a tutorial by Captain C and going to be making more of these for like color correction effects and all that stuff later on so I'll see you guys later.","Hello YouTube!

Τι να κάνω αυτό δεν αλλάζει. Σαρανταρίσουμε κοτέβουμε. Τώρα στα γερά μου το δεν μπορώ να ανταλάξουμε. Σεγά μου, αριθαγ και να μην ήταν ο Γιώργος, πάλι θα ήθελε σαν σε διάφερνα να κάνεις γυρωφίζιον. Ναι, αμέ. Μια χαρά. Επειδή φέτος ανακατευτείκαμε και εμείς βάλαμε το χεράκι μας, δεν ξέρω το χρόνο πρώτα τόσο να είμαστε καλά. Για να έχουμε λίγο το μαράκι στα υποψημπάρα καλά πολύ, μια πετακατορίτσα, να την μαρκάριμο, ωραία όντατα. Θέλω τώρα να σκεφτείς και να μου πεις, τη μεγάλωτηρη υπερβολή που έχεις ακούσει για το άτομο σου, είτε να την ακούσε κάποια εκπομπή τη λόπτυκη ραδιοφων Τις πραγματικούς, πάντα για τα δικά σου ξέρεις, στάντα, αυτή. να κάνει με το παιδί γιατί δεν έχω κάνει ακόμα παιδί αν θα έκανε ξοματική αν θα υιοθετούσε ένα παιδί αυτό. Και δεν μπορεί να καθαρά προσωπικό σου και δεν θα έρευγω στο ζητάνο. Και επίσης κάτι που έχει σχέση με αυτό ότι πριν κάποιον καιρό επειδή εγώ είχα πει στην εκκομπή μου νομίζω ότι έχω πόνο στο στομάχη μου είχα μία γαστρεντερήτη δαϊαλήθεια είναι είχανε βγάλει ότι είμαι έγιος και εγώ θέλω πάρα πολύ να μείνω αλλά περιμέντε πρώτα να το νιώσω εγώ. Και να σας το πω εγώ. Και μετά να σας το πω.","If I don't make the mistake in one of the last live shows, you're also making mistakes. I'm glad you're saying that because they said a lot. At first it was a great song. Nevertheless, I have a specific relationship with this song. Since when I heard it I was like, I'll have to keep it secret and I'm ashamed of it. You're saying that because you said it in the morning, I think that the mega... I don't know what you said. You said that... I agree that I am a happy person. For me, yes, I am happy and I am honest. I have been a partner for all these years. I have earned it from my truth. At that moment, the particular song reminds me a lot of things. I have been a part of a particular event that always with the ball. The truth is that I had talked to Thanasi before. I said it. And when I was on the stage, I saw him so excited. And I was even more excited. I tried to hold it before I got up. I couldn't. I said, now what will I do? I will stay here and I won't get up. And I said, why? I will cry. I will go and see what happens. That happened. And of course, a great show. And it was a moment, a second minute where this happens. and he was very human, I say it with the hand in the heart. He was something very personal to me, which he had in his heart and I had it. After I turned around and looked at him, he knew me. He was also Antonis. All his life. Good and we are the ones who have to be a little bit more calm. He is a good person. He has a lot of friends, he does nothing for me. He is not such a person, you know him. He is a friend, he is a friend. Imagine you would come to the toilet every Sunday. Every Sunday? So the Sunday is the time because it is something related to the two of you. It is something that is a song that makes me feel terrible. And I can tell you something else. I am a little more emotional as a person. I am very sensitive. What can I do? This does not change. We are getting closer to 40. Now we cannot change our age. and if George was not there, he would have come again. Because we were walking and we put our hand on it. I don't know if the time is right. Let's have a little bit of a maraca. Let's have a maraca in the box. Very nice, a little bit of a cat-a-roa. Let's mark it nicely. I want you to tell me the greatest surprise you have heard about your man, or to hear it from someone, a radio speaker, or to see it written on a notebook. Something you heard said, or even written and you say, I see. Always for your own sake, you know the standard. Yes. It's a bit of a hassle. Yes, something that you say and you say, I see, what is this? Where do you go? I usually don't go to the office, but what you sometimes tell me, I was not able to do it with the child because I have not yet made a child. If I would do it externally, if I would adopt a child, that's it. And you can say that it is clear to your personality that you will not like to talk to you. And also something that has a connection with that, that before some time, because I had told my brother that I have pain in my stomach, I had a little bit of a headache, the truth is, they had removed that I was sick. And I really want to stay. But wait first. I feel it. And I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you."

I know I said in one of my other videos I was gonna talk about the shadow duos. These... shit. These are only $10 now at Sephora. They were originally 20. I don't know yet if they're completely getting rid of her duos or if they're coming out with all new colors, but I ended up getting all of them. No, I didn't get them all at the same time. I slowly got all of them. I can fully make the video and show swatches and stuff and I also got her High Voltage I primer so I wanted to talk about that I've used this a couple times and First of all the packaging is amazing. It's got like nautical stars and lightning bolts This stuff is so awesome first of all it's got better packaging than Urban Decay primer potion. It's Just to describe it, I want to show you, you only need a tiny bit because this is pigmented, it's not clear. Well, primer potion is not clear, but you know how it blends in. This is more like a concealer consistency. So I mean, you only need a little tiny bit and you blend that all out on the lid. It does an awesome job of correcting your eyelid color. Like if you have yellowish lids, it just completely gets rid of that. So it is kind of like a peachy skin tone color. But this picks up eyeshadow like nobody's business. It's like the website says attract shadow like a magnet. That's exactly what it does. Just to show you, I'll show you one of the cat bondy shadows. This is actually the blue one. It's called Moonshine. And I'll just take This is on my hand without primer. Hold on. So that is that without the primer. You can see the primer is right next to it. It's darker than my skin. And then when I put it over the primer, it's like insanity. See how much better? It's just an awesome awesome primer. And I know you guys are gonna ask, I have really oily lids. Like the only thing that has ever worked for me is Urban Decay primer potion, which is why I was kind of iffy on trying a new primer. I wore it all day and it only started creasing like maybe 10 hours in. So that's the only downside. Like Urban Decay Primer Potion I can go all day without my shadow creasing. But this one, like 10 hours it starts creasing. Creasing which isn't a big deal because you can always touch it up. But I do love how it makes shadows look when you use it. So that's my take on the primer, eye primer. And it is cheaper than Urban K's by a couple of bucks. This one's 15, and I think the Urban Decay one is 18. Anyway, to the shadows. The duos come with two shades that are pretty... Plus, the duos come with two shades that are pretty much identical. Only one side is just the shimmer side, and the other side has glitter in it, silver glitter in it. although I think some of them are just matte on one side and glittery. So anyway, this one is moonshine. This is the shimmery and this is the glittery. It's not gonna focus. And I need something to wipe this on. Save the dark ones for last. This one is called a believer. It is, whoa, this side is a white with silvery glitter in it and then just a shimmery white. This is the shimmery white and the glittery one. So you can see they're pretty much identical. They weren't meant to be like a lid and a crease color. They're just two different shades, one with glitter, one without. This one is called Confessional. I think this is pretty much one of my favorites. It's like a really pretty champagne color. Of course this side with the glitter and then this side is just shimmer. You can see that the glittery side It's pretty much a dupe for urban decays midnight cowboy only without as much obnoxious glitter because that is a really friggin glittery eyeshadow My eye won't stop watering Next This is King Cobra Really pretty greens. This is the glittery one The glitter isn't like so overpowering, but it does show up. It's really pretty and then that's the shimmery one, which the shimmery one in this one one is a little darker. What else? Uh, groupie is purple. So you have the glittery, glittery side, and then this shimmery purplish kinda with blue undertones in it. This one's not that pigmented, but it's still really pretty. Um, Livewire is another really pretty color. Um, it's kinda like a dark, tannish brown. the glittery side and then the shimmery one. Again the shimmery one is darker than the glittery one. This one is six shooter. It's silver. So you have the silver glittery one. Really pretty and pigmented and then just the shimmery silver. Gorgeous color. Then we have motor head which is black. You have glittery black and you have just a matte black. Very pigmented. This is, I'm not sure if in her, um, what do you call it? In her palette if this is Lucifer, but it looks pretty damn close. If it's just her matte black is named something different in this, I don't know. And then the last one is riffraff, which is brown. So you have glittery brown, and you have matte brown. So that's all of them. There's nine all together. Like I said on Sephora.com and I don't know if it's in the Sephora stores The last time I went to Sephora they didn't have these out anywhere, so I don't know if the stores already got rid of them on the website. They're only $10 now. They were originally 20 so they're really good shadows if you want to pick up a few highly recommend it and Also recommend the eye primer to it's really really good Like I said, this is with her primer and this is without. So it really just picks up the color so well. So that's it for now and I'll talk to you guys later. And one more thing, if you go to my blog I'm going to have better pictures of swatches of all the colors. So if you want to go click all over there I will put the link in the under bar or whatever you want to call it now. So I'll have the link to my blog and all the pictures that I took of the swatches of the colors.","Hey guys, this is a Kat Von D haul.

First of all it's got better packaging than Urban Decay primer potion. It's Just to describe it, I want to show you, you only need a tiny bit because this is pigmented, it's not clear. Well, primer potion is not clear but you know how it blends in. This is more like a concealer consistency. So I mean, you only need a little tiny bit and you blend that all out on the lid. It does an awesome job of correcting your eyelid color. Like if you have yellowish lids, it just completely gets rid of that. So it is kind of like a peachy skin tone color. But this picks up eyeshadow like nobody's business. It's like the website says attract shadow like a magnet. That's exactly what it does. Just to show you, I'll show you one of the cat bondy shadows. This is actually the blue one. It's called Moonshine. And I'll just take This is on my hand without primer. Hold on. So that is that without the primer. You can see the primer is right next to it. It's darker than my skin. And then when I put it over the primer, it's like insanity. See how much better? It's just an awesome awesome primer. And I know you guys are gonna ask, I have really oily lids. Like the only thing that has ever worked for me is Urban Decay primer potion, which is why I was kind of iffy on trying a new primer. I wore it all day and it only started creasing like maybe 10 hours in. So that's the only downside. Like Urban Decay Primer Potion I can go all day without my shadow creasing but this one like 10 hours it starts creasing. Creasing which isn't a big deal because you can always touch it up but I do love how it makes shadows look when you use it. So that's my take on the primer, eye primer. And it is cheaper than Urban K's by a couple of bucks. This one's 15, and I think the Urban Decay one is 18. Anyway, to the shadows. The duos come with two shades that are pretty... Plus, the duos come with two shades that are pretty much identical. Only one side is just the shimmer side, and the other side has glitter in it, silver glitter in it. although I think some of them are just matte on one side and glittery. So anyway, this one is moonshine. This is the shimmery and this is the glittery. It's not gonna focus. And I need something to wipe this on. Save the dark ones for last. This one is called a believer. It is, whoa, this side is a white with silver glitter in it and then just a shimmery white. This is the shimmery white and the glittery one. So you can see they're pretty much identical. They weren't meant to be like a lid and a crease color. They're just two different shades, one with glitter, one without. This one is called Confessional. I think this is pretty much one of my favorites. It's like a really pretty champagne color. Of course this side with the glitter and then this side is just shimmer. You can see that the glittery side It's pretty much a dupe for urban decays midnight cowboy only without as much obnoxious glitter because that is a really friggin glittery eyeshadow My eye won't stop watering Next This is king cobra Really pretty greens. This is the glittery one The glitter isn't like so overpowering, but it does show up. It's really pretty and then that's the shimmery one, which the shimmery one in this one This one is a little darker. What else? Uh, groupie is purple. So you have the glittery, glittery side and then this shimmery purplish kinda with blue undertones in it. This one's not that pigmented but it's still really pretty. Um, Livewire. It's another really pretty color. Um, it's kinda like a dark, tannish brown. the glittery side and then the shimmery one. Again the shimmery one is darker than the glittery one. This one is six shooter. It's silver so you have the silver glittery one. Really pretty and pigmented and then just the shimmery silver. Gorgeous color. Then we have motor head which is black. You have glittery black and you have just a matte black. Very pigmented. This is... I'm not sure if in her... um... what do you call it? In her palette if this is Lucifer, but it looks pretty damn close. If it's just her matte black is named something different in this, I don't know. And then the last one is Riff Raff, which is brown. So you have glittery brown, and you have matte brown. So that's all of them. There's nine all together. Like I said on Sephora.com and I don't know if it's in the Sephora stores The last time I went to Sephora they didn't have these out anywhere, so I don't know if the stores already got rid of them on the website. They're only $10 now. They were originally 20 so they're really good shadows if you want to pick up a few highly recommend it and Also recommend the I-primer too. It's really really good Like I said, this is with her primer and this is without. So it really just, it picks up the color so well. So that's it for now and I'll talk to you guys later. And one more thing, if you go to my blog I'm going to have better pictures of swatches of all the colors. So if you want to go click over there I will put the link in the under bar or whatever you want to call it now. So I'll have the link to my blog and all the pictures that I took of the swatches of the colors."

No, no. porque es tanto, no es como que sí porque la disquera que está exigiendo ahorita hacer un disco y agarrar las canciones o hacen canciones, es decir, sin sentido o eso es por rellenar realmente las canciones que yo estoy incluyendo en el disco como de pasados en canciones que de verdad las he sentido las he vivido creo que esa es como la diferencia y que a la gente de repente me dice que mi música no es una plástica que se identifican y te siga haciendo más canciones así entonces yo creo que el ser un hombre es todo estar al ser del pedero, el trabajo, ahí está. O sea que tú sientes que definitivamente el ser un artista independiente como eres tú ha llevado una lógica como tú quieres hacer su tu carrera porque no te sentirían de la misma manera si estuvieras en una disquera que te exige hacer 10 temas para cada disco, dos discos al año o algo así. Más que todo no es el que exigiasen que te dicen esas canciones no aunque sea lo más puro ¿Cuáles son los grandes de Sherry que presentaciones al tener? y si te vamos a poder recantar en Guatemala ¿Qué es el movimiento musical en Guatemala? hasta recuerdo algunos reportajes que le dirían el periodo de la artículo de la de Básico que las mujeres no se atraven y que porque si es de noche que pobrecita la niña es de noche no puedes salir a cantar o sea que como que es mucho más difícil la carrera para una mujer que para un hombre pero te juro yo empecé a cantar y de repente surgieron así y un montón de gente de patojas que yo no conocía y que de repente así como que no como que como que sí se le dio de cierta forma como que Se dieron cuenta que sí se podía hacer, que no pasaba nada, no nos come lobo. Y con las bandas, igual hay muchísimo talento aquí en Guatemala. Yo cada vez que escucho un músico nuevo, a lo sí digo, hay algo, ¿verdad? Y muchos que ni siquiera han estudiado música ni nada, no es nato. Yo creo que es un buen momento desde hace unos años para atrás, de atrás para adelante, mejor dicho, en donde el mercado comenteco está como más expuesto. y Sí, por internet, por internet. Como decirlo por internet. Luego, cuando regalé el disco de Santa, como que hay un montón de disparos. Como se le furran, se le acaba de sacar y ya lo quiere regalar. Pero hay que usar las herramientas que uno tiene y a partir de que regale el disco, te ayudan a dar cuenta que no, el mundo está regalando todo ahora porque tenemos que tener lo que tenemos en nuestras manos. y para mí eso también ha sido una experiencia increíble porque me sigue escuchando gente de muchísimos lados del planeta que uno de otra forma no podía llegar a ellos el hi-five todavía hasta el momento ya es demasiado la gente que se une a hacer mis fans que yo siempre lo sigo llevando mis amigos que siempre me levantan en ánimo y me escriben de todas partes ayer estaba preguntando que si era que hablaba y me dieron que me escribían así y así como que el día no se escorraba entonces te vas a agudar que a por miente decidí a ver qué lo están diciendo y así como que me encanta así como que me gusta tu voz no sé qué esto es mi correo cuando quieras venir aquí aquí estamos entonces satisfactor lo más importante para ti entonces es más que la gente conozca tu música que la escuché a lucrar digamos con lo que fue el disco por ejemplo con la estrategia que hiciste de regalar tu disco a poco tiempo le interesaba más que la gente conociera tu música tu sentimiento y propagar tu música por todas las horas. Siempre ha sido de verdad de que empecé y yo puedo ver todavía las entrevistas de que de verdad o sea no es de que haya cambiado de partido y nada siempre ha sido un momento de que la gente conozca mi música. Mi mayor mercado de la gente que compran mi música es extranjera el disco lo tenemos en Zidane, lo tenemos en iTunes, en Amazon entonces compran una canción, compran el disco completo y entonces creo que todo eso sí me ayudó cuando sientes de que bueno ya tenemos lo del disco y ahora es así como que por qué no regalar la escarra completa del disco, todo y fotos, todo hasta con bonus ¿verdad? y eso subió las ventas porque entonces al escuchar el disco completo Lo querían tener. ¿Qué puede encontrar a la gente al ingresar a Sherry.net? Siempre está súper actualizada la página, siempre hay nuevas fotos, me gusta subir algunas cancioncitas que esto va a empezar a hacer, así, inéditas. Ay, qué bonito. Para que vayan conociendo que estas trabajan. Que usted, que sea algo como interactuar, muchos han agento, porque cuando escogimos el segundo sencillo del disco, la gente fue la que... La que escogió. Puse tres, las tres favoritas, digamos, ¿Cuál es el mensaje final que le quieras dejar a la gente o a semana? de ahí dependemos de todo estar siempre son clientes porque si uno está así es con la cara así toda triste, seguro que tu día así se va a volver hasta la hora de volver. Y se contagia de repente, tal vez uno hace todo feliz y de repente se va a ir y manda así todo triste y no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, a corto y a largo plazo para que las puedan cumplir y no se sientan animes.

No. Right now we are in that process, because at the end of the year I will be able to receive the name and things like that, the finished records for the next year. It's time for me to go to the RAPS MISCO. That's six months, my God, but I'm lucky that I told you that. I don't want to say that because it's so much, it's not like it's true because the record is demanding to make a record and to take the songs, they make songs that are incented, that can be re-enact, really the songs that I am including in the record as from past songs that are really incented, I have lived them, I think that's like the difference, and that people suddenly tell me that my music is not plastic, that it is identified, and you keep doing more songs like that, so I think that being a man is to be a father to your work. So you feel that being an independent artist like you have been a logic as you want to be in your career, because you wouldn't feel the same way if you were in a label that demands you do 10 songs for each album, 2 albums per year or something like that. I think that if you do 10 songs for this album, suddenly it is very good that they change the style, that suddenly you are told that these songs are not even the purest that you have in your heart. You are not, do me these. So for the moment, thank God, I have been very privileged because there is no one who tells me, look, that is not, that is like that and I have been able to leave For this second material you were telling us that you wanted to invite artists to sing with you. You have someone confirmed or you just have the idea of inviting someone? Well, that's a surprise. I had already confirmed that there was 100% and almost the song is there, but it was not yet. It's not the end yet, it's not going to be a surprise. What are the plans for the show? What are the performances? What are the plans for the show? What are the plans for the show?

What are the There are news from New Mexico. There are many bands that have been released recently. There are not as many soloists as you. You have your niche as well. I think they have been released. Yes, but let's say that bands that are released are more soloists. How is the musical movement in Guatemala? In the last year, for example? It has grown. It has grown a lot. When I started, for example, I don't remember that there were women, I am an immigrant, singing for nothing. I remember some reports that I read in the newspaper. The article says that women don't get married. And that if it's night time, poor girl, it's night time, you can't go out to sing. It's more difficult to live for a woman than for a man. But I swear, I started singing and suddenly a lot of people came up, people I didn't know, and suddenly they said no. They realized that it could be done, that nothing happened, they didn't eat us crazy. And with the bands, there's a lot of talent here in Guatemala. Every time I listen to new music, I say, oh, great, right? And many who haven't even studied music, or anything, it's not natural. I think it's a good moment, a few years ago, from back to forward, as I said, where the market, I think, is more expensive. I always keep exploring my voice, but I can still give a lot more. I keep writing about how much I think about it and I feel it. So I think that one as an artist never ends up with it. I think that it has already opened up my mind because when I... I know that it wasn't that long ago, we are three years. Yes, for the internet, at least. Like, how do you say it? For the internet, right? Then when I gave the album to Santa, like, a lot of people stopped. How do you give it to Santa? How do you push him? He just took it out and he wants to give it to him. But... There are two healthy tools that one has and from the fact that I gave the album, I realized that no one is giving it everything now because we have to have something that we have in our hands. And for me that has been an incredible experience because I keep listening to people from many places on the planet that one, in another way, could not reach them. The high five still so far is too many people that join to make my fans, I always keep calling them my friends, they always raise me in spirit and they write me everywhere, there he is asking if it was I was like, I don't know where to say it, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I I think that I listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen to I bought my music is foreign. The album we have in Seath Baby, we have it in iTunes, Amazon, so I bought a song, I bought the full album and then I think that all of that did help me when they feel that well, we already have the album and they already feel like why not give me the full album and photos, everything, even with bonus, right? And that was the sales, because then when I heard the full album I wanted to have it. What can people find when they enter Sherry.net? It's always great to look at the website, there are always new photos, I like to upload some songs that I'm going to start doing, I'm going to edit them. Oh, how nice! So that you can get to know these works. And you, that you interact with many people, because when we chose the simple second of the album, the people were the ones who chose it. I chose three favorites, let's say, Well, what is the final message you want to leave to people or to the week? I think that from there we all depend on being always in the right direction because if one is like that with the face and all sad, surely your day will be like that and it will be like that and it will be like that suddenly, sometimes it's not like that, happy or sad, someone else is like that and I don't know what to say. So I think it's important to always have good attitude, to believe in something, something that would help you to go forward, to get into goals. I'll make a short video and make a long video so that I can make you feel comfortable. And that you always have God in your heart."

Ha tenido mucho impacto el tema de la asignación universal. No sabemos cuánto. Que sea el 25%, subiera, ojalá, pero estaría indicando dos cosas. 25% fíjese, tendremos 10 millones y medio, llega a 11 millones y medio los alumnos y consideramos la educación especial y la educación de adultos son muchos, 20% no más son más de 2 millones de chicos, se necesita mucha escuela, miles de escuelas. Entonces debemos manejarnos con seriedad en las cifras que por ahí decimos, pero lo cierto es que hay muchos chicos en el sistema y que lo debemos incorporar y no hay una infraestructura, una infraestructura por ahí en cantidad si llegáramos a incorporar todos los que han quedado fuera del sistema. en la secundaria tenemos una decepción de más del 40%. Entonces por eso propusimos una experiencia que fue me lo sé que se aprobó en el Senado, el Servicio Cívico que era darle oportunidad de terminalidad educativa en octavo y noveno a chicos que estaban fuera el sistema, que estaban en la calle, que estaban limpiando vidrio. ¿Y qué lo que hicimos? Utilizamos todos los lugares que habían disponibles, las instalaciones del ejército, la fuerza aérea, si tienen escuelas de esto. Se tergibersó esa idea. Miren, mientras hayas un docente con ganas de enseñar, yo un alumno con ganas de aprender ya con escuela. No hay que fijarse en el lugar. No es la calle maestra de la vida. No es cierto eso. Los chicos tienen que estar en la escuela. Bueno, creo que te habla suficiente. Creo que interpretó bien y te agradezco Aldo tus palabras e interpretarme. Y bueno, mi agradecimiento para terminar. Mi familia que está aquí presente. a mis padres, esos padres que bueno, hoy no pueden entender, tengo un padre fallecido, no me arro muy enferma, pero tengo mi maestra de primer grabado, quien tuve la grata, no se pensaba en esa época poner un turno más, otro turno más, los llevaba a la escuela los domingos, el frío abril que sea, por aquellos que por ahí quedaban más atrasados, gracias, gracias Marta, en ello va el reconocimiento a todos, a todos los docentes que permitieron la formación y el sueño de nuestro padre y ese legado que se perdió, ese legado de nuestros padres como en el caso mío con estudios primarios lo único, lo único que pensaban en darle la mejor educación a sus hijos. A todos ustedes, por ahora, dicen que en la vida hay que tener un hijo y es y escribir un libro y darse por satisfecho. Como medicino he plantado muchos árboles porque para nosotros el árbol representa muchas cosas. Tengo tres hijos maravillosos y bueno, este es el libro, pero tengo muchas ganas más de seguir trabajando por este país. Y trabajar por la educación es trabajar por la Argentina. Muchas gracias. ¡Suscríbete!","The State has to follow closely the statistics. It has had a lot of impact on the issue of universal resignation. We don't know how much. If it were 25%, it would be, hopefully, but it would be indicating two things. 25%, we would have 10.5 billion, 11 million, and half of the students, if we consider special education and the education of the students. of adults are more than 20 percent, not more than 2 million children. There are many schools, thousands of schools. So we must handle the numbers we say, but the truth is that there are many children in the system and that we must incorporate it. There is no infrastructure, no infrastructure, in quantity if we incorporate all those who have stayed outside the system. In the secondary we have a decision of more than 40%. So that's why we proposed, an experience that was in the 12th, that was approved in the Senate, the Civic Service, which was to give the opportunity of educational terminality in octavo and noveno to guys who were outside the system, who were in the street, who were cleaning the glass. And what did we do? We used all the places that were available, the facilities, the army, the air force, if they have a school there, that idea was triggered. Look, while you are a teacher and want to teach, I am a student and want to learn already with a school. You don't have to be afraid of the city. You know, it's not the street, the teacher of life. It's not true. The kids have to be at school. Well, I think I've talked enough. I think I interpreted well and I thank you for your words and for interpreting me. And well, thank you for finishing. My family is here. My parents, those parents who, well, today they can understand me, I have a father who passed away, he was very sick, but I have my first master's degree, who had the degree, he didn't think about that time to put another class, another class, he took them to school on Sundays or whatever, for those who were later, thanks to Marta. In this way, we recognize all the teachers who allowed the formation and dream of our father. And that legacy that was lost, that legacy of our father, as in the case of Mio, with primary studies, the only thing they thought about was giving the best education to their children. to write a book and to be satisfied. As a medicine, I have planted many trees. For us, the tree represents many things. I have three wonderful children. And well, this is the book, but I really want to continue working for this country. And working for education is working for Argentina. Thank you very much."

From the beginning of June, another partners appeared, the center of the network, from the English language learning. They invest almost 500 free classes for children. For them it is not a class, but a normal game. Here, in the frames of the campaign, good things of children were received one more time, free to learn English language. They will go through the first course of the learning. 18 children's families were invited to the English language. The music of the dance and the singing will be remembered by the new words. I have a big tower. It's a bridge. It's walking along the field. The ends of the road are on the field, to the very bottom. You have to tell this tower in English? Yes. How long do you have to learn the language to tell such a tower? Two hours. The full course of the training will continue in the future. At this time, the children will be able to learn new words, grammar and speech. The middle-class family can afford it, but since the children are from a few safe families and not everyone can learn English, which is very necessary today, we decided to get involved in the social campaign and good deeds. We are very happy, we are very calm. So, paid courses and foreign language for many children's families are often not available for free. The courses are very expensive, they cost a lot. We understand the possibility of love. They studied hard, they liked it very much, they improved their knowledge. They feel better than before. From the beginning of the class, children can be from 6 to 8 years old. They plan to increase the number of students and the number of groups. We are very happy that new partners are supporting us, that we are getting a job. new enterprises, and also that they propose their ideas and together with us they implement them. And this is a very good thing, because children get the opportunity to learn the international language with interesting methods. For two years, the campaign Good Affairs, which is held by the city administration of the internal politics, has supported almost 200 enterprises. Irana Shubinets, Bogdan Ivanskyi, our reporter."

Just a little practice here. Number two is the car has an acceleration of two meters per second squared. If the car starts from rest and accelerates for 10 seconds, how far does it travel? Well, first thing we want to do is we want to establish a positive direction so that we know which way everything's moving. So I'm going to draw a little car sitting right here at rest. I'm going to start to accelerate in that direction. I just assigned that 2 meters per second squared. And I'm going to go ahead and call that the positive direction. So now I know I'm going to find my variables. My acceleration is 2 meters per second per second. The car starts from rest. That's got some hidden value in it. Initial velocity is 0 meters per second. Accelerates for 10 seconds. That tells me a time. I want to know how far it travels. How far doesn't ask you where it ends up. It just means how far is it from where it started and that's a displacement. So I'm giving an acceleration of time and initial velocity and I'm looking for a delta x. The first kinematic equation is out because it relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration and time. The third one runs on the initial velocity. The second equation says x equals 1 half at squared plus v naught t plus x naught. If I subtract that over the other side, I can say that delta x equals 1 half at squared plus v naught t. This is happy. because my initial velocity is zero so that term drops out. I'm just left with one half, two, ten square. Super tricky problem. This is one hundred meters. At the end of the interval it'll be going twenty meters per second. It started at zero meters per second. The average of zero in twenty is ten. Ten meters per second for ten seconds is one hundred meters. So there's a couple ways you can do that. Kinematic equation is fine. How far would the car problem to have traveled in 10 seconds at the initial velocity car I've been 3 meters per second. This is where it's kind of nice to think of it like a graph but we know as it accelerates it travels 120 or 100 meters. Well let's just work out the problem and then I'll look at that. So acceleration is still 2 meters per second but this time my initial velocity is 3 meters per second. My time is still 10 I'm still looking for change in position. So I'm going to use the same equation. Change in position equals 1 half AT squared plus V naught t. But this time I have a V naught so that doesn't drop out. So this equals 1 half 2 times 10 squared plus 3 times 10. This is still 100 meters plus 30. This is like the original 30 I would have gone if I had never accelerated. Plus the 100 more I did go. So this is 130 meters total. Alright. And finally, number four. A car traveling at 30 meters per second can be stopped by brakes in the distance of 60 meters. What is the acceleration of the car? Again, we need to draw a little picture so we know what's going on. I've got a car and it's traveling this way at 30 meters per second. It's going to break which means it's going to accelerate this way at some acceleration. I don't know what it is. But this is my positive direction so I know what's going on. It's going to travel to the right 60 meters because it is moving that direction. So what do I know? I know an initial velocity, car traveling at 30 meters per second can be stopped so I know a final velocity. By the brakes and the distance of I know a change in the speed of the car. What is the acceleration of the car? I know an initial velocity, no final velocity and no change in position. I'm looking for acceleration. Looking at all my equations, I know the last one says v squared equals v not squared plus 2A delta x. I know 3 out of the 4 of those so I can say final velocity is velocity zero squared equals initial velocity thirty squared plus twice the acceleration times the change in position. So now I have nine hundred plus one twenty eight equals zero subtract over nine nine hundred and I got one twenty eight equals negative nine hundred divide both sides by one twenty and a equals negative 7.5 meters per second per second. So it makes sense the acceleration is negative. Absolutely. We're good to go.","Let's take a look at the final problems on the lab from yesterday where we went through and figured out the kinematic equations. Just a little practice here.

Sí, colaborando con la entrega recordemos que esto fue una cuestión que realizé en forma conjunta con el querente de Anzaesona Norte, Fabio Centile, donde se habían presesleccionado tres estabilicelindos secundarios de San Lorenzo, donde Estaba la escuela 439 que hoy se entrega, y han sido de la NEDU después de tanto tiempo, las 548 y 549 y en una segunda etapa la 438. Hubo una alteración del orden, hoy se entrega la 439, el día jueves la 438 y la semana siguiente creeríamos que estamos entregando la NEDU en la 548 y 549 ¿Número muy parecido, Néstor, porque la cantidad de netbooks que se están entregando también superan las 400 acá? Acá son 460 más aproximadamente. Las 438 son 1.100 computadoras que se van a entregar en una escuela grande. Es un sueño hecho en realidad para los chicos que veían entregarse las computadoras en la Provincia de Buenos Aires y en San Lorenzo decían cuándo iban a llegar. y en la disposición del gerente de Anzep, Fabio Sentile y de la gente que coordina, que trabaja con él, podemos acceder a traer las computadoras a San Lorenzo. ¿Y tu participación o en conjunto con el Safe San Lorenzo, fue hacer esta gestión justamente? Nosotros hicimos esta gestión a través de Fabio Sentile y en su momento el Anzep funcionaba, tenía un día fijo una vez por mes en el sindicato de Anzapé para atención de no solamente de las asignaciones familiares sino de todos los trámites que realiza el ANSE. Bueno, por razones ajenas al gremio eso se cortó el año pasado bueno pero que esperemos volver a retomar y bueno esto es una demostración de todo lo que se ha venido pisionando y realizando a lo largo de este tiempo. Muchas gracias. la Comisión Directiva de Anzafe, en el Instituto Salvorenzo, aquí en la Escuela 439, durante la entrega de más de 400 netbooks del Plan Conectar Igualdad. Una a una, los alumnos las están recibiendo.","Leicester Almirón, of the Anza Federica Commission of San Lorenzo, happy, I suppose, collaborating here with the delivery of netbooks in school 439. Yes, collaborating with the delivery. We remember that this was a question that I realized in a way that confronts the current of the Anzaes in the north of Favio Centile, where three secondary establishments of San Lorenzo had been pre-reasoned, where The school was 439, which is now delivered to the Neuco, after so long, the 548 and 549, and in a second stage the 438. There was an alteration of the order, today it is delivered to 439, on Thursday, 438, and the next week we would believe that we are delivering the 548 and 549, The director of the Anzafe-Cinza Lorenzo school, here in the school 439 during the delivery of more than 400 netbooks of the plan to connect equality.

Our request for political asylum is now being considered by an immigration judge in El Paso, Texas. We are confident that this process will be successful because we have presented the immigration with all of the evidence necessary to support a request for political asylum. In this case, the work was done by a Mexican national who's a correspondent for the daily Noroeste and the small town of Ascension in Chihuahua. We trust that the U.S. authorities will help us.

I, for one, am very grateful to you. I am very moved to be able to tell you this, and I sincerely want to say how much I hope to have an opportunity to play a part in Reporters Without Borders work, and to help other journalists around the globe whose lives they can save. so that they can secure their freedom and keep on playing their role as information professionals. When I entered the United States, I really hoped that authorities would grant such an urgent request for humanitarian aid, which did not happen. I finally ended up in a detention camp that I had to endure for seven months because my only choice was to be in prison or to go back and face the Mexican state. By returning to Mexico with them, I would have run the risk of losing my life immediately and were still leaving my son without help. It was very hard to stay seven months in this prison to witness annoying practices on the part of the immigration services and the contract guards of a security working with this El Paso detention camp and especially to see, in addition to my own hardships, those experienced by some 100 people, including some Americans and other illegal immigrants, who had been separated from their families. It is extremely sad to realize that your children are on this side of the border and that they will have to return to Mexico to face a totally different demographic reality from the lifestyle on the US side. That was really catastrophic. It's something that one does not forget and that should service to give meaning to our lives. What I meant to say is that if you truly feel that your life is in danger, you can ask for help from and count on reporters without borders, and PMEX, periodistas, mexicanos, and el exilio, Mexican journalists in exile, which has a representative in El Paso, Texas, lawyer Carlos Spector. We are really well aware that corruption in Mexico exists in the highest ranks of government, even at the level of the president of the republic, who is backed by the Mexican Army, and the Army's only code of conduct is brutality. I believe that the lives of all journalists are more important than having to endure and tolerate the abuse of acts of the Mexican state. They need to turn to Reporters Without Borders, and if necessary, to PMEX for legal counsel and to support when having to face seven months of detention like I had to do. If I had not fled Mexico, I would probably be among the statistics of homicides, disappearances, or false imprisonments for which the Mexican state is responsible. My plans for the future?

We have Intervoid spawning as the blue Protoss player on the north-hand side of Scrap Station. Meanwhile we have KHB spawning as the red Terran player. So Intervoid and KHB now going to go ahead and just say good luck, have fun to each other. I've been going through so many of these high professional replays and I'm having a hard time trying to figure out some games that I have cast and some games that I have not. This is one of the games that I have not cast or otherwise no one's gonna hear this. And you quote-unquote capture as a Naga Watchtower fairly quickly. Probe now running through those vents and going to go ahead and just head up that ramp. SCV now going to go ahead and scurry back down as well. Taking a look at the KHB right now. KHB really delayed that command or that Barracks. A little bit surprised by that. Now finally building that Barracks. Probe not trying to take that down. And I need to pause this game for a second. Hold on. Alright, so here's this game right now. SCV trying to take down that Probe. Probe and SCV trying to Duke it out right there. Probe is going to be on the losing end of that fight as that probe is down to 10 hit points already. But taking one more hit and down it goes. Oh that probe had a chance to escape but no decided to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Gateway now being warped in as well trying to take down the single pylon. Another pylon being warped in on that backhand side. Intervoid no gas yet so it looks as though he may be trying to go Mass Zellets. Oh very nice micro from KHB. KHB using Perhaps using some mineral pathing in order to try to just escape that surround from those probes. Now moving back around so that SCV just doing a very good job of just escaping that probe right there and that probe SCV now coming back around that corner able to escape once again and that probe just doing the spending a lot of time chasing. Look back over here we have a single marine being trained up and now orbital command being built up by KHB. This single SCV still trying to move out around that map trying to just continue to We have two zealots on that front door so those zealots made in fact try to chase it down and now we finally oh Down goes out scv so scouting scv taking a little bit to have a corner and getting taken down We have a cybernetic score being warped in by and being warped in by inter void and now in a simulator With currently two probes on it should probably get a third probe on there if in fact He's going to be trying to go from stalkers a stalker takes a 50 gas at this point and marines still being produced a factory now being put down by KHB. So KHB going for the mech strategy as opposed to the infantry strategy that I've seen a lot of Korean players recently go. And SEV still being trained up. Taking a look at the SEV count here. We have 17 SEVs right there. And oh wow, I pulled up the message log. Okay, trying to go ahead and pull up the unit right there. So it's 20 probes versus 17 SEVs and a single mule and a bunker being built. So I think this is the first time I've seen KHB build a bunker. Perhaps those bunkers are in fact stronger than I believe. Factory now put down and now a starport. So a starport being built by that single SCV right there. As that factory not producing any units, KHB sitting at 25 over 27 food needs to produce an additional supply depot soon. Intervoid is not researching that warp gate yet. So a little bit surprised by that. I thought warp gate would have been one of those earlier things to research as it really just improves how fast these gateways and produce units. Secondary starport being put down. So, okay, it should be going dual starport and now building supply depot in the back of the base. Orbital command still trying to summon as many mules, trying to get that economy up. Sitting on 24 probes of just 21 with that mule. And now uplifted is that starport. Where is that starport going? It's just floating in the air right there. No real tech lab switches that it can really go for. No tech lab being built by that factory so that Starport most likely gonna swap with that factory in order to start producing banshees. I did set my affinity so no reason why that this lag shouldn't be happening and no units are getting killed that's not a very very high point of the game perhaps I should no longer try to live stream my shoutcast to improve the quality of my shoutcast. Banshee now being produced in a single secondary banshee being produced as well. So two banshees and now we have is he gonna go scouting with that factory He in fact is scouting with that factory. That's gonna be a little bit dangerous Scouting with the factory as in fact there are three stalkers in play now. No still no warp gate research is that a robotics facility? No stargate Oh intro void going for a stargate getting a quick scanner sweep of this area and KHB it means mainly to rethink his strategy at this point as Banshees are not gonna be that good especially if if intro void does in fact try to go void or not void raise Phoenix's and Phoenix is a very very good air to air unit banshees obviously lacking any air to air attack at all we have all of those stalkers and those zealots now trying to take down these destructible rocks right here those destructible rocks will be destroyed in just a moment and there's also a secondary set of destructible rocks on this other side as well so that's about 4,000 damage that needs to be dealt in order for these units to really make it over I do not see any siege tanks yet another barracks and now we have some So, Vikings being produced instead of banshees right now, Vikings produced in order to supplement the void rays. And now here comes that stalker. Oh, down goes that pylon. Obviously, to have taken some damage earlier. Void Raid now being produced by that Stargate, also using that chrono boost ability. Zealots and these stalkers not moving in to destroy the secondary set of rocks. A little bit surprised by that. Oh, here they come. So now Zealots and stalkers coming in. and destroy the second set of rocks. These rocks will go down in just a moment. And now we have more barracks being produced and an additional tech lab. The additional tech add-on on that tech lab taking I believe what 30? The build time is 30 in this particular patch. And yeah, I want to get some more recent high level play. And just because it didn't find out much more interesting now, Banshee's coming in and those Vikings coming in as well. I need to watch that minimap a little bit more. Stalker's doing a good job of just trying to keep track and trying to push back any of those attacks from a single void raid was produced but that void raid was destroyed so that void raid most likely shot down by those by those Vikings earlier but a Viking was taken down as well so SCVs coming off the line trying to repair some of these units SCVs also have that auto repair feature so it is much easier for those SCVs to repair than before an engineering bay has been built but there are no turrets currently in play that I can see anywhere on the map couple marauders couple Marines in a bunker and now we have have more stalkers perhaps trying to press in on this front door. We'll see if there's any observers. No robotics facility at this time. Gateway still. So a triple gateway with a stargate but currently low on pylon so unable to build any more units right now. Pylons being built on the back here and here because pylons will be finished warping in in just a second. So there they are. A forge being built as well so perhaps we'll see a little bit of a weapon upgrade and a robotics facility being placed now being transferred over. That's a fair amount of SEVs. Wow. What is that? 16, 19 SEVs now being transferred over this position. Now down to a mere 17 SEVs. Nexus being put down into play here with double assimilators as both players trying to take that natural expansion. Void rate or a couple, excuse me, a couple low hit point units that were taken down earlier. Army sizes are 87 versus 85. So both sides pretty even in terms of what have been able to mass at this point in the game, orbital command still calling down mules perhaps so call down another mule or he will try to do a scanner sweep. Triple Barracks gonna go for quadruple Barracks in just a moment. Stay tuned for part two and the conclusion of this replay between KHB and Intervoid here on Scrap Station.","Hello everyone, this is Quota giving you a shout cast between KHB and Intervoid here on ScrapStation. We have Intervoid spawning as the blue Protoss player on the north-hand side of ScrapStation. Meanwhile, we have KHB spawning as the red Terran player. So Intervoid and KHB now going to go ahead and just say, good luck, have fun to each other. I've been going through so many of these high professional replays and I'm having a hard time trying to figure out some games that I have cast and some games I have not. This is one of the games that I have not cast or otherwise no one's gonna hear this. And you quote-unquote capture as a Naga Watchtower fairly quickly. Probe now running through those vents and going to go ahead and just head up that ramp. SCV now going to go ahead and scurry back down as well. Taking a look at the KHB right now. KHB really delayed that command or that barracks. A little bit surprised by that. Now finally building that barracks. Probe not trying to take that down. And I need to pause this game for a second. Hold on. Alright so here's this game right now. SCV trying to take down that probe. Probe and SCV trying to Duke it out right there. Probe is going to be on the losing end of that fight as that probe is down to 10 hit points already. But taking one more hit and down it goes. Oh that probe had a chance to escape but no decided to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Gateway now being warped in as well trying to take down the single pylon. Another pylon being warped in on that backhand side. Intervoid no gas yet so it looks as though he may be trying to go Mass Zellets. Oh very nice micro from KHB. KHB using Perhaps using some mineral pathing in order to try to just escape that surround from those probes. Now moving back around so that SCV just doing a very good job of just escaping that probe right there and that probe SCV now coming back around that corner able to escape once again and that probe just doing the spending a lot of time chasing. Look back over here we have a single marine being trained up and now orbital command being built up by KHB. This single SCV still trying to move out around that map trying to just continue to We have two zealots on that front door so those zealots made in fact try to chase it down and now we finally oh Down goes out scv so scouting scv taking a little bit to have a corner and getting taken down We have a cybernetic score being warped in by and being warped in by inter void and now in a simulator With currently two probes on it should probably get a third probe on there if in fact He's going to be trying to go from stalkers a stalker takes 50 gas at this point and marines still being produced a factory now being put down by KHB. So KHB going for the mech strategy as opposed to the infantry strategy that I've seen a lot of Korean players recently go. And SEV still being trained up. Taking a look at the SEV count here. We have 17 SEVs right there. And oh wow, I pulled up the message log. Okay, trying to go ahead and pull up the unit right there. So it's 20 probes versus 17 SEVs and a single mule and a bunker being built. So I think this is the first time I've seen KHB build a bunker. Perhaps those bunkers are in fact stronger than I believe. Factory now put down and now a starport. So a starport being built by that single SCV right there. As that factory not producing any units, KHB sitting at 25 over 27 food needs to produce an additional supply depot soon. Intervoid is not researching that warp gate yet. So a little bit surprised by that. I thought warp gate would have been one of those earlier things to research as it really just improves how fast these gateways and produce units. that factory so that Starport most likely going to swap with that factory in order to start producing banshees. I did set my affinity so no reason why that this lag shouldn't be happening and no units are getting killed that's not a very very high point of the game perhaps I should no longer try to live stream my shoutcast to improve the quality of my shoutcast. Banshee now being produced in a single secondary banshee being produced as well. So two banshees and now we have is he going to go scouting with that factory He in fact is scouting with that factory. That's gonna be a little bit dangerous Scouting with the factory as in fact there are three stalkers in play now. No still no warp gate research is that a robotics facility? No stargate Oh intro void going for a stargate getting a quick scanner sweep of this area and KHB it means mainly to rethink his strategy at this point as Banshees are not gonna be that good especially if if intro void does in fact try to go void or not void raise Phoenix's and Phoenix is a very very good air-to-air unit banshees obviously lacking any air-to-air attack at all. We have all of those stalkers and those zealots now trying to take down these destructible rocks right here. Those destructible rocks will be destroyed in just a moment and there's also a secondary set of destructible rocks on this other side as well so that's about 4,000 damage that needs to be dealt in order for these units to really make it over. I do not see any siege tanks yet. Another barracks and now we have some So, Vikings being produced instead of banshees right now, Vikings produced in order to supplement the void rays. And now here comes that stalker. Oh, down goes that pylon. Obviously, to have taken some damage earlier. Void ray now being produced by that stargate. Also using that chrono boost ability. Zealots and these stalkers not moving in to destroy the secondary set of rocks. A little bit surprised by that. Oh, here they come. So now Zealots and stalkers coming in. and destroy the second set of rocks. These rocks will go down in just a moment. And now we have more barracks being produced and an additional tech lab. The additional tech add-on on that tech lab taking I believe what 30, the build time is 30 in this particular patch. And yeah, I want to get some more recent high level play just because it didn't find out much more interesting. Now Banshee's coming in, Angel's Viking's coming in as well. I need to watch that minimap a little bit more. Stalker's doing a good job of just trying to keep track and trying to push back any of those attacks from the enemy. a single void raid was produced but that void raid was destroyed so that void raid most likely shot down by those by those Vikings earlier but a Viking was taken down as well so SCVs coming off the line trying to repair some of these units SCVs also have that auto repair feature so it is much easier for those SCVs to repair than before an engineering bay has been built but there are no turrets currently in play that I can see anywhere on the map couple marauders couple Marines in a bunker and now we have have more stalkers perhaps trying to press in on this front door.

So perhaps we'll see a little bit of a weapon upgrade. And a robotics facility being placed. Damage Banshee is now up in the air with those Vikings as well. A bunker has been is being salvaged and there it goes and salvaging that bunker and getting some of those minerals and those resources back as those Banshee's are now moving out once again. Missile turret trying to fight and now we have a command center being lifted off and trying to take this expansion. Very very nice army that will be able to hold this choke point. Doing a little bit of a patrol here with these units making sure that there are no stalkers and no zealots in position. now being transferred over. That's a fair amount of SCVs. Wow. What is that? 16, 19 SCVs now being transferred over. This position now down to a mere 17 SCVs. Nexus being put down into play here with double assimilators as both players trying to take that natural expansion. Void rate, or a couple, excuse me, a couple low hit point units that were taken down earlier. Army sizes are 87 versus 85. So both sides pretty even in terms of what have been able to mass at this point in the game, orbital command still calling down mules, perhaps he'll call down another mule or he will try to do a scanner sweep. But triple Barracks, gonna go for quadruple Barracks in just a moment. Stay tuned for part two and the conclusion of this replay between KHB and Intervoid here on Scrap Station."

Und nun brauchst du was anderes. Und bist du in Pankzhon oder in Ruiz-Stand? Nee, Ruiz-Stand, nee, Ruiz-Stand. Aber du da ist was. Ich bin... Ich bin... Ich bin... Ich bin... Ich bin... Ich hab mit Fernsehen Herr Begrupp, ich mochte Nachrichten, ich schrieb Bücher und Geschichten und hab nötchen Verlach. Was hat du in Bücher? Ach, ich schrieb über Romantik und Lyrik. Ich bin ein Goat, aber Romantik. Was für Romantik? Nein, Nürric ist nicht tot. Nein, ich bin nicht sech. Ich hab dir ein bisschen Leucie Bokrut geben über Georg von der Ring. Der Konkuit braucht. Entschuldig erst mal. Ich hab ihm falsch verstanden. Ich mein, nicht gemeint, Nürric ist tot. Ganz im Gegenteil. Entschuldigung. Dann nehm ich den auch nicht für Övel. Aber es ist gut. Nein, Romantik. Nein, ich will über Romantik was hören. Was schiffst du dort? Ähm, ich schief, äh, ich schief, äh, Über das, was in der Romantik ähnlich, wie würden vielleicht die Tütscherin verklärt worden ist, Eichendorf oder so. Aber wenn du genau hinkickst und die mit Eichendorff befauten da ist, dann merkst du, das ist ein ganz fröh'n Grün. Ja. Ja, es war. Kann die da, kann das hier nicht erlutführen, aber das kannst du mir erst mal glöben. Und die hätte natürlich ein ganzes Bar, Down dafür, dass man, ich sag mal, ein vernünftiger Gehaltung als Mensch kriegen wir und kriegt. Und Aldi Lydee in der Romantik, die sich engagiert habt, die habt ja endlich noch gar keine richtige Möglichkeit, hat so etwas wie, Main von Freeto geben oder zu schrieben, was sie will, Goethe oder Schiller, die habt immer ob Shakespeare, Keaton, was für Figuren, die in sie Literatur schafft hat, damit sie Ja. Wie Eichendorf möglich wären die, die molst du nur wieder in den Böken, no? Und dann... Ich mach mir das ganz einfach. Ich fraue Löw, was denkst du über Eichendorf? Ich mich das, was du am leesten von einem Lesen oder Kennenden da ist. Und dann mog ich so ein legit Interview, das ist nur immer das Einfachste, dass ich Löw fraue und die Arbeit machen. Und dann traue ich das zusammen. Und das Schöne ist, wie Georg van der Brink mit München Kontakt hat, die sich, wie kommen sie denn auf den, den kennt doch kein Mensch. Das ist nicht wahr. Aber wo lang der Brut bist du ein Pfund mehr? Schwarze Gelhauer und so wieder so zu stöcken Grön nicht gut. Aber das ist interessant, weil du mich verortest, mit was befortest du die. Aber wirklich die ganze Weg durch die und bin wie Rotary durch die engagiert. Also, die habe ich endlich nie. Aber mit der Romantiksyktopopforten, das wirkt jeden ein Tatleng, weil der nicht blutdösig, süden Krumm ist. Dann ist wirklich fehlt, dass wir uns von da auch noch wichtig werden. Da ist möglich, dass der Kind Sorgen macht, dass die Stoff gut geilt. Vielen Dank.","You are talking about the people you love and love that you have maintained. And now you need something different. Are you in Pankjohn or in Ruiz? No, not Ruiz. No, Ruiz. But you know something. I'm... I'm... No, no, no. It's different. I'll just talk about it later. I have... With TV, Mr. Bikopör, I want to tell you something. I write books and stories and have a little laugh. What do you tell people about books? What do you say? I write about romance and lyrics. Romantic, what for? No, no, no. Lürich is not dead. I gave you a little bit of a Lycian folk song about Georg von der Ring. I apologize for that. I misunderstood it. I didn't mean Lürich is dead. Not at all. Sorry. Romantic. I don't take it for granted. Romantic is dead. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic.

Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Romantic. Rom And I think that's what's in the Romantic. Maybe you could say that Eichendorf is being used. But if you look closely and you see it with the Eichendorf, you'll notice that it's a very early green. And yes, it was. I can't feel it here, but you can lie to me for a moment. And of course it would have a whole bar down for that. and that the content was less. And Alde Lyde in the Romantic had a lot of commitment. He had no real possibility of writing, writing, what he wanted, Goethe or Schiller. He always had a lot of ideas about Shakespeare, what kind of figures he had in his literature, And that would not have been so easy. A woman could not be anything and a man could not be a widow if she was a soldier or a servant of the archbishop. And that is what interests me because that is blood 140, almost 200 years ago. And what would have been the society in this time taught by Arans and where democratic and how they were treated. But the characters, the figures, the That's not true. But where did you find the brook? Black, yellow, gray, and so on, green, not red. But that's interesting, because you continue with what you do. But really, the whole way through, and I'm engaged in the library, I've never had a title, but with the romantic sector, that really works. Because it's not blue-dosing, blue-sweet, chrome, then it's really a fail, because we still have to be really careful. If possible, the child will have to worry about the Stoff-Ut-Guide, and so on. No, not yet. Thank you."

Quindi io scrivo ma non importa se il pubblico non mi sente, io scrivo per me stesso e questo parlo anche di sto causa, di tutti i grandi sperimentatori che dovevano poi avere una proseguimento del loro studio nella gente, cioè essere messi a confronti molto di più, mentre gli abbonamenti e le cose che si sono sempre fatte, si fanno tutt'ora, tra nevo e il poro Berio che ha cercato di cambiare, non contemplano la musica nuova e quindi sono rimasti staccati e hanno isolati dalla gente, uno isolato non può creare cose buone, uno che scrive e hanno perso il respiro, hanno perso Fiat, anche Bulesa, hanno perso l'ossigeno proprio. Si sono rinchiuti a fare celluline musicali assolutamente anzite che non parlano. è stato un grande compositore contemporaneo.","Let's imagine a Giovanna Marini in 2050-2060, who is trying to style a song of our current state, in a time when the disc industry produces many songs and there is no need to search for a oral tradition, there are photographic supports, ICD, etc. There are some songs that she would save in 2050 to explain today. So, I would save Frank Zappa immediately, I would shoot you out immediately. Because, in my opinion, there is a lack of classical music to absorb vital elements in itself. Unfortunately, our contemporary classical music lacks the breath, it has been dead for a long time. There was also a strong vital infa, I wrote about this, I also talk about this cause, of all the great experimenters, that had to have a continuation of their study in people. While the subscriptions and the things that were done, that are always done, are still being done, among the poor Berlio who tried to change them, do not contemplate new music. And therefore they are stuck and isolated from the people. One isolated cannot create good things, one that writes. And they lost their breath, they lost their breath, even their breath, they lost their oxygen. They are even forced to make absolutely addicted musical celluline, which they do not talk about. It was a great contemporary composer."

Donc aujourd'hui je vous parle du FindPix F300XR. Donc le FindPix F300XR qui est une nouveauté, qu'on vient de sortir cette année 2010 pour l'automne. Donc c'est un appareil extraordinaire, un appareil vraiment spécial qu'on sort sur le marché cette année. Donc un successeur de l'alignée EXR, donc avec le capteur Super CCD EXR qui va s'ajouter à tous les types d'éclairage. Donc la spécificité de cet appareil-là, c'est que c'est un appareil photocompact super qui va vous offrir un zoom 15x et dans un boîtier compact, donc un appareil que vous allez être capable de glisser dans votre poche ou dans votre sac à main. Donc ce que je vais faire aujourd'hui c'est que je vais faire ouverture de la boîte avec vous. On va regarder ce qui vient avec l'appareil et ensuite de ça on va faire le tour des boutons et des fonctions de l'appareil. Donc boite blanche parce que c'est un appareil de pré-production, donc qui ne sont pas encore sur le marché. Donc on voulait juste vous donner une idée de qu'est-ce que l'appareil va offrir. Donc première chose que vous allez recevoir lorsque vous allez ouvrir la boîte évidemment, manuez l'instruction carte de garantie, toutes les informations, documentation pour vous pour enregistrer votre appareil photo et obtenir la garantie de deux ans, Fujifilm a fait seulement au Canada. Ensuite de ça, vous avez la courroie de poignets, attaché ça à votre appareil photo, bien important et qui va vous permettre de prendre votre appareil photo, peu importe où est-ce que vous allez. Donc l'appareil photo vient évidemment avec le câble USB qui va vous permettre de télécharger vos photos à votre ordinateur et votre câble AV qui va vous permettre de voir vos photos, sur votre téléviseur. Donc les deux câblons, une sortie USB, donc les deux vont être sur l'appareil photo de la même sortie et vous n'allez pas aussi les mettre télévision et ordinateur. Donc l'appareil photo se recharge aussi avec une pile NP-50, donc pile rechargeable ultiam, et vous avez aussi le chargeur de batterie. Donc comme c'est ici, il fait juste le mettre et le même extension mûre et ensuite de ça vous êtes capable de faire de recharger vos batteries donc on va voir aussi de quoi l'appareil, de quoi le F-300 a excert à l'air donc et voilà donc c'est un appareil série F un peu le même type d'appareil, même dimension un appareil récapteur et excert comme je vous disais donc ce que je vais faire c'est que je vais faire un tour des différents passades de l'appareil donc si on regarde le devant de l'appareil donc vous avez l'objectif, un objectif 15x donc 24 à 360 mm donc 24 c'est un appareil qui est très grand temps qui va vous permettre vraiment de prendre des photos avec une nette beaucoup plus dans le cadre. Ensuite de ça on a l'illuminateur d'assistance de mise au point donc la minuterie et vous avez ici aussi vous avez comme un peu une poignée ou un caoutchouc qui va vous permettre d'avoir vraiment d'être confortable sur l'appareil et d'avoir une bonne poignée sur l'appareil. Donc côté gauche rien d'intéressant. droit de l'appareil. Donc si on ouvre le port ici, donc comme je vous disais, vous avez la sortie ici USB pour ploguer à la fois votre câble USB et votre câble AV. Et vous avez aussi le port HDMI parce que c'est un appareil qui va prendre des vidéos et photos en haut de définition. Donc voilà ensuite de ça on va regarder le derrière de l'appareil donc le derrière d'un appareil de trois écrans ACL de 3.5 pouces. Ensuite de ça j'ai la molette de mot qui va me d'accéder à mes menus donc M, en, S, P, EXR, menu avancé et mes positions de scène aussi. Ensuite de ça j'ai la touche à lecture pour revoir mes photos. Boutons access directs pour faire des vidéos. Très appréciés lorsqu'on veut faire des vidéos pour vous en changer la molette de mode. Vous pouvez directement accéder à ce mode avec ce bouton. Donc on a aussi à l'arrière un bouton qui est nouveau qui s'appelle le bouton la touche de sélection et de commande. Donc si vous vous permettez de faire votre sélection, vous allez sélectionner macro, d'aller aussi sélectionner le flash, la minuterie ainsi que d'aller effacer vos photos mais qui va vous permettre aussi si vous êtes en mode manuel par exemple, si vous décidez de prendre des photos et que vous devez accéder au mode de la vitesse d'opturation ou à l'ouverture, vous n'avez pas accéder directement donc vous n'avez pas besoin d'aller à travers les menus pour changer ces deux paramètres. Ensuite de ça on a le bouton retour et display donc c'est votre bouton qui va vous permettre d'affaire et vous avez le bouton F qui va vous permettre de changer les photos en noir et blanc, le mode de fil mais qui va aussi vous permettre de changer le ISO sur votre appareil. Donc si on regarde au-dessus de l'appareil ici on a la station pour le trépied et on a aussi la porte qui va vous permettre d'insérer la batterie donc je vais vous montrer comment insérer la batterie donc orange à orange j'insère la batterie de cette manière dans l'appareil et je vais vous montrer comment insérer la batterie. j'ai aussi une carte SDH ou carte SDH, haute capacité peu importe l'appareil est compatible avec les deux. Donc ce que je vais faire c'est que je vais insérer la carte mémoire, refermer la porte et ensuite je suis prêt à prendre des photos. Donc ce que je vais faire c'est que je vais vous montrer le dessus de l'appareil maintenant. Donc vous avez le microphone ici et vous avez aussi le bouton pour mettre l'appareil sur tension, donc bouton on off qu'on appelle et vous avez aussi la commande de zoom pour être capable de prendre des photos. Ce qu'on va faire aussi avec le haut-parleur aussi, ici, donc ce qu'on va faire, c'est que on va mettre l'appareil sous tension et voilà. Donc là ce que je mets l'appareil sous tension, le zoom sort, j'ai aussi le flash donc c'est un flash pop-up qu'on appelle donc c'est pas un flash qui va être intégré directement à l'appareil, c'est un flash qui va sortir donc un peu plus de puissance. Et ensuite de ça je suis prêt à prendre les photos juste à faire mes mises au point et l'appareil va prendre les photos. Donc c'est un peu les et les fonctions sur le F300. Donc, juste vous rappeler, appareil photo compact, Superzoom 15X, donc une portée de 24 à 30, 360 millimètres, pardon, avec plein de fonctions qui vont vraiment vraiment prendre des photos extraordinaires. C'est un appareil qui est pas tout à fait d'entrée de gamme et qui est beaucoup plus de, qui est un peu un appareil champion de la gamme, ce qu'on pourrait dire. Toutes les fonctions et toutes les meilleures technologies de Fujifilm sont dans cet appareil. Donc, vraiment, vous permet de prendre des photos qui vont avoir une qualité d'image impeccable. Donc, c'était Évillie, l'Expert Fuji pour le Findpix F300 EXR. Je vous souhaite une bonne journée.","Hello everyone, this is Emily, the FUJI expert. Today I'm talking about the FINPEX F300 EXR. The FINPEX F300 EXR is a new product released in 2010 for the autumn. It's an extraordinary device, a really special device that we released on the market this year. It's a successor to the EXR line, with the Super CCD EXR sensor that will be added to all types of lighting. The specificity of this device is that it's a very compact, super compact camera. I will open the box with you. We will see what comes with the device. Then we will do the buttons and functions of the device. So white glass because it is a pre-production device. They are not yet on the market. So we just wanted to give you an idea of what the device is going to offer. So the first thing you will see when you go to open the box, obviously, is the manual. So you will see that the manual is not yet on the box. You can find the registration card, all the documentation information for you to take a picture of your camera and get the 2 years warranty that Fujifilm has done only in Canada. Then you have the wristband attached to your camera, very important and that will allow you to take your camera, no matter where you go. So the camera comes obviously with the USB cable that will allow you to charge your photos to your computer and your AV cable that will allow you to see your photos. The two cables have a USB port. Both will be on the camera of the same output. And you will not also have the televised and audio meter. The camera also charges with a 50 MP battery. So the multi-amp recharge battery. And you also have the battery charger. and then you can charge your batteries. So we will also see what the f-300 is like. And that's it. So it's a series F device, a little bit the same type of device, same size. A device with recaptor and XR as I told you. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a tour of the different passes of the device. So if we look at the front of the device, you have the objective, an objective, 15x, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 x 360 mm, 24 The USB port is also available. You can access the menu, so you can see the buttons, buttons and the buttons to make videos. You can also select flash, mini-tree and go to erase your photos. But it will also allow you to take photos manually. For example, if you decide to take photos and you have to access the shutter speed or to the aperture, you will not be able to access directly. So you will not be able to go through the menus to change these two parameters. Then we have the button return and display. So it is your button that will allow you to You can also display the elements on the ACL screen. You have the F button, which will allow you to change the black and white photos, the mode of the film, and also the ISO on your device. If we look above the device, we have the stand for the tripod, and we also have the door that will allow you to insert the battery. I will show you how to insert the battery, orange to orange. I insert the battery in this way in the device. I also have a SD card or SDHCO capacity. No matter what, the device is compatible with both. So what I'm going to do is that I will insert the memory card, close the door and then I am ready to take pictures. So what I'm going to do is that I'm going to show you above the device right now. So you have the microphone here and you also have the button to put the device on and off. So the button on and off that we call and you also have the zoom command. You can also use the speaker or the heatsink. You can also use the power button. and the functions on the F300. So just remind you, the camera, the camera, compact, super zoom, 15x, so a 24 to 30, 360 mm holder, sorry, with a lot of functions that will really make you take extraordinary photos. It's a camera that is not quite in the range of range, but which is a little more, which is a little bit like a champion camera of the range, what could we say. All the functions and all the best technology of Fujifilm are in this camera. so you can take pictures that will have an impeccable image quality. So it was Évillie, the Foodie expert for the Finepix F300 EXR. Have a good day!"

Because he has your hand and with so much understanding always finds a word friend that fills us with emotion. You do not agree with anything, but it is worth gold for your simple way, the title of a mildee and for transmitting so much peace, always valuing who is not playing with peace. And besides that, there are other characteristics in you that they share and that I would like to your smile, be with the cause, your look, be back to any place, your heart, that when opens, your soul, that makes me want to travel with you, your smile, envelops my body, my soul, my heart, and my heat as a blanket, that cold night, your look, give your look, especially when he is back to me.

I couldn't believe it myself. However the signs of impending doom, excuse me, MODERNIZATION, are quite obvious. The basement renovation is in progress; they have started off with the Catalog Store and the area in front of the 1985 Dover Oildraulic, which incidentally and unexpectedly IS being modernized. I should throw a champagne party in favor of it's well-received demise. Sadly, the bigger Dovers will indeed be gone soon.     Thanks to the renovation both the employee lounge and the doors separating you from the employee elevator have been removed, and much of the basement's merchandise has been transplanted to other departments. Hence, the basement level was quieter than The Source on a Sunday in football season, thus making the employee lift incredibly easy to get on. If you get here like TOMORROW you just might get your last ride too.    They have been modernized twice in their history, once in 1985, by Dover, to separate them and give the employee a new call button, and both elevators new COP's. The other modernization was done by Montgomery KONE in 1998, to install KONE sensors and a capacity label.    Brand: Who else but Dover?

Por meio de uma paródia da música ""Esse cara sou eu"" (Roberto Carlos), que recebeu o nome de ""Três caras e eu"", o vídeo contrasta a Zona Urbana e Zona Rural, sendo possível observar as características geográficas destes dois meios e visualizar as diferenças entre eles, como os sujeitos de cada um, hábitos, paisagem, condições de vida, etc.  A história narrada pelos versos da paródia possui dois personagens principais: o ""cara"" do meio rural e o ""cara"" do meio urbano, cada qual dentro de seu espaço geográfico e suas especificidades, e ambos disputando o coração de uma donzela.   O vídeo conta com a participação de Laisla Karime, Maira Heidrich, Maria José Monteiro, Simone Barth e Tamires Cenci Dias, acadêmicas da 7ª fase do curso de Pedagogia da UNIDAVI, ano 2013.","Três caras e eu, UNIDAVI, paródia, Zona Urbana, Esse cara sou eu, Cidade, Pedagogia, modos de vida, Campo, Zona Rural",4622,14,3,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/Wnj8oop4z9c.mp3,"É necessário?

The difference is that the rural area is urban, because in urban we see more buildings, more buildings, and in rural areas there is more vegetation, there is more work, in urban areas there is more industry, pollution. And it is closer to the animals that are in the rural area, and more contact with the animals. Without the contact, the area is more pure. I think now we have an idea of what to do. So let's start? So let's go! It's done! It's done! It started! I think so! Now it's done! Yeah, because this part is what I'm talking about! Cut it!"

Here I have a slide of teaching content all about the Bank bailout program. And on the next slide I want to add an instant question. So I'm going to drag out my picture of the Royal Bank of Scotland. And the particular question I'm asking is what percentage of RBS is now owned by the UK taxpayer? I go to the smart response button within the notebook software and simply ask for a multiple choice question. I can now add in the possible alternatives. So I'm going to ask the students, is it 30%? Is it 50%? 70%? Or is it 90%? Because this is an instant question, the students are already answering on their handsets and the answers are coming in. If I want to check how many students are yet to answer, I can open the smart response tab, hit show and see that actually we're still waiting for two students. I'm sure they'll be sending their answers in quite soon. Once all the students have finished I can stop the question. What that will do is that will actually give me the results which shows me that actually on this occasion 66% of the students have decided that the answer is 70%. Great news for me because that's actually the correct answer. Using smart response you can also generate a quiz of more structured content if you want to test learners in detail. You can do this using the wizard tool or you can even import questions from another piece of software such as Microsoft Word. So here's my credit crunch quiz and you can actually see there are the answers, the questions that the students are going to answer. Once they've answered the questions you are able to review the results by individual question including if you want the actual detail of how individual students did, whether they got it right or wrong. Crucially, I can also review the results of the entire quiz. So this very important graphic shows me the questions which have been answered well compared to those which have been answered less well. Another feature of Smart Response is the grey book as it allows you to select an individual student and compare how they've been doing over time with the class average. Smart Response The response is the ideal tool for assessment in the classroom. I can generate questions on the fly to control the flow of the lesson and keep it pacey and when I need to I can also create a structured quiz to test in detail how well students have understood my teaching.","Smart Response makes it easy to generate questions to immediately engage learners in the lesson.

Mitä se tuo tullessa? Huuntoorchesteria ja valtavaa vastuuta huippuosaamista ja huippuakustista taloa on tuonut Pähkinäkuoressa. Se on sanon kuvaavatonta systeemissä. Se on 130 musikkoa ja se on yksi dynamisimpi orchestreita Unkarissa. Meillä on musikferänissä viinissä. Sarkrabin lisinski talossa vierailukonsertti ja meillä on oma saaria budapästi päätalossa eli ikään kuin Helsingin musikitalossa oli kuuden konsertin saaria. Osaamista on Calviathan symfoniaan, Kera ja Sibeliuksen, Bellias ja Melisand. Kuvin heijasteetun ja Suomainen orkesteri pieni, mutta pippurinen. Eli näytämme omaa hyvä osaamista heille. Mutta siellä on myös toisenlaista osaamista. Siellä on Grandiö, Maininkia ja kun voit kuvitella 130 soittaja, niin voi valita sieltä, kuinka ison kokonpanon vaan. Kirjoillaan auki ja sieltä poimia tehdään ensi vuonna satu- ja mitologia-teemalla koko vuoden konsertit ja keskittyen enemmänkin saksalaisen vagneriaadisiin ja strausin musiikkiin, mutta myös unohtamatta skandinavista. Seuraavaan teitä tuolla on uunkarissa riittävästi. Mitäs lappeeranta jääkö se sivu teki? Nyt en minä hyvää ystävää jätä missään tapauksessa, vaan ytelletään optiovuotta, 12-13, ja sen jäkinen ei ole vielä muuttua mitä tehdään, mutta en ainakaan jätä heitä suosiolla. En jätä, koska täällä on omaa loistavaa osaamista ja jätä, mutta jos jätä heitä, niin ei ole suosiolla. Ja pientä ongelmien kautta tämä pipuuden joukko kasaa itse. Se joka kerta, joka viikko uudelleen, joka on minun mielestä hämmästyyttävä ja kyllä näyttää siltä, että jaksetaan. Tosin hyvin.","I'm a former master of piano and piano in this wonderful orchestra. What brings you here? I'm a member of the band Huippu and I'm from Huippu-Akusti. I've been to Pähkinäkuor. It's a photo studio, a system with 130 musicians. It's one of the most dynamic orchestras in the orchestra. We have a music club in Viinissa. We have a concert in Zagreb's Lisinski village. We have our own concert in Budapest's main village. We have a concert in Kuuden in the music village of Helsinki. We have our own live orchestra. It has been in the band for four years. It is also a rickshaw because the Lappeenrannan orchestra is there. I write songs, I write songs, and I play the piano. I play the piano in the first year of my life. I play the whole year with the theme of satu and mythology. I focus more on the German Wagnerian and Straussian music, but also on the Scandinavian music. You are doing the song in Hungary. How do you do it in the Lapeeramta? and many other pictures. But we knew that when we arrived in Lapland. We wanted to see the cars in front of us, so we didn't have to worry about anything. We just had to decide what to do next year, the year 2012 or 2013. We didn't know what to do, but we always left them behind. We don't leave them behind because there are some parts of the world that are not so good. And through the performance, this little boy is supporting it every time, every week, again. Which is, in my opinion, a great pleasure. And it does look like we're sharing it. Very good."

Later that night, the janitor comes in, there's a power outage, he likes himself a match and... He's cooking fish sticks! Now, here's another all too common danger in the classroom. The movie projector. Sure! Looks like fun, but it can be very, very deadly. You go to flood this baby in and you just happen to be soaking your bunions in a bucket of water. Shall we study its basic elements? You've got paper, and you've got paint. I'm deadly culmination! Let me show you. Let's just say for the sake of argument that the Earth is being occupied by strange, crab-like creatures from another planet. One of them needs a life. You whip out your zippo, you flick your wick, somebody says, look, it's your go-to on a move-head, and boom! You're off to the races. You can't even put this up. A smother it with a blanket? You could do that. That's for sure. Anybody else? Um... You can ask the crap like people for assistance? Get real, big kid! How about you, Missy? Get a fighting stilessure! Excellent, Miss Tompkins. But let's give the kids a chance. No, the classroom is there! Kids, come on! So it is! Everybody remain calm! By the way, what's on the other side of this wall? The chemistry line! That's what it's been accounted for. Our school, it's gone! When will they ever learn? Who wants marshmallows? Not when you're with Fire Marshall Bill, you don't? Let me show you something."

The first one's easy, but there's one way way around in the game and it's really hard. in comparison to this one. Let's grab that and that'll be it. So is that Star 100m? No, what am I saying?

Like that, like that right there I just collided with a purple one because of the fact that I crossed over in a direction where it would pop out. It really is a chance of blocking. This looks like a solid pattern to it. Which to be honest I didn't even look for when I was recording it. The first one's easy but there's a one way way around in the game and it's really hard. in comparison to this one. Let's grab that and that'll be it. So is that Star 100m? No, what am I saying? Star 44 I believe? I was supposed to say 144. That would mean that I would have been some of the Luigi stars already. God, I wish it was 144. Anyway, that's all for this video. Thanks for watching. I goodbye."

The unique Svitl Festival, which was returned from the Par Duba museum to Svitl, is waiting for another reconstruction. to return the original material to maximum possible size. And this, despite the fact, means also the movement of some parts and figures. In order to find out how the original Bethlehem really looked like, it was a meeting with the restaurateur of the mechanical Bethlehem, Kamil Andres, at the end of the Března city museum and gallery in Svitavá. Here, however, we were very interested in the professional, high professional level of behavior of the ball player, the figure, the great. The combination of various mechanical and mechanical materials is very similar to the ones in the bulls. We see a very similar process of the metal and the moving sheep, for example, from the similar process of the Freedlands. I think that this Bethlehem is really well-known for its great and high-quality conducting of polychromes and the art of art. It's really beautiful. It's a unique thing. The museum, together with the memorials, would have made the restaurant easier to work with, partly mechanically, with the reconstruction of its original look. There is a record of the visitors of the battle, when Mr. Metelka wanted to plant a toy machine in the battle and he wanted to take it from the trance to put it on the notes. He was also a mechanical battle machine and wanted to be a mechanical machine. He said yes, but he had to look at the top of the box. In the chronicle it was written that the notes had to be put on the notes. He didn't even give it to him. So they were very interesting. Even if they described themselves, they were inspired, but they did not like to be added to their mechanisms. We can find the mechanics of the battle with different movements. The figures can move in a straight line, they can move the ends, but there are also complex mechanisms that combine several movements into a group. For example, the rider leads the horse behind the horse, they go around and the rider turns around, in the Friedland Simon Bethlehem. So every artist tried to invent something new, better. It was very interesting and exciting. Among the participants of the Besed, there was also Mr. Ladislav Hubený, who had just started a new era of trying to return Bethlehem to the world. I feel great. Because I live with Bethlehem, For example, since 8 years ago. Since 8 years ago, when the barrel was in the front, it was bigger, but I could pay for it, that it is here. I have about 7 or 8 barrels at home, and now I do. You know what, it's nice to work with those barrels, because it is one of the most important How do you remember the battle? Have you ever found it? No, they had it on the street. They had it at home, they had it on the street. I was born there and they gave it to the rock, it just knows what it will do. Today you came here, write down, so you were interested in the fate of this cave and that you returned? Certainly, because we were shooting with a blank head, like a new director, so when the director returned, The museum was saved by the museum. When the museum was built in the district, all the former buildings were excavated. Fortunately, the museum was partially reconstructed. After the revolution, if the workers did not return the museum, they would be in the deposition. It took 20 years to change the view of the museum and the Parque d'Hubid. I hope that you will find the original beauty."

A anedade média, a realidade do protestantismo, começando na época do renascimento, ali na época da reforma, como foi a história da Igreja, tantas cenas diferentes, tantas situações difíceis que a Igreja enfrentou e hoje a Europa está enfrentando nova realidade também. A Europa, que foi o berço da reforma, enviou tantos missionários por todo mundo, levando essa mensagem nova, viva mais uma vez, trazendo esse retorno à leitura da palavra, essa busca de Deus mesmo, está vivendo agora um momento de crise. Como é que você viu isso ali na Inglaterra? e foi muito claro diante dos nossos olhos. Ao chegarmos em Inglaterra chegamos debaixo de muito frio. O frio era tão grande que os irmãos nos emprestaram dos seus agasalhos porque apesar de termos levado bastante agasalhos sabendo que estava era final do inverno lá, alguns lugares estavam... estavam vendo neve, não é? Estavam nevando. Apesar disso, nossos agasalhos não suportavam aquele frio tão grande intenso e nós vimos que este frio que nós sentimos na pele também estava na igreja. Muitas igrejas na Europa elas têm pessoas apenas com mais de 60 anos um grupo bem pequeno igrejas às vezes construídas para 500 mil pessoas estão reduzidas a 20 30 pessoas mais velhas e muitas igrejas fechando na Europa Susie e nós vimos assim que há algo que nós brasileiros precisamos tomar muito cuidado é exatamente como os nossos jovens estão na sua vida espiritual porque se o jovem está firmado nas escrituras se o jovem está buscando uma vida de santidade se o jovem tem comunhão com Deus nós vemos que mais de 80% dos avivamentos começaram com jovens jovens que oram jovens que levam a sério a palavra mas quando a igreja quer agradar tantos jovens e quer trazer os jovens de fora colocando na igreja atrativos do mundo, ou seja, fazendo uma programação igual a do mundo. Então isso aí já é um comecinho para o jovem distanciado da igreja. E nós vimos assim uma realidade na Europa que os europeus que nos deram essa chama de avivamento como Wesley, ou pessoal da reforma, né? John Huss ou Lutero, Tim de Wycliffe, essas pessoas assim que estavam buscando o Senhor de todo o coração, hoje nós vemos uma Europa desacreditada no evangelho, desacreditada na palavra de Deus, voltando mesmo às costas. Então é um desafio para a igreja, um desafio para os jovens e nós vemos que as igrejas na Europa hoje que são mais calientes, mais fortes, mais aquecidas são igrejas de latinos ou de africanos. Então brasileiros e latinos e também os africanos. Que lições que nós podemos tirar disso assim? Como é que a igreja pode aprender com os erros, né? Pra não cair nesses mesmos erros. Eu fiquei pensando enquanto você estava falando nas coisas que entraram por ventura dentro da igreja durante esse tempo. Talvez, a própria condição financeira, né? Sim. Pessoas começaram a ter o necessário e a ter a ganância de querer mais. E parece que a palavra de Deus fala que quando entra muito essa busca, né? Pela riqueza mesmo, a busca pelo Senhor fica em segundo plano, né? Exatamente. Eu vou dar um exemplo aqui, não da Europa, mas da Coreia do Sul. A Helena esteve na Coreia do Sul. Ela esteve lá numa igreja presbiteriana e tocou chofar-la na igreja. Foi muito lindo. E depois ela foi visitar a montanha de oração. Uma montanha onde as pessoas ficam ali um dia, dois dias, três dias. Há uma estrutura para as pessoas orarem. E a Helena foi para ficar uma semana. E ela conhecia alguns jovens nesta jornada dela. Quando ela estava ali, uma menina coreana, sul-coreana, disse pra ela, você vai ficar aqui uma semana? Ela disse sim. E a menina disse, fazendo o quê? Ela disse, ora, vou ficar orando. E ela perguntou, você está precisando tanto de orar assim? Ela disse, é claro, nós todos precisamos de orar. E a menina respondeu, ah, quem orava muito eram os nossos pais, nossos avós, porque eles eram muito pobres. A história de Paul Young-Shul, não é? Olha só! Cristo em nós, a esperança da glória. Eu fico pensando também em um outro fator que não foi essa questão do dinheiro, mas a questão dos filhos. Nós estamos há poucos dias de comemorar nem o dia das mães. Eu fico pensando realmente no ensino que estava sendo passado ou que não foi passado. Hoje em dia, parece que tanto os pais deixam tão na vontade a escolha dos filhos em ir à escola domicíaca ou não. Eu quero ir no clube hoje, então tudo bem, não precisa de ir. Eu fico pensando que se na igreja, a igreja tem muitas pessoas mais velhas, cadê os filhos? O que aconteceu? O que você acha que aconteceu nesse período de criação, de educação, que não manteve essas crianças no caminho do Senhor? Bem, houve um tempo na história da igreja, quando as pessoas seguiam a Deus pelo medo. A Igreja Católica Romana mesmo, pois muita questão do medo, então o período da Idade Média era o medo de ir pro inferno, tanto que a venda de indulgências. Olha, se você der dinheiro a pessoa vai sair, seu parente vai sair lá do inferno. Então era o medo. As pessoas tiveram acesso à palavra de Deus, à cultura, começaram a questionar, que viram que não é por aí. Mas aí elas passaram para um outro lado, é menosprezar a palavra de Deus. Falta de temor, né? Falta de temor de Deus. É algo que tem acontecido lá. E esta questão é tão importante de nós passarmos as verdades etenas para os nossos filhos. E quando eles são pequenos, eles devem ir à igreja, eles devem receber a palavra de uma maneira assim normal, mas também direcionada pelos pais. Não é? A criança não tem condição de escolher. De escolher, não sabe. Deus ou não, no sentido de não ter maturidade para falar, e você dessa igreja ou dessa, os pais vão levá-la, vão conduz-la. E quando os pais amam ao Senhor, lenha a palavra de Deus em casa, a palavra vai ficando incucada no coração das crianças. E isso é muito importante. E hoje a gente vê Suzy algo lá no Reino Unido, lá. em Londres. Nós vimos assim uma fachada muito linda. As casinhas são lindas. Parece casinha de chocolate. História de Joãozinho Maria. Aquela arquitetura inglesa. Eles gostam muito do Old Fashion, das coisas antigas. Eles não abrem mão do antigo. Mas nós vimos assim que as pessoas que vivem lá, elas vivem debaixo de pressões. Os brasileiros que estão lá Por exemplo, a vida é trabalhar. A vida é trabalhar. É tudo caro. Uma lugeu é muito caro. Possuir uma casa própria é muito caro. Então para isso eles vão se dando ao máximo ao trabalho, ao trabalho, ao trabalho. Não tem tempo para os filhos. As mães, o pai tem de trabalhar. A mãe tem de trabalhar. As crianças. aqui no Brasil também, né? As crianças relegadas a creche, relegadas a outros lugares e onde não vão receber o mesmo ensino, onde elas não vão ter estes princípios.","In Europe, the Church of Jesus Christ lives a different reality than what happened a few years ago. The Middle Ages, the Protestantism, the Renaissance, the Reform era, how the Church's history was, so many different scenes, so many difficult situations that the Church faced, and today Europe is facing a different new reality too. Europe, which was the cradle of reform, sent so many missionaries around the world, taking this new message, alive once again, bringing this return to reading the word, this search for God itself, is now living a crisis moment. How did you live this in England? And it was very clear in front of our eyes. When we arrived in England, we arrived under a lot of cold. The cold was so great that the brothers borrowed us from their gazelles. Because despite having taken a lot of gazelles, knowing that it was the end of the winter, some places were seeing snow, right? They were snowing. Despite that, our gazelles did not bear that cold. and we saw that this cold that we felt in the skin was also in the church. Many churches in Europe have people only over 60 years old, a very small group of churches, sometimes built for 500,000 people, are reduced to 20, 30 older people, many churches closing in Europe, Susie. And we saw that the people something that we Brazilians need to be very careful about is exactly how our young people are in their spiritual life because if the young people are signed in the scriptures if the young people are seeking a life of holiness if the young people have communion with God we will see that more than 80% of the dwellings started with young people young people who pray young people who take the word seriously but when The Church that was to please so many young people and bring them out, putting them in attractive Churchs of the world, that is, making a program that is just like the world. So this is a beginning for the young people to distance themselves from the Church. And we saw a reality in Europe that the Europeans that gave us this call for the revival, such as Wesley, or people of the reform, John Huss, Luther, or Tim Dei Weichliff, these people who were seeking the Lord of all hearts. Today we see an unreliable Europe in the Gospel, unreliable in the word of God, returning to the coasts. So it's a challenge for the Church, a challenge for the young people, and we see that the churches in Europe today and that are warmer, stronger, warmer, are Latin or African churches. Look at that. So, Brazilians and Latinos and also Africans. What lessons can we take from this? How can the church learn from the mistakes so as not to fall into these same mistakes? I was thinking while you were talking things that entered the people's venture during this time. Maybe, in the financial condition itself, people began to have the necessary and to gain more. And it seems that the word of God says that when this search comes in, by the wealth itself, the search for the Lord is in the background. Timi Nui, exactly. I will give an example that is not from Europe but from South Korea. Elena was in South Korea. She was there in a Presbyterian church. She played the chofar in the church. It was very beautiful. Then she went to visit the mountain of prayer. A mountain where people stay for a day, two days, three days. There is a structure for the people to pray. Elena went to stay for a week. She met some young people in her journey. When she was there, a Korean girl, a South Korean girl, said to her, you will stay here for a week? She said yes. And the girl said, doing what? She said, I will be crying. And she asked, are you needing so much to cry like this? She said, of course, we all need to cry. And the girl answered, ah, those who cried a lot were our parents, our grandparents, because they were very poor. The story of Paul Young-Shul, right? They were very poor, so they cried a lot. Look at that! Christ in us, the hope of glory. And I keep thinking about another factor that was not the matter of money, but the matter of children. We are, in a few days, of celebrating Mother's Day. And I keep thinking about the teaching that was being passed, or that was not passed. Nowadays it seems that both parents leave so much the will to choose their children, to go to the Dominican school or not. I want to go to the club today, so everything is fine, I don't need to go. And I keep thinking that if in the church, there are many older people, where are the children? What happened, what do you think happened in this period of creation, of education that did not keep these children on the way of the Lord? Well, there was a time in the history of the church when people, they followed God out of fear. The Catholic Church of Rome, even, because of the fear of the Middle Ages, was afraid of hell, so much so that the sale of indulgences. If you give money, the person will leave, and your relative will leave hell. So it was fear. People had access to the word of God, to culture, started to question, and saw that it was not because of that. But then they went to another side, to express the word of God. The lack of fear. The lack of fear of God. It is something that has happened there. And this issue is so important that we pass the eternal truths to our children. And when they are small, they must go to church, they must receive the word in a normal way, but also directed by their parents. Children have no choice. God or not, in the sense of... There is no maturity to say, if you give the church or this, parents will take it, they will lead it. And when parents love the Lord, read the word of God at home, the word is being inculcated in the heart of the children. And this is very important. And today we see Susie something in the kingdom of the United Kingdom. in London. We saw a very beautiful facade. The houses are beautiful. It looks like a chocolate house. It's a story of John Zimaria. That British architecture. They really like old fashion. Old things. They don't open their hands of the old. But we saw that the people who live there, they live under pressure. The Brazilians who are there, For example, life is to work. Life is to work. It's all expensive. A rent is very expensive. Having a house by itself is very expensive. So for that they go, giving their best to work, to work, to work, there is no time for the children. The mothers, the father has to work, the mother has to work, and the children. We are already seeing this here in Brazil, children are relegated to Cresce, relegated to other places, where they will not receive the same teaching, where they will not have these principles."

They established a civilization in Andalusia, a civilization in the region of Sqalya, a civilization in the region of Sham, a civilization spread in the land so that their religion would be based on this, based on knowledge. Jabir Ibn Hayyan was the one who became a chemist. He started by removing the chemical materials Some of them were different. Even the Muslims discovered more than 2,000 chemical substances. Who discovered the evidence, the news, and all the instruments of the test? Who are they? They are Muslims. The activities of the Qatir are their types. The Qatir of the Jaf, the Bukhari, the Haddam, and the Kharras. Who was using the Qatir? It is Jabir ibn Hayyan, and then Abu Bakr ibn Razi. Muslims are the most original Arabic knowledge of the chemical matter. Who invented the termometer to measure the temperature? Who? It's Benosina, the scientists who discovered the devices from the scale, measurement, information, and other materials used in the tests to this day. They were in medicine. So, the doctors became famous. They are Muslims. The Muslims came to the Prophet's house to discover the small bloodline after three years of the world's civilization. The Muslims came to the Prophet's house to study some of the natural sciences of man. The knowledge of the Jinn and the formation of the Jinn are all present in the Quran and in the Sunnah. The Muslims came to see their religion. They are taking the knowledge that is present and the proven ones are the ones who are the ones after them. They are surprised what is happening, they are right. And if some experiments that are free and the knowledge of the explanation and others, all of them are proven by the brain, it is not human. For example, the meat is formed and then the great animal is born. And in the Quran, the bones are made of meat. Muslims discovered that the great thing is to be formed first, then meat and this is not known except in the previous centuries. The Muslims in natural sciences, even philosophy, philosophy, logic, poetry, history, literature, Muslims, the whole world is witnessing their favor at this moment. The discoveries and the foundations used today in collections and the collection of books and collections, but today in Spain, the Muslims have witnessed the events of the Muslim civilization. In a collection, history has not been seen as an example. Muslims have taken everything, even the treasures, even the treasures, even the proud treasures, Who spread and spread it all over the world and founded the knowledge of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of the craft of They only spend the night and the night. Maybe in that time they only know the people who call themselves slaves, who take money from people and worship humans. What did you say about the time? Do you worship humans? And Muslims are aware of what human rights are called. What did you ask people? Their mothers were born to them. The Muslims were among the few who were standing in the back of the Muslim's house. They were wearing their clothes. with a falcon called Suckooka-Gufran They laughed at people and played with their religion until the French Revolution and the Revolutionary era came and Muslims in their civilization. Listen to this story. Britain ruled it as a man at that time called George II. He sent a book to the Wali of Andalusia. And the Andalusians were full of civilization. Who was the Muslim who was the Muslim who was the leader of the Andalusian streets? Muslims are the first to light a street light even the Babawat and the Qasawis in Europe say this is the act of the devils who make us day and night who is the light of night? they are Muslims who spread the evil in the streets? they are Muslims George II sent a message to his father Andalus called him Isham he said to him after he welcomed him and made a wish he said I will send you my brother's daughter They have 10 daughters, some of them are employees, they will sit in the Andalusian, they will learn from your universities and your knowledge and they will be in your influence to protect our country. They have a lot of ignorance from their 4 pillars. Before, Hisham, the father made them a private residence and gave them and paid them the money to study and learn. Italy, they send their sons to them. Europe, they send their sons to where? in Andalusia, hundreds of books and legends, Muslims who are full of books, reading, and studies, they spread knowledge all over the world after they have gained ignorance and injustice. Why? Because our religion orders this, because our religion does not deny the true knowledge, but calls to it and saves man if he does and discovers a discovery that makes humanity in any time."

I've gone ahead and turned off our Wi-Fi so we are now running only on 3G and I'm going to use an app called SpeedTest which runs on both iPhone and of course iPad.

It's asking me if we're using an Edge or 3G network and we have five bars of 3G so we're We're going to go ahead and select 3G. So it's testing network latency right now. And the test is already running on the iPad 3G. And we're just getting started on the iPhone. OK, the iPhone is finished. Now let's see what our results are. Looks like the iPhone and iPad have very similar download averages. We're averaging about 2,087 kilobits a second for the iPad and 2,098 for the iPhone. That's very close. There's a little difference on the upload speed. The average upload speed on the iPad is 268 and on the iPhone it's 103. Now latency is the big story here. Latency on the iPhone 3G is 1609 and it's only 139 on the iPad. Now what about Wi-Fi? Let's do a Wi-Fi test and see if the Wi-Fi antennas are any different between these two devices. Okay so we're back on Wi-Fi and I see that both have very strong signal strengths. They're at full three bars, whatever that means. go ahead and run that speed test again. This time we're using Wi-Fi. And this time, because we're sharing a Wi-Fi network, I'm gonna do one first and the other second. That way they're not robbing each other of bandwidth. So first I'm gonna do the iPad. And I'm gonna get the iPhone ready while that's going. This is about average for my ISP. I get about six down, or six megs down and about a meg up. And I have other devices running right now, so they're hogging some bandwidth. Now let's go ahead and test the iPhone. latency is also much higher on the iPhone once again at 300 milliseconds while the latency on the iPad was 48. Well there we have it. Not only is the iPad faster at 3G than the iPhone, it's also faster at Wi-Fi. In fact, the reception on the 3G is much better than the iPhone. I've carried this around everywhere. I've taken it to the places where my signal on the iPhone tends to drop off and be very poor. The iPad is much better. I can get full bars, full 5G, bars in the area where the iPhone only gets one.

One, if you can see there, of 6 cm, which will be the wider band and that will be rounding the head, and two bands of 5 cm that will go over the head and that will be crossed. Within these 5 cm crossed bands we will divide the band Now we have to draw the base of the base.

Hoje, no dia 14 de jude de 2014, 100 anos após o início da Primeira Guerra Mundial Recordaremos os principais patos que marcaram essa guerra Roda a matéria! A partir das terras da África e Ásia na segunda metade do século XIX, tirou muitos desentendimentos entre as nações europeias Enquanto em Glatérrim e França ficaram com grandes territórios com muitos recursos para explorar Alemanha e Itália tiveram que se contentar com poucos territórios de baixo valor formação de alianças e pactos de guerra. A questão do nacionalismo também se referente na Europa para a guerra. A península balcânica era uma região estratégica e muito conturbada, além de ser povoada por diferentes etnias, era foco de interesse entre o Império Russo e Austrungro, revolução industrial. Produziu uma acirrada disputante às potências industrializadas, causando diversos conflitos e o crescente espírito armamentista que culminou mais tarde na eclosão da Primeira Guerra Mundial. e as ações europeias fizeram vários acordos e alianças entre si. De tal modo que, em 1907, a Europa estava dividida em dois blocos militais antagônicos, a Triplice e a Aliança, formada por Alemanha, Itália e Imperostro-Hungaro, e a Triplice e a Intente, formada por Reino Unido, França e Rússia. No início da guerra, em 1914, a Europa conhecia um período de paz armada, onde as potências europeias lançaram-se em uma corrida armamentista desenfreada. Corrida armamentista é o processo pelo qual os países investem considerável parte de seus recursos na área militar, visando a preparação para a guerra e a intimidação das nações rivais. Em 28 de junho de 1914, Francisco Ferdinando, herdeando Trono, Austro-Ugaro, foi assassinado por um jovem nacionalista Apenas um mês depois do atentado, exércitos marchavam para tomar posições territórias adversárias. Essa guerra foi a primeira a envolver países de todos os continentes, apesar de grande parte de seus batalhos ter ocorrido na Europa. Durantes períodos, coincidindo com o Guenha de Movimento, a Leomão e Pretinho invadiram a França e a Bélgica porém não conseguiam avançar muito graças à resistência francesa. As trincheiras consistiam em canais cavados no solo, protegidos por arame farpado, sacos de terra ou areia, e chegavam a ter quilômetros de distenções, formado por vezes ligações entre os exércitos aliados. Dentro das trincheiras, centenas de milhares de soldados enfrentavam durante meses chuvas e inundações, lama, piolho, rato e doenças. Os exércitos em uma área de rato e em um lugar de rato e em um lugar de rato. que se imaginavam que essa guerra sem ação ia anirar um pouco, porém a Tade persistiu por 3 anos. para anotarizar a poderabilitar alemão e por fim a guerra. e com isso a Trips Alliance foi derrotada. não apagasse suas dívidas poderia ter o seu território invadido. Nesse mesmo ano foi criado a Liga das Nações, organizações internacionais responsáveis pela manutenção da liberdade e da paz entre os países.

From the lands of Africa and Asia, in the second half of the 19th century, many misunderstandings between European nations took place. While the French and Latin countries were with great territories with many resources to explore, the German and Italian had to settle with few territories with low value. the formation of alliances and war pact. The issue of nationalism is also present in Europe, it will go to war. The Balkan peninsula was a strategic and very contrived region, in addition to being populated by different ethnicities, it was the focus of interest between the Russian Empire and the Tungra, revolution of the sithya, produced a powerful and powerful attack of the industrialized powers, causing several conflicts and the growing armed spirit that culminated later in the inclusion of the First World War. and the forces of the enemy, the European actions made several agreements and alliances between them. In such a way that in 1907, Europe was divided into two military and antagonistic blocks, the Triples and the Alliance, formed by Germany, Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Triples and the Entente, formed by the United Kingdom, France and Russia. At the beginning of the war in 1914, Europe knew a period of Pazarmata, where the European powers launched themselves in a disemfrared Armamentist race. Armamentist race is the process by which countries and countries invest considerable part of their resources in the military area, aiming at the preparation for war and intimidation of the rival nations. On June 28, 1914, Francisco Ferdinando, Erdena Dutrono, and Austro-Ugaro were murdered by a young nationalist Only a month after the attack, armies marched to take positions in the enemy territory. This war was the first to involve the country and all continents, despite large parts of its battles having run in Europe. During this period, including the war of movement, the British invaded France and Belgium, but they were not able to launch much thanks to the French resistance. French, Germans and English improvised trenches to protect themselves and their territory. The trenches consisted of dug-up channels on the ground protected by sand and sand bags of land or sand and reached miles of distances formed by sometimes connections between the Allied armies. Within the trenches hundreds of thousands of soldiers faced during months rain floods, mud, dust, rats and diseases. They thought that this war was without action and it was little, but the tactic persisted for 3 years. The 19th century was signed by the Versailles, who knew the terms of the end of the First World War. The winners, led by France and England, considered Germany guilty of the conflict. Therefore, it should pay heavy indemnizations to the countries that had attacked. In the end, the Germans were defeated. that did not pay their debts could have their territory invaded. In this same year, the League of Nations was created. International organizations responsible for the maintenance of freedom and peace between countries. A very important factor at the end of the First World War was that women and children left their homes to work in arms industries. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

Главный врач отделения профессор доктор медицинских наук Райнар Шмельцаизен известен своими научными разработками по всей Европе. и мы проводим минимально инвазивным способом, при котором практически не остается шрамов. Кроме того, во время операции мы используем интероперативные навигационные системы, которые помогают хирургу полностью рассмотреть анатомические особенности пациента и просимулировать ход будущей операции. При таких операциях мы используем эндоскоп. Например, при операциях в области височного нижничелюстного состава раньше требовался очень большой разрез.

We've seen about a fourth of our deck. There's a post. Okay, so now we know what we're up against. This is probably a... Oh, a Moldrifter. Not good for us. I guess we'll just attack anyways and try to get him with an Echoing Decay. Or we could just... trade off our man now now we'd rather trade for the mold drifter discard outlet one time no alright get in there and rumble no blocks a at season seven we get a hard cast a grave scrabler yeah that might actually be our best option at this point because we want to force him to have to do something you know not the best play Like when we built the deck we didn't build it to be just hard casting grave scrabblers, but We don't want to just sit here and die either and we do have five power now So I mean if he comes up empty we could definitely just get in there and get him Hey, we traded our scrabbler for his flame slash. That's pretty hot And our stink lead him Okay So I guess his plan is just to race us with his little dudes. That's not really gonna work That's not good. Um, cycle this man I guess. And go get a swamp. We will draw a tortured existence. Oh I could, I could choose to draw a stinkweed instead. That's okay. Shittering rat. Alright. Uhhh, yeah. Pretty sure we're just dead to the Muldrifters since he got our Echoing Decay within the gate. Cause that's a real card. Yep. Troops Muldrifters. So that was kind of lame. So he had kind of like a creature based version of this deck. I still think, I don't know, my plan of Augur of Skulls maybe is not so good against the creature based decks. I don't think I want echoing decay. I definitely don't want fume spitter. stinkweed imp. I don't think we need all of those and we're going to be siding in additional dredger anyhow so I guess we'll give this a shot."

E se o han planteado en el ámbito de un plan que han elaborado há cinco años para de alguna manera potenciar la cofradía con iniciativas como esta e outras de mejora do patrimonio de carácter litúrgico. É unha cofradía moi volcada na relación con el culto de Antela Eucaristía. A parte de Iba, o Corpus Cristi, fin, hai un planteamiento ambicioso en ese sentido que esperan poder llevar a cabo, lógicamente. Na cofradía relativamente nueva se funden 1946.","We are talking about the exit of the institution. This is one of the cofferdas that has a costal. I have seen it go out this afternoon. There is a silent sepulchre until the moment when the passage can go out of the parish of the perpetuos Ocorro, in this case of Zaragoza. It's from the Eucharist. The Eucharist sacred cathedral. It's confused by the colours. These are very significant, representative colours. The Vatican colours, the white and yellow. It's like the colour yellow of bread. It's the last of the Eucharist that will be held tonight at the church of San Cayetano. I'm seeing the standard that the way they put the caliph is the copy of the Holy Caliph of the cathedral. but that everything is ex-Santo Calid on the land of Saragoza, according to the tradition, and more specifically, it happened when the peña, the jefería, and according to the data we know, at the end of the 14th century, to this city of Saragoza. We still know the details of this Euucharistia's infirmary. Before, let's see how they have come from the coming of Cesar Augusto in that procession of the column. Here, Correiza is with some of the coffers. It has been more than four hours of processing. We are with Casios, one of them. Good evening. Good evening. We say more than four hours. How have you been? Well, four and a half hours. Well, a little like every year. It's our big day. It's our regular process. So, well, like every year, with an illusion. And tired. Even very tired. How many years have you been in this day? Well, when I'm 39, I play. 39 years? Yes, 39. That's almost half a life. More than half. In my case, more than half. I hope I have someone else. but at the moment 39. How do you feel being a member of a coffradia and participating? Because this is all year long, not only during the Holy Week. We try to be there all year long, so of course these are our big days, but we also do it all year long, we try to do it almost every month, with a trip, for donations, for the pillar, flowers, rosary, Christmas, to cover a little all year and apart we have a floor, we also do not put together all week. It is the most numerous coffradia that there is in Zaragoza, What is your most attractive position? Well, attractive, no one, because when I entered I was the smallest, it's hard to work it and go up. Now we are 1,300 and I think we are the ones who burn the most. I think it's the one who burns the most. The stadium is still not known, but it's hard to work a little and people are getting together. I want to take care of the difficult, but thank you very much for attending us, I imagine that you will rest a little. Thank you very much, Quico. We saw the face of the chest of He was obviously excited and spoke to the ship of the emblem that we are seeing in the arm of this other brother of the Eucharist, that Saint Caliph, whose step could be, they say, by our community. but then we see those sassas and perhaps in some drink we can see in the habits of these coffers are the very posterior sediments, very late, they are beautiful, beautiful and full of beauty. We are in front of a coffer shop that has several singularities, one, they are seeing it right now in the director, they are costalers, only three steps in Zaragoza, which are carried by costalers in the civilian style, in the style of Andaluz, they are costalers who have several hours, quite hours under this and he has a lot of weight on his shoulders and neck. And another one, which has a music band. It's one of the singularities of a very special band. It's about the case of the humble Jesus of the band, the other coffradier, who has the steps that he takes with the costalers, the Sevillian style. It's a sign of the demand between the two coffradiers. We'll say that they've borrowed a little bit from Comillas the band to accompany the costalers of the Christian Amorfradi. This is the Christ of brotherly love, a work by an image-maker of Antonio Labania. It is not written in the Holy Land, when the impression comes out today, making a crossway with the known path as the solitude of the cross. In fact, this crossway was made on Tuesday with a Christ who is there at the cult in the Baroque del Perpetuoso Corro. This one also incorporates a very interesting initiative, which is a music and the choral music that they expect to be potential in the coming years with some instruments, let's say, of ancient music. It is an initiative to recover something that perhaps is the tradition of the Holy Week, but that Zaragoza practically had lost. And then it has other peculiarities in effect, as mentioned in the theme of the costalers, it was dared in his day to take the initiative of the artist Colomor Frater, the costal, and well, even to have the 2012-day project of the passing of the dinner, which also came out by costalers, for which they are making a The name of the place is the one that is very interesting to live this experience. It is an impressive experience to take a step to the coast so that you can get in touch with the body of the day. It is 2.05 am and these coastmen take this step from 9 pm to the parish of our lady of the Perpetus, in the avenue of Goya. The coastmen who are located on the four corners are known as patiros. The turn is in the moment when the pass has to turn. On its side are the fixers, which consist of the function of helping the constable and in the center is curious to be those who call the currents. They say that it is the most damaged position of all because they have no contact with the exterior. Of course, taking a step with the constable, I think it is absolutely difficult and complicated because This step is still light within what we know, but if this piece is really worth it, it's worth it. A mystery step with several figures. With the two apostles. The step of the dinner. The dinner, of course. It's a challenge. They have set it up in the field of a plan that has been working for five years to somehow enhance the piece with initiatives like this and others to improve the pattern of the liturgical character. It's a very bold piece in relation to the cultural and the Eucharist. and the body of Christ. Finally, there is an ambitious plan in that sense that they hope to be able to carry out logically. A relatively new day was founded in 1946."

So I haven't played the game, but I have seen video on YouTube for gameplay and the features and news and other and this game is nowhere close to disappointment for the most part. This game is nothing short of an amazing WWE game, wrestling game if you're a fan of the WWE and a fan of wrestling. The game is coming out on Tuesday, which is hit stores in the United States 24 plus hours from now But the game officially comes out in less than 24 hours. That's right in less than 24 hours the game will be Officially out Because it will be Tuesday, but not officially in the stores. It will be a little bit longer than 24 hours before the games are actually in the store so I think the game is amazing there are some There are some areas of the game that need improvement still and have a lack of but there are a lot of parts in the game such as the Royal Rumble that are very very much improved this year. For example you have three ways of eliminating your opponent in addition to the normal way by tossing your opponent opponent over the top rope as you would in previous games and both feet touch the floor. You can throw your opponent into the turnbuckle and throw him over the turnbuckle to eliminate him. Also you can eliminate your opponent by pushing him under the ropes with your foot but only after Another new feature, another new positive note in the game is Korean content a new a new and improved create a superstar with all new parts created parts the relief parts and Your character is gonna look amazing plus They went from 30 to 50 created super star slots so instead of creating 30 superstars you create 50 superstars You can share your creative content in addition to your creative superstar online such as the creative story Obviously the great superstar and the highlight reel and a few more things. You're surprises I'm not gonna touch upon right now In addition to those features and gameplay improvements another game play improvement is The reversal was two buttons for grapple and strikes. This year grapple and strikes have been toned down to one reversal button and now it would be LT which used to be the striking reversal button. Striking and grappling reversing this year has been completely modified and and will be all about skill and timing. Something new to the game that is a pretty decent new feature is SuperShark Threads. You can change the color of Super Star Wars that are already in the game, you can change their entire color. Although for the Undertaker you cannot change the logo on his type. But unfortunately, that is the only thing he ever changes and you cannot change that. Also, the downside is when you're creating a story and you want to upload it, if you're using your created super story, you can only use your created super story 10 times in a story. Because when the user is uploading your story, the creator's super story Superstar is included in that and there's some kind of issue with that But I'm not gonna give you today. Also a minor disappointment is uploading superstars crazy superstars is Not all that great because If you upload a superstar a crazy superstar you cannot edit or change anything about it only use him online or off offline the way it was uploaded or downloaded. I will have a part 2 coming soon before the release of the game so I hope you enjoy it. This was your WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 review part 1. Thank you for watching.",

Pero también en esos mismos periodos que se están analizando, en el cuarto trimestre del 2000 eran las mujeres del 34%, representaban el 34% de la población ocupada y ahora es el 38%. Es decir, hubo un crecimiento muy importante el número de mujeres desocupadas del 2000 al 2009. Entonces, ese es un buen dato, es un dato positivo, seguramente insuficiente, pero es un dato importante. Las mujeres se han estado ganando los espacios a fuerza de un permanente esfuerzo de integración, de vinculación laboral. Yo como conocedor de la materia del trabajo del mundo laboral, tienen que estar cambiando la cachucha cada 3, 4, 6, 8 horas para atender las diferentes responsabilidades que ellas tienen. Entonces, yo, por eso valoro tanto a ese esfuerzo que están haciendo las mujeres y que si vemos que han ido creciendo en su participación, en la economía, en el mundo del trabajo, no ha sido gratuito, más bien ha sido a contrapelo, a contracorriente, pero van ganando, van ganando espacios, y eso genera un inicio cultural, porque va permeando en su círculo de amigas, su círculo de amistades y familiares van viendo, fíjate que Fulaniita es ama de casa, trabaja, atiende estas actividades y eso genera buenos ejemplos, entonces dicen, bueno, si Fulaniita puede, porque yo no voy a poder, y entonces se genera una acción social muy interesante mejorar el marco laboral de nuestro país para que la inserción laboral de las mujeres sea más justa, más fácil y más productiva. las mujeres embarazadas para que pudieran tener una estancia mayor de tiempo para con sus bebés. Pero aparte de eso, él evitó pedirle pruebas de embarazo a las mujeres que quisieran trabajar en su gobierno. Entonces, esas son cosas puntuales que van abriendo obrecha y que le van permitiendo a la sociedad tener un conocimiento de que hay políticos y hay políticas que le permiten una integración más fácil a las mujeres. Como ese ejemplo, habría que repetirlos en toda la República Mexicana, porque si hay diferencias, hay que ayudarlas a disminuirlas.","Women in the economic context and more particularly in the labor area have increased their presence. Perhaps not with the speed and depth that we all wish, but if there has been an increase, I can tell you that for example, for the fourth quarter of the 2000 with data from INEGI, the economically active population was 30%. and for the fourth quarter of 2009, it already increased 3 points, that is, 38%. But also in those same periods that are being analyzed, in the fourth quarter of 2000, women represented 34% of the population occupied, and now it's 38%. That is, there was a very important growth, the population of the country is 4% and the participation rate is also an increase in women and there is a decrease in the population of the population of the population. In the fourth quarter of 2000 there were 52% of women unemployed and today it is 47%. I have studied the number of women unemployed from 2000 to 2009. So that is a good data, it is a positive data, surely insufficient, but it is an important data. Women have been gaining space by the strength of a permanent effort of integration, of labor link. As a knowledge of the matter of labor work, I respect women, first because we were all separated by a woman, but additionally because there are really plausible examples of many women who today have two or three very priority functions in the Michoacan society and in the Mexican society. They are housewives, they are family bosses, they are workers and they are They have to be changing the cash flow every 3, 4, 6, 8 hours to attend the different responsibilities they already have. So, that's why I value this effort women are making. And that if we see that they have been growing in their participation in the economy, in the world of work, it has not been free, rather it has been against hair, against electricity, but they are gaining space And that generates a cultural beginning. Because it permeates their circle of friends and family. They see that Fulani is a housewife, she works, she attends these activities. And that generates good examples. They say that if Fulani can, because I can't, then it generates a very interesting social action. I encourage many women to gain space to empower themselves from the world of work, to empower themselves from the civic world and also from politics. My secretary of work, Javier Lozano, is making an effort to manage information with federal legislators of all parties so that, once and for all, we can modify the federal law of work in many issues. But one that you ask me now is how we achieve to improve the labor market of our country so that the labor insertion of women is fairer, easier and more productive. Here it is worth remembering the good things. The former governor of Michoacán, Don Lázaro Cardenas Batel, pointed out as a public public policy of his administration that would give women more time to work to have a longer distance with their babies. But apart from that, he avoided asking for pregnancy proofs to women who wanted to work in his government. These are key things that open up a gap and allow society to have a knowledge of politics and politics that allow women to have a more easy integration. As an example, we should repeat them throughout the Mexican Republic, because there are differences and we have to help them to decrease them."

Give it a little whip up. Some people like to whip it well. Some people like to just sort of break it up so you kind of get it. get little kind of streaks of lovely kind of red yolks and sort of the whites as well. Let's talk about flavour. Now like an omelette, like a pizza, like risotto, you can do any flavour you want. I'm just going to smash up peas and broad beans to make like a kind of pesto, sort of pisto. Call it a pisto, pisto, broad bean stow, don't work. I'm going to put a little pinch of salt in there and I'm just going to smash that up. I want to get some mint into the story. This is going to be super super tasty. You see I'm just lightly smashing up the peas. Lemon zest has to be in there. Some lemon juice just to set off the flavours to me. Damn right. Delicious. Half a lemon goes straight in there. You want to add about two tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil. So I'm just going to take a little bit of parmesan. Put a bit of sort of salty fatness in there. Yum. Happy with that. I've got my asparagus tips here. I'll just cut them in half. oil into the pan. Often I use a little knob of butter but I haven't got any so not today. I'm just going to fry those asparagus for a second. The eggs here, what I'm going to do is put a little spoon into my mix like that just to kind of get that whipped into it. Look how it kind of, it just turns the eggs a kind of nice sort of green colour which is kind of, I like. Go straight in with the eggs, get it all out and then going to go in with a little blobs of my beautiful peas and just for like 35 seconds while the frittata is starting to set you know just sort of put these bombs in you can see the eggs starting to firm up but this is the great kind of thing you come home start it finish it 10 minutes. See how it's almost cooking like an omelet when you kind of see those little sheets that does give it a sort of cute little internal sort of texture which is nice. I'm going to go around the edge just a little bit of feta and a little bit of Parmesan and that will cook a treat. I'm going to put it into the top of the oven. It's quite nice to get a bit of colour. You know, you can under cook it and have it, well, you can just cook it, but really most retards that I've eaten around Italy and I've had a lot, I kind of cook through. Whack it in the oven, cook it until it's kind of cooked through and a little bit golden on top. While that's cooking, I'm going to put a really simple basic salad together with some pea shoots, some rocket, raw peas, which I love. salad you can nick a few tomatoes if you want beautiful. The other half of the lemon, little seasoning, little olive oil, very nice very simple little salad come with me you can see if you have a look in there see how the frittata has doubled in size let's take that out have a little look at it turn the oven off look at that but just get in there and just push it out like that have fun with it there you go my friends That is a beautiful frittata super quick.

Today we're going to cover how to create a narrow style bass and massive. So as you can hear it's just this really grimy bass sound. So we'll go ahead and pull up a blank massive patch and we'll start with our oscillators. For oscillator 1 we'll detune it slightly and set it to a saw 1 waveform. For oscillator 2 we'll detune it in the opposite direction and then leave it set to a square wave form. Go ahead and max out your amp. For oscillator 3 we'll set it to form it and then choose a chrome wave form. We can go ahead and set our wavetable position to about 2 o'clock and max out our amp as well. Now go ahead and route your oscillators to filter 1. What we'll do is we'll choose a band reject filter. Go up on our cutoff as well as our resonance and bandwidth. You can set those to about 12 o'clock. We'll set our filtering the series. Now scroll back to your modulation oscillator, activate the phase of OS2 and go up on that a touch. So we're starting to get there. Now we can take LFO 5 and route it to the cutoff of our filter. We'll sync up our rate, set it to a ratio of 4 to 1. Now for our envelope we want to max out our decay level. We can be it up with a parabolic shaper, just a touch of drive, and then scroll up to your effects and EQ section. We'll boost our low shelf slightly, max out our frequency, and as you can hear that's just a really nasty sound. So lastly we'll beef it up with a touch of tube saturation.

Het doel van de stichting is het mogelijk maken dat mensen in Kenia over schoon drinkwater kunnen beschikken. Dit kan onder andere bereikt worden door het plaatsen van waterpompen.         Eind 2008 hoorde Roland van Goudoever over een Nederlandse stichting (Stichting Ukunda Schools Project) die verschillende scholen ondersteunt in Kenia. Hij werd geraakt door dit verhaal en in februari 2009 ging Roland zelf poolshoogte nemen. ""Ik wist niet wat ik zag. Er is daar zoveel nodig van wat wij zo normaal vinden. Zoals schoon drinkwater. In Ukunda bijvoorbeeld moeten de mensen een flink eind lopen om aan water te komen. En dat is dan ook niet gezuiverd, met alle gevolgen van dien.""         Zelf is Roland loodgieter van beroep en is veelvoudig aan de slag in het WTC te Amsterdam. Het was voor hem vanzelfsprekend dat hij zich in zijn vrije tijd moet gaan inzetten voor meer schoon drinkwater. Vandaar de stichting First Water.       ENGLISH:      Firstwater Foundation was founded by Roland van Goudoever. The Foundation's objective is to enable people in Kenya to have clean drinking water. One way to achieve this is by installing water pumps.       At the end of 2008, Roland van Goudoever discovered Foundation Ukunda Schools Project (SUSP), a Dutch foundation that supports various schools in Kenya. He was touched by this project and in February 2009, Roland went to Kenya to see things with his own eyes.""I couldn't believe my eyes. They are lacking so much that we take for granted, such as drinking water. For example, in Ukunda, people have to walk a considerable distance to get water, and it isn't even purified. This has obvious consequences.     Roland works as a plumber at the WTC in Amsterdam. It was obvious to him that he had to devote his free time to more, clean drinking water.

Więcej informacji znajdziecie na naszej stronie internetowej: http://www.t-mobile-trendy.pl/artykul,353,samsung_monte_s5620_-_mocarny_maluch,testy,1.html","S5620, Monte, TMobile, Samsung",11894,50,10,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/aZeo-ZXlBS8.mp3,"Namiazdka smartfona w ciele komórki. Takie skojarzenie wywołuje w nas Samsung Monte S5620. Ten niezwykle wszechstronny telefon powinien sprawdzić się zarówno w dłoni nastolatka, jak i biznesmena. Samsung Monte S5620 nie jest przesadnie ciężki, waży raptem 92 gramy i pewnie trzyma się w dłoni. Od pierwszych chwil mamy wrażenie obcowania z urządzeniem o szerokiej palecie zastosowań. Liczba przecisków na obudowie została ograniczona do niezbędnego minimum. Prócz regulacji głośności znajdziemy tu również szybką blokadę telefonu, uruchamiania aparatu cyfrowego, a także przyciski sterujące pod ekranem dotykowym. Sam ekran wykonany w technologii zmiany pojemności elektrycznej reaguje szybko i precyzyjnie na lekkie dotknięcie palcem. Dużym plusem jest wyprowadzenie gniazda dla karty pamięci na zewnątrz. Dzięki temu nie ma potrzeby rozdabieszania telefonu. Do zalet należy zaliczyć również obecność tradycyjnego gniazda słuchawkowego. Pierwszą oznaką tego, Jako to, że mamy do czynienia z czymś więcej niż tradycyjnym telefonem komórkowym, jest możliwość skorzystania z kilku pulpitów. Przewijamy je na boki, podobnie jak chociażby w iPhoneie. Daje to naprawdę sporo miejsca na umieszczenie wielu aplikacji. W każdej chwili mamy też dostęp do podstawowych funkcji na dole ekranu. Samsung Monte S5620 korzysta z widgetów, czyli miniaturowych programów, które możemy uruchamiać bezpośrednio z pulpitu. Wystarczy przeciągnąć jest biblioteki na dole ekranu. Jak przystało na nowoczesny telefon Samsung Monte S5620 zapewnia dostęp do najpopularniejszych usług internetowych oraz społeczności. funkcja aparatu cyfrowego o rozdzielczości 3,2 megapiksela. Ilość dostępnych ustawie nie jest więcej niż przeciętna. Wybór różnych trybów fotografowania scenerii, a do tego regulacja balastu bieli czy samowyzwalacz. To właśnie czyni Samsunga Monte S5620 urządzenie warte swoje i stosunkowo niewygórowanej ceny. Radio FM, system MRDS, dyktafon od twarzać multimedialny, prosty edytor zdjęć, a nawet funkcja rozpoznawania muzyki. Chyba nikt z nas nie ma już wątpliwości, że mamy do czynienia z telefonem w pełni multimedialnym Samsung Monte S5620 to telefon przygotowany do pracy w różnych warunkach sprawdzi się jako aparat dla nastoletniego internauty jak i początkującego biznesmena, którego przytłacza natłok codziennych obowiązków.","Smartphone socket in the cell phone. This is the connection that we have in Samsung S5620. This unusual, all-round phone should be checked both in the hands of a teenager and a businessman. Samsung S5620 is not too heavy, weighs a rap-92 grams and probably holds in the hands. For the first time we have the impression of removing the device with a wide palette of applications. The number of buttons on the build has been limited to an unnecessary minimum. In addition to volume control, we can also find a quick phone block, digital device, and also buttons that control the touch screen. The screen itself, made in technology, changes the electrical capacity and reacts quickly and precisely to a light touch with the finger. A big advantage is the introduction of a socket for memory cards outside. Thanks to this, there is no need to disassemble the phone. The advantage is also to count the presence of the traditional headphones socket. We have to do something more than a traditional wireless phone. There is an opportunity to use a few pulpit. We pass them aside, just like in the iPhone. It gives a lot of space for many applications. At the moment, we also have access to basic functions at the bottom of the screen. Samsung Montes S5620 uses widgets, i.e. miniature programs that we can start without a direct from the pulpit. It is enough to drag the library down the screen. We want to resign from them, we pull them with the return of the lower bell. Of course, all the time we can take new widgets from the network. As a result of the modern phone, Samsung Montes S5620 provides access to the most popular Internet services and social media. MySpace, Facebook, Gmail. These are only some of the examples in the built applications. Due to the presence of the GPS module, there is also a navigation program and the possibility of using the built-in Google Maps. It is worth stopping for a moment at the function of the app. The camera has a digital resolution of 3.2 megapixels. The amount of available settings is more than average. The choice of different modes of photography is the scenario, and the white or the self-reliant setting is the one. This is what Samsung Montes S5620 is made of. The device is worth its relatively low price. Radio FM, the RDS system, the Digtaphon from the multimedia app, the simple photo editor, and even the function of recognizing music. I think none of us is already convinced that we have the ability to do Samsung Monte S5620 is a phone ready for work in various conditions. It is a device for the old internet, as well as a beginner businessman who is in charge of daily duties."

Το 1982 που υπήρξε το άσσυλο από τον επανούσιο των Ακαδημαϊκών ήταν μια περίοδος μετά τη δικτατορία και προφανώς υπήρχαν κάποια σαναγγειότητας έκρηξης που υπήρχε στην Παναιμπιστημιακή Εκηνότα.

Yes, look at the event. At the beginning, it was due to the lack of scientific knowledge. And not only today, but many years ago, in 1982, when the knowledge was acquired by the academician, it was a period after the dictatorship, and apparently, there were some disadvantages, the lack of scientific knowledge and the lack of community. Today, at this moment, and even since 2007, which unfortunately I see the path of the news, and I see that all the ministers of the new democracy are writing it down and I was wondering why the ministers of the new democracy are writing it down, this is the need that they see today, they haven't seen it before. Today we have the democracy here but we are also forced to say that there are no additional ideas. There are no additional ideas, there is always one. On the contrary, the university is the only place that doesn't have any additional ideas. For what reason? Because there are very nice theoretical discussions, but I hope that Mr. Pritan here will make me a safe place I am a volunteer and I am a volunteer. Do you believe that I can pass the University's curriculum that I have done, which is successful, educational and educational? I cannot predict it. And you know it very well, Mr. Hansen-Kolaou. I have also done it, Mr. Rodoulis. I come here, at the second point. At this point, the groups of the left-wing groups, the university is really being destroyed, I specifically mention you in the public, in the public, in ASOE, you do not belong to the public, and the organization of our party to lower the elections did not allow it. The voters are talking about the movement of God. And we will bring two characteristic examples that show the brutality, because I want to hide the British origin and the government. I tell you, two circumstances. We have, and we say, seven firsts of 2011. My question is about the violent situation in which there are the pros and cons. Mr. Papoutsis, I answer. The same day, Mr. Panaretos, Mr. Christopoulos, answered Mr. Adonis Georgiani for the same issue. The Pesodromos Patriarch, Greek-Greek Pemdu, between his central building and the building of the Athens Academy, where many people can be seen, does not belong to the Pemdu School. That is, the government, on the same day, the Minister of Public Health says we cannot intervene, but we must do it. and the Minister of Education tells us that there is no such thing. ASOE. I will say two examples and I will say what Mr. Christopoulos told us. In the good news of ASOE, we were asked that in the University of Panepistimios, these days, there are many opportunities for the environment. And the Minister tells us, especially in the Eid of the New Year, ASOE has not been forced to go on the road and in the University of Panepistimios, the products are not available. Mr. Papoutsis, the Minister of Education, is answering us about the incident where ASOE took the country. that the Ministry of Justice was designed by the Ministry of Justice to conduct a climate change to control the industry. In the past ten hours, the Ministry of Justice was elected to the Parliament, without saying the words of the representatives of the judges and the judges, as they came to the university. They were then expelled by a hundred people, with their characteristics, and after they were expelled, they were accused of anti-intimidation. of the climate crisis, where two of the police were injured and five of the soldiers were killed. This is the message of the ASSOE. To send the other party's message from the ASSOE, to tell us, the President of ASSOE, that it will not be possible in ASSOE, and to take the initiative through ASSOE, the climate of the police. And we ask, in a 2010 democracy, which is now under the Assoe Act, in two places, I say, and it is also a member of the ASSOE, We have a small and well-known character and we have this great character. We need the help of the Greek authorities, but everyone has been helped by the asylum. We are not expressing any disappointment. Let's go to a small break. We will return with Mrs. Christophilopoulou and Mr. Sofianos in two minutes again."

Stay happy, just you. 35 minutes on a regular day. We saw that it was a regular day, we saw that it was a different interview. The physical preparator, the sports trainer, entrusted us with the following thing. He was a man who was used to triathlon, so he was a non-compliant sport. He went up with the Malphaget and he told us, well, I, a non-compliant sport, I had the impression of doing a marathon in 20 minutes. So much, it was so physically exhausting, I said to myself that something was going to eat and burn. So it's true that in any case, I had, in what concerns me, the huge chance of doing a good job. with the France's patreons a few days ago and I can tell you that it was both sublime, beautiful but quite physical that the historian told you earlier when you make the sherry virages for example and they go on for 20 minutes non stop just one sherry virage and you represent a 6 or 7G that is to say that you weigh 6 or 7 times your weight and that therefore"

Die 25 man wordt verhaald over de auto's. Dat iedereen ook even voet aan het krijgt daarvoor. We moeten ons blokzaten en dat we het even tegenaan vertellen over hoe dit allemaal in elkaar gezet is. En over het hele bomencentrum. Ik denk dat dit wel zo'n beetje is. Ik wens jullie allemaal een hele leuke dag. Ik hoop dat ik iedereen nog een beetje nog streekend vandaan. Hopen dat we wel een tijdje hebben. Ja? maar ze zijn nog niet geleefd he denk ik. En nou jullie zijn hier zo allemaal langs mere dankzij oude van Ambo. Dus ik denk wel dat het positief is. Dus kan je hier nooit binnenkomen. Dit is het groene panforium wat uitsluitend gebruikt wordt voor zakelijke activiteiten. Elke dag is hier een bedrijf uit Nederland die hier een vergaandering, een sessie, een presentatie, een ongres houden. Er zijn ongeveer 28.000 mensen per jaar in het groene parfouillon. Zoals de Shell, Microsoft, Banken, Nike, Philips. Alle handbedrijven komen hier en blijven hier een dag of drie dag delen. En doen wat ze moeten doen. En waarom komen ze nou hier waarschijnlijk? Omdat ze dit een leuke plek vinden. Omdat die mooi centraal in het land ligt. De resultaten van een bijeenkomst, hier wat hoger zijn, vindt men dan in een zaaltje van van het valen. Die grijze zaaltjes, dat is niet helemaal zo hiervan heen om resultaten te scoren als je een training, een presentatie of een prijsuitleiding hebt. En veel vinden dus de weg hier naartoe. Elk jaar zo'n 260 bedrijven uit Nederland, dus 260 dagen is dit gevuld. En je kunt je dus alleen maar komen op uitnodiging van. Het is nooit anders geovend dan dat je wordt uitgenodigd door iemand. En dit geval is een gelukkig, meer eens een autogezelschap. Allemaal mensen die een relatie hebben met de auto en zowaar met een mooi melk, Volvo en zowaar of met een mooi type, de 4-tachtig. Nou, we hebben hier nog zo'n 13 verschillende Volvo De eerste was de 850 TR, die hadden geloof ik een jaar of zeven geleden, hun tien jaar op bestaan. Het was heel bijzonder voor die laden, want er stonden 64 gele T5R hier op de parking. Nou, dat gebeurde hun eigenlijk nooit. Meestal altijd de vijf of zes op teams, maar hier waren er 64 stations en horen. En die stonden hier op de parking in een paar zwart en een paar rooien. Maar vergen niet mooi. Dat was bijzonder. Maar zo is de 1800e heerste club hier geweest. Over een medical 4 dan is het 25 jaar gestaan van de Kattenrug Club. Die komen hier met 100 man. En zo zijn alle registrers, 240, het 7000 registreers, 260 club, die zijn hier geweest. En dan maak ik soms ook nog wel eens een uitzondering om ook nog het museum te bezoeken. Maar nu zou ik dat doen of niet?","We are working with a group of 25 men. 25 men are told about the cars. That everyone gets a lot of attention. Our group is telling about how this all happened together. About the whole tree center. I think this is a bit of a thing. I hope you all have a very nice day. I hope that everyone will be a little bit more relaxed today. But I hope we have time. Yes? I hope that we can give the conversation to the people. Yes, that's nice, right? Good. I'll stand there. Well, welcome all here in the green park for you. Who was the manager? Hey, who are we in the project? In the museum. And where can you come back? I think you're in the package. Oh, you're in the package? Oh. You are all here thanks to the owner of Ambo. So you can never enter here. This is the green pantheon which is used for business activities. Every day a company from Megalod is here. They hold a meeting, a session, a presentation, a congress. 28,000 people per year are here in the green pavilion. Like Shell, Microsoft, Bank, Nike, Philips, all hand companies come here and stay here for a day or three days and do what they have to do. And why are they coming here? Probably because they find this a nice place, because it is a nice central in the countryside. And because the results of a income are higher here, I think, than in a little bit of the fall. Those grey little things are not completely here to score results, if you have a training, a presentation or a prize selection. And many people find the way here. Every year about 260 companies from the Netherlands, so 260 days, this is full. You can only get a request from someone else. It is never different than being invited by someone else. In this case, it is a happy thing to have a car company. All people who have a relationship with the car and so on with the beautiful milk Volvo and so on with a nice guy, the 4-touch. The first was the 850 TR, the T5R, which was there about 10 years ago. It was very special for the Lauer, because there were 64 yellow T5Rs in the parking lot. Well, that never happened to them. Mostly there were 5 or 6 teams, but here were 64 stations and hones. They were in the parking lot in the Parooje, but they were not very good. But now we should do it or not?"

I hope I'm not talking too much probably. I'm sorry I didn't show you what I just did. Today was a long, long, long day. But I just think this is so much easier to do is curling it while it's not near your hair. It's just easier. Instead of pulling the hair like this in the extension clip, maybe slipping or pulling hair. I mean you can do it but sometimes if you're in a rush and it's just not as convenient as while your hair is laying there and you can just curl it really quick while you're doing your makeup or whatever you do before you do your hair. I'm gonna just clip again, run my fingers through a section of this hair right here. Snaps home really loud. Looks like a little pulled out there. In my hole. Scary. Cute now for my final track I have three tracks in so far Sometimes I just take the middle nice e-word doesn't look so heavy, and I just take the top like this From like I don't know maybe an inch away from where you put your last extensions This is like a bigger track the other ones were pretty small I should have showed that in the beginning sorry And this one I'll do individually as well There's not there's not certain way you like helpful The more space you give it between the curls, the bigger the curl. Even if you're using, let's say, 3 fourths curling iron, one inch, one and a quarter, the more hair you use, the bigger the curl. At one point, at mean one time. This lipstick is so bright. I wonder, Kenny, I think you guys can see it in the camera, but it looks really, really bright. And then I have my eyes like a gold bronzy. black just a whole bunch of colors on my eyes. I wanted to look pretty for you guys because I was a good tore up when I got a wig. And I have eyelashes on. I wanted to look too. Same thing. I hope this helps somebody out there that doesn't know that you can do this, which I think everyone would figure it out. But I hope you guys like the way I curl my hair. And I'm just going to put this at the center of my hair like this. like the center part of my head, I don't know, that's back of my head. And so now I'm gonna take it all down. And then you just have like this couple inches left of hair and I just grab it by whatever pieces I want. Sometimes I do it in pieces like I keep when I feel like being really neat and I want my hair to look really pieced and even, which is hardly ever my hair always looks kinda messy when it comes to curling. They're all going different ways but I like that. I just like it squeaky. See, as you're going you can just grab the other hair extension. I'm just curling my hair just anyway. For the feather. I love my being so curly feathered. Makes me feel grown up. I don't know if you didn't know. I'm a hair extension freak obviously. I've been doing them since I was in eighth grade. My cousin got me some for my promotion or I know she got some for her 8th grade promotion so that I knew when I was in 8th grade I was gonna get them and she's like 3 years older than me and I just couldn't wait. It was like oh my god I can't wait to get hair extensions and I have long hair I didn't even need any but trust me I baked and I got them and I've been addicted ever since. I'm gonna, I should write a book on being addicted to hair, fake hair but whatever I like it and it makes me happy so now I know when I'm older I'm going to take this magical teasing brush. It's pink at the end of course because I love pink. I'm going to take not the top because then it's going to look all ratted and just like huge. I'm going to take the extension or the hair. It doesn't really matter. I'm just going to get the brush and go in her hair. Look at that, look at that. Tease. You're pretty. It's huge. That's what it is. You know, I already have a big head and I'm speaking a little bit bigger. Maybe I'll take a picture of my whole dress. It's really cute. Put it up in the video. Or unless you came to my work and saw me, you'd see it. You saw it already. And that is the way it teased. I just grab whatever piece I feel like I want to be big. It does like make up. There's no roll, but if this helps, a little bit. Some girls buy hair extensions, they're like what the heck did I just buy? How do I do this? Just YouTube me, you know what I mean? When I buy new hair extensions, I will put up a video of me actually sewing them, thinning them out, putting like layering different rows together so that it looks really natural. These ones they don't layer because they're like really short but that's pretty much it. hair extensions. Maybe I should open the door and see them better. And if you ever want to, if you ever work or school or walk on park and you want to move your hair extensions, all you have to do is just move the clips back a little more and you can put your hair up. And then no one would really ever know that you have hair extensions because clips, they're movable. So I hope you guys learned from the tutorial. I hope you guys like them. I hope you guys like my makeup and that's it. I hope you guys have a great night and adios.","I'm gonna curl this one in pieces because that last one didn't turn out so good but you can do it.

Both my New York City born son, a young man of fourteen, and I want everyone to know that we as Israelis are connected to and committed to the ideals of Freedom and Democracy on which America is built. All Israelis and Americans at heart believe in justice, tolerance and peace. In that sense we are truly brothers. I believe we share each other's pain.

I'm still a little nervous but I'm pretty excited to see what the results are going to be like and how amazing my body is going to be afterwards. Well I'm off to go have my surgery now. See you later. All right Kelly, welcome to the clinic today. So we're finally the day has come. We're ready for your procedure. You pretty excited? I guarantee it's gonna be a lot easier than you thought. It'll be over in no time. But the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna stand you up. We're gonna look very carefully and go over the areas again that your areas of concern. And then we're gonna snap a few photos and then I'm gonna draw on you very carefully the outline of exactly what we're going to do. Okay? Alright. Alright, we're going to take the photos. Go ahead and put your hands over your head. We're going to take four different views. Now turn and face that way please. Good? Now face the blue and face the other side. Okay. So we're going to draw very carefully on the areas that we're going to go over today. So one of the first areas that we're going to do is the abdomen. Yeah, you're not used to having people draw on you every day of the week. And these are where I'm going to put the little incisions. So there'll be five little incisions marks right there. And this is just what we call a topographical map showing the high points so that it guides us during surgery. Okay, and let's have you turn all the way around. Good. So then for you, yeah, you have such a tiny waistline up here. Once we take away this, it's going to really bring your body back into proportion like we talked about. So in medical terms, this is what we call the waist slash hips, all this up here. And then this is the outer thigh, okay? People call different things, flanks, that this is what we really... So what I like to do first is I kind of outline the buttocks where we want the buttocks to be, which is right here. This is where the buttocks should be. And then finally the outer thigh. There'll be three little incisions on each outer thigh. One, two, and three. Okay, turn around, face the front again. Perfect. All right, so we're gonna get started now We're just gonna make some just inject a little bit of novocaine and then make the tiny little holes that we talked about with this little punch boxy, okay? So you should barely feel that at all just a little poke Just overall, I'm just a lot happier with the flatter tummy and smaller everywhere else. It's exciting.

But in the last few days before the party in Essen, the team had a hard time in the sports school Hennef. Finally, the nerdy drive should not blind the hope of the rise. The FC won the last series three times, if not over the top. Jürgen Schmitz, please. 0-3 So this is how this club rises at the end of the season. Certainly not. By the way, that's our question. How often has the first FC Köln already risen in the Bundesliga? Was it once or three times? Call the number of the 0137 989, three times. The six are 500 euros to win. The team was defeated in Braunschweig a week ago, but today they won the RWE. That's it. Cialik, Lagerblom, Alper, Barut, 4-0. It was easy for them. They had a bad boost today. Barut brings back the old, old-fashioned stadium to the boil. But look at Alper's two-fighting. To be honest, that's a weakness. and he's playing the top of the league. Maybe he's going through it. Boskovic 5-0. My dear man. That was a real difference. But I think nobody expected that before the game. Irreveder is passing by Johnson and Boskovic is completely free. On the stage, Sass-Köllens president Wolfgang Overrath. What does he like?"

They created a secret branch of the organization for the French language. This branch of voices was to preserve the purity of the French language in all of the French. French languages across the world. Only in the name of the Nazis Gomer. After the liberation of France and the end of the Second World War in Europe, the Nazis' grandmothers were forgotten by the great public. But the place of terror was long forgotten. These days, they continued to travel in the shadow of the purity of the French language. I am the black man and the other part of the clothes. I am the Luke, one of them is in the living room and I am in the chamber. I heard it. Oh my God, I heard it all. The first thing is the batter at the door. The clothing, the wood, the accessories. The Christ is starting. I am even worse than his body. Good, alright. One last question. What did you say? He's a guy. He's ridiculous that you believed in the French language. He forgot the subjective? Yes. No! If you don't mind, no! I did it because it's over. I know the difference now. No! No! Please, no! Please! Do you have fire? Yes, I'm sure."

Die wacht even, mijn stors. Wat dan? Het is... Vind het gek! Maar motterbak is net Ooster. Net Opa! Vraam en uurtwerk, de zauwe broek van Hans Casander. Ik weet niet waar je het op maakt. Ik weet niet waar de snorgen bleven. Wat is hier als je stoos? Ik schrok. Wat mag er niet overgaan? Het was niet de bedoeling. Het was een aanbouwvraag voor de dich van Bacchio. Dat is weer een experiment. Er sporen in het diepe. Want jij en ben zeer benieuwd wat de mensen daar in Frankrijk gaan vinden. Wat is de serratie op een programma van 30 jaar geleden? En dan gaan we nu op televisie doen. We hebben het al twee keer op televisie gedaan. Dat was een vale kant. Ja, met poppen was het toen. Met poppen. En nu gaan we het zelf doen. Omdat we met de werelddreid door met een partijs vernieuwkerlijk hebben. Met Ferrie en ik. We zijn twee naast elkaar gedaan. Dat vond iedereen heel leuk. Toen hebben we het een hele seizoen in het theater gedaan. Dat was ook succes. Dat proberen we ook weer op de televisie. Drie mannen scheet er echt. Maar waarom maak je dan zo? Ben je bang dat het niet leuk blijkt? Want toen het hoorde dat iedereen al gelukkig ouder werd. Hij is leuk. Ik ook.","We all played the same rules. No, no, no. Big balls. Handwork. Handwork.

And we're still standing there. I'm still here. I'm still here. Behind me. Peter, Tim or Feist? Hasse, Hasse is not here. And? How many lives have you had? He's dead. I can't stop. How is it? Is it a home-made caviar? I don't want to use it anymore. How many years has it been since you started eating? Well, pizza I got yesterday with the pizza. I ate it all the time. Wait, I'll take a break. I'm so sick of it. But the bread is just like Easter. Just like Easter. I'm so tired of working here. I'm so tired of working here. I don't know where the snorkel is. I'm shocked. I'm shocked. It looks good, it's so clear, I can't even tell. But good. I have a lot of inspiration, I have to do it again. I had it yesterday. But pizza was the last big number one. But it meant you would make a real carnival hit. Do you keep your microphone away, Robin? It wasn't the intention. It was a bit of a challenge for the big of the vacation that begins on Friday. That's an experiment, a leap in the deep, because you and I are very curious about what people will find there. What is the radio program from 30 years ago? And then we're going to do television. We did that twice on television, it was a dangerous mission. With pop, it was then. With pop. And now we're going to do it ourselves, because we did it with the World War II, with the Partijs of Newkirk, with Ferrie and me, we did it together. Everyone liked it. We did it in the theater all season long, it was so successful that we tried it again on the television. Three times, really. But why do you make it so... Are you afraid that it doesn't seem fun? Because I mean, when we heard it, everyone thought it was a lucky old law. That's right, you have to make it right. The beginning of applause should have been the hardest. People clap hard when they get away. Have you made two more recordings? I'm never satisfied. I like it. But it's always better. You have to put it on the rails. It's always a premiere. He is nice.

We are going to do the film with that. Simone Kleins wants to be a guest role in a few sketches. We have songs, we are in the big market. We have a few types ourselves. Jan Wijt and Benz are with us.

Tá É importante, o autono, já que ele comece de friozinho, dia bonito, o céu mais bonito do ano, o céu de autono, as pessoas levantando um pouquinho mais cedo, já falei, os velhinhos tirando um pouco das articulações, daquela rigidez da manhã, da articulação, só de caminhar, mexer, movimentar, já faz bem. As pessoas ligam muito paradas e quando vem o frio ainda mais ainda, então é importante se movimentar e se fazer.

Good examples are always interesting for us to look and follow them, and today life is better to show a good example. A tumor that decided to make a community walk. There are a thousand people who will make a walk up to 3,000 meters around a tasty neighborhood, which is Morumbi. And we will show it to tell you about it, because walking is health. You will walk the 1500m, only the 3000m. Of course, up to 6000m if you have. Oh, that's a good thing. Hey, little team, you will walk too? You will walk a mountain and you will walk with who?

For Sunday morning, in this cold, and arriving here at 9 o'clock, when the people arrived, we had another event up there in Judo. And I'm very grateful to our people for understanding the idea of ​​the thing, right? That it's integration, it's making our club a family, and even making our house a little bit of a home. That's the goal. Have you ever walked the temple? Yes, we have a way to walk here by the father. Is the difference in your life? It's really important for the body. As a doctor, how do you see this initiative? It's important, autumn, right? Since that beginning of the cold, the beautiful day, the most beautiful sky of the year, the autumn sky. People getting up a little faster, I already talked about the old people taking off a little, right? The articulations, that rigidity of the morning, the articulation. Just walking, moving, it's good. People get very stopped and when it gets cold even more, it's important to move. I always joke, sometimes I talk about health and I say, instead of talking on the wall with a pot on the door of the house, I'll turn around in the bedroom. Here we have practically a small universe, there are a thousand athletes, people registered to walk, but their projects are more diverse. And then projects like Veriador have projects of initiatives like this. Yes, the cycle fairs, and we have several projects there, The cycle path that other veritors are joining is giving a great revolution in the city. Today you can read in the newspaper of the weekend, the cycle path has expanded a lot. I have seen and accompanied the movement of cyclists, happy with their lives, with their children, pedaling. This is very good. The transit is facilitated with the cycle path so that people can go safely. Sports activities, small jokey, next to the Boat and Tank region, with incentives for your squad, your synthetic field. Now you'll see Guimarães, my great friend, the jokey's little friends. They are small, but effective dreams that reflect people's everyday life. All the animation here, it's so beautiful. It's a logical list, let's walk, let's lose the calories and go to the event. Congratulations on the initiative and success on this walk. Will you walk 3000 meters or 1500? It seems that there will be two turns, right? The turn of 2500 and the turn of 300. Which way are you going? I'm going to 3000 meters because I have to give examples here. You see, it was this Sunday now that the sun was beautiful here in São Paulo, it's raining, right? And I keep thinking, God, the weather is beautiful, let's go home, go walk, be happy, life is outside, you see? And do you think that this person is not happy with life? Did I laugh? Wasn't it too good? Of course it was. Smile."

It is not the traditional safety approach. We focus on positive messages, not the negative. The reality is that people love to take risks. Smart risk encourages risk, smart risk.

Buckling up your seat belt may save your life, but buckles designed to protect you are everywhere, not just in cars. Buckle your life jacket, helmet, and climbing harness too. Look first. Looking first means stopping, thinking, and checking out a situation before acting. Plan your route, check for obstacles, and act only when you know what you're getting into. Wear the gear. Wearing the gear helps protect your body while you enjoy an activity. People who take their sport or job seriously know to wear protective equipment, whether that gear is a helmet, knee pads, life jacket, get trained. Getting trained includes job training, driver training, and training for a new sport. All of these can help you see where the risks lie and help you manage those risks. Learn from the experts.

Driving sober also means being 100% there when driving a car, snowmobile, ATV, etc. Free of such distractions as cell phones, loud music, and lack of sleep. There's also the stupid line. The line that separates a smart risk from a stupid risk. We each have a stupid line where we draw it as different for each person and changes depending on the current conditions, experience, and the environment. That is the smart risk philosophy. Smart risk delivers the five key messages and shares its philosophy through two award-winning programs. Smart risk heroes and smart risk no regrets. Smart risk heroes. Since the start of smart risk heroes in 1992 it has been seen by over one million million youth around the world. During the show, an injury survivor presenter speaks candidly about how the injury has affected his or her life while presenting positive choices that can be made to reduce the risk of injury. The goal is to help youth see the risks in their everyday lives and to take those risks in the smartest way possible so they can enjoy life to the fullest. Frankly, we'd do anything we could if we thought it could keep you safe, but there isn't anything we can do. You're in control. It's your choice. It's your body. It's your responsibility. It is now and it will always be as long as you live. All we can do is give you the facts and leave the choices up to you. Those are the closing lines from the Smart Risk Heroes show. Smart Risk No Regrets. It's an award-winning program that trains high school students to help their peers learn to take smart risks and prevent injury. Smart Risk No Regrets trains students and teachers to implement injury prevention activities, events, and campaigns in their schools to promote the Smart Risk Injury Prevention messages. Smart Risk No Regrets gets results. A recent evaluation found that self-reported injury declined by 17% in young people attending no-regret schools.

De Greenhouse Academy schept nieuwe opleidingsmogelijkheden. 100 studenten van de Hoge Schoole West-Vlaanderen en van Hoge Scholen uit 8 Europese landen werken samen aan creatieve oplossingen voor productinnovaties. Bedrijven als Philips, BKRT, Uniland, Tillivik, RectiCell en Rensson legden de studenten uitdagingen voor om nieuwe toepassingen te bedenken voor een product, nieuwe producten te ontwerpen of bestaande te verbeteren. De studenten industrieel ontwerpen. Elektronica, ICT en elektromechanica werkte tien dagen samen in multidisciplinaire teams. We leren als elektromechaniker, we zien het probleem, we gaan er restrikes naartoe. We gaan verschillende paanhalen bewandelen. We gaan dan elimineren wat dat is het beste idee is. En ik moet zeggen, voor mij persoonlijk is dat echt dus een verreking. Dat heb ik echt op een andere manier leren denken. De ideeën die naar boven komen, hebben wij er in zo'n zachtroofd al aan gedacht. Maar ik denk dat zij de gelegenheid krijgen om het iets dieper uit te werken. Een Belgische mechanica student of een Belgische industrieontwerper is een ideaal team dat elk bedrijf zo van dromen. Ze hebben daar niet elke dag de kans toe. Recticel legt de studenten een aparte uitdaging voor. Slim schijm of schijm met een geheugen is een nieuw soort polyuretaan. Dat je natuurlijk kan vervormen. Daar koel je dan af en dan blijft het die vorm houden. Als je na een tijdje die vorm beu bent, warm je dat terug op en krijgt het zijn originele vorm. Het is een materiaal dat nu juist opnieuw uitgevonden is. En we zoeken daar nieuwe toepassingen voor, omdat materialen te gebruiken. Toepassingen zoals? Zoals, zij gaan me vooruitwerken met een orthopedische toepassing. Zoals je nu de hips hebt. Dat kan daar ook iets ja voor zijn om dingen te fixeren. West-Vlaamse bedrijven zijn innovatiegedreven en staan open voor de bijzare ideeën van de studenten. We zijn hier naar het school gekomen omdat je hier met een diverse groep van mensen te maken hebt. Die niet zoals wij die in de industrie een beetje blind denken of in onze normale business denken. Die dus een keer het markt open kunnen gaan trekken voor ons. Maar uiteindelijk moet elk internationaal en multidisciplinaire team één concrete oplossing voorstellen aan elk bedrijf. heel veel unieke bedrijven hebben. Ik denk dat er weinig regio's zijn in Europa, waar zoveel KMO's en industriele partners zijn, voorhanden zijn, binnen een relatief kleine straal. De studenten die van andere landen komen, denk maar, Ritalia, Portugal, Spanje, hebben niet zo'n luxe aan bedrijven kunnen omhevingen, waar ze samen met projecten kunnen doen. Het zit in ons.","Students and companies work together on product innovation. The Greenhouse Academy creates new opportunities for education. Hundreds of students from the High School West Vlaanderen and from high schools from eight European countries work together on creative solutions for product innovations. Companies like Philips, BKART, UNILAND, Tillivik, RectiCell and Ransom put the students' challenges to think of new approaches for a product, to design new products or improve existing ones. The students in the industry design, Electronica, ICT and Electromechanica worked together for 10 days in multi-disciplinary teams. In the end, we have a lot of good products.

Personally, I think it is a real challenge. I really have no other way to think. We have already thought about the idea that came up in our minds. But I think they have the opportunity to work out something deeper. The Belgian mechanical student or Belgian industrial designer is an ideal team that is always dreaming. They don't have the opportunity every day. Recticel teaches students a very different challenge. A new kind of polyurethane is a bad sign or sign with a high. We have completely new material. That is a start to our development. We have a special property given to us, a normal polyurethane. It is a material that has just been invented. We are looking for new applications to use the materials. Applications like? Like they are going to use an orthopedic application, like the HEPS-app. That can also be something to fix things. West Vlaamsen companies are innovative and open to some bizarre ideas of the students. We came here to school because we have a group of people here. They don't think like we do in the industry, or in our normal business. They can open the market for us. But ultimately, each international and multidisciplinary team must present one specific solution to each company. and have a lot of unique companies. I think there are few regions in Europe where there are so many, so many industrial partners, so many companies within a relatively small line. So the students who come from other countries think, but Ritalia, Portugal, Spain, they don't have such luxury to actually have companies in a environment where they can do projects together. It's in us."

We're the Northeast Campground Association, Cindy Zawerski. We're talking about the environment and the show itself of the campground units and the attitude of the city. We understand that the sun is shining outside. My campground owners are finding what they need here, educational seminars, products and services. So they would have me during the 2009 season. Our vendors are taking orders. The kids don't know that they're not placing order here. They're taking a catalog at home. The sales are looking good. We're hearing about reservations. The Maine to Maryland are doing well. It's better than expected. Despite being here last year and we're hearing the flat is new off the and that's okay. So everyone is happy. We're here at the Springfield Sheridan. Where's your father's attendee come from? We have people from Maryland and from the top of Maine. Our vendors are from all over, from California, Wisconsin, and Texas. But our campground owners are for the most part from Maryland to Maine. In what role do you play with the association? How do you service the attendees and the members? I work in the NTA office. I publish our quarterly newsletter. And I also help with all of the exhibit booths. programming, the speakers, we have 17 seminars over the weekend, all CPO qualified. We have representatives from ARB here, from the CPO office, as well as with the ProFazer. The professors have been here, giving us one of the best. We are executive directors of all of the associations, we are present with our board meeting on Wednesday. Everybody's upbeat, and we're all, again, we're cautiously optimistic.

We're talking about the environment and the show itself of the campground units and the city's house and the activity of the campground units. We understand that the sun is shining outside. My campground owners are finding what they need here, educational seminars, products and services to what they would have needed during the 2009 season. Our vendors are taking orders. The kids don't know that they're not placing order here. They're taking a catalog at home. The sales are looking good. We're hearing about reservations. Our main to Maryland are doing well. It's better than expected. Despite being here last year and we're hearing the flat is new off the and that's okay. So everyone is happy. We're here at the Springfield Sheridan. time. Our second part. Our trade shows here on the third floor. Keep care on the fourth floor so no one has to go outside unless they choose to. And our attendees are enjoying it. It's Saturday morning. It's 10 o'clock. This place is booming. The aisles are filled. The vendors are there. They're writing orders. They're talking to people. It's a phenomenal environment farm.

We have people from Maryland and from the top of Maine. Our vendors are from all over, from California, Wisconsin, and Texas. But our campground owners are for the most part from Maryland to Maine.

That journey we think we need to go along to come in contact with this precious, this wonder, this here and now that so much talked about today. But is it really to do about saying no to certain aspects of ourselves to focus and tune in and refine certain aspects of ourselves even to the point in some of our works of even denying certain aspects to be free from the mind is one of the classical Zen and Yoga goals so to speak to come close get in contact with the Supreme Nirvana and there have been many techniques for thousands of years, encouraging people on the spiritual path to work on evolving themselves to become more refined, more spiritual. The fundamental question is, what is the success rate in this? Does it work? Do we need to come to that state called no-mind? Do we need to have that eagulous state of consciousness? My answer to that is no. We don't need this. We don't need to deny the various aspects of ourselves. The emotional side of us, the feelings that we have, the anger that is in us, the turmoil that we experience, the story within us is important and is a human condition. I feel it needs to be addressed and that human aspect of us is is not in focus. We tend to prefer to spiritualize our humanity. And I'm more interested in humanizing our spirituality. In other words, putting the human being back in the center court where it is actually us that holds the key and that in any of our searchings to come closer to God or realization, we have within us all the things we need. there is no need to block out or work on our anger or refine our feelings or deny the noise in our mind that these are all parts of us and I believe that we have an imperialistic approach to spirituality and I'm more interested in a more democratic approach where we listen to all the aspects of us and give love to these aspects instead of denial. So I see the old classical spiritual frames, the spiritual models that we use as rather clumsy in describing who we are, as human beings. For example, karma is a whole relationship, a whole problem in itself, and there's a whole works of theories on about how karma the effects of our life. I tend to look with a slight suspicion on the Indian terminology or the Eastern terminology that we adopt. Lip service in our culture here, in a sense to kind of say to ourselves that we have a hunger because we have a loss in us. Our culture, our civilisations in the West have this need, the spiritual need. over in the East for inspiration and maybe we have within us in our own culture and civilization our own answers to these things and that we don't need to all rush off to India and find some yoga master and study reincarnation and karma and work out all these laws and yoga disciplines that we are busy filling our times up with. and that the human nature itself is fundamentally more spiritual than we realize and we don't need to work on it as if it needs to be whipped into shape more to the point that we should celebrate it. And that is something that we are not good at doing. We have drifted away from that point of celebrating who we are. We feel that our egos are a problem. the way we take care of our body is a problem. There are so many aspects of denial that there is this guilt movement which is filling the interest in the spiritual circles today where I feel people are drawn to spirituality out of a sense of guilt and blame rather than out of a sense of celebration. And the here and now is a kind of a classical example that has been well documented and people are paying lip service to it, that it's a space which is the Zen classical intellectual approach that is a nothingness, that there's no mind, there's no ego. And that is contradictory to how I experience being in contact with myself and that it's very much a dynamic space, that it's not an emptiness, it's not a vacuum, that the mind and the ego and my pain and my anger and my past and my future are all here together. And it is very much a dynamic force, so to speak, that I enjoy being connected to. And it is a celebration to live life to the fullest. And to blame or to deny some quirks in us, which we see is irrelevant as some sort of body connection which is unpure or impure or heavy or dark even. It's a misunderstanding of the process of celebrating life."

We have blast off. So here we are and there he is and as you can see here blast off is a Cybertronian space shuttle and he's very Very finny. There's lots of lots of fins going on there. Whole lot of fins, but um, yeah some nice some nice detailing. It's a cool design. I do like it I like the purple they used Throughout to pick out some details. I'm a lot of molded and detailing and these pieces here that are done in silver very nice very cool As you can see it does have his weapons with just peg in they peg in here and they peg in here because as you can see they have Two posts and that's basically how you plug it in you plug this post in there And you plug this post into the side and that and there is your your weapon storage Like that so he does have the two guns Ah, I'm dropping everywhere as you can see you know some nice detail and it would have been nice had they been you know painted a little but you know, they're still still pretty cool pretty cool so he has those and Yeah, that's pretty much all the rest to him. He's a Cybertronian space shuttle. Um, he does have another alternate mode. He does have a Cybertronian drill mode I'm a genius. I'm insane. My doctor told me so. But yes, there he is. There's Blassoff in his space shuttle mode. Now for his limb modes now for his foot mode or foot slash shin mode, whatever you want to call it. To get to that very simply, you just want to take these pieces of the fin, fold them all the way back like that, bring that forward to expose the combiner ports, And there he is. That's the foot mode. There you go. It's a big, spiky foot mode. That's basically it. Now, to get him into his proper mode, which is the arm mode, how you're going to do that is you're going to untab these pieces all together. If I can get this down. Come on. Get him out. You want to bring this down and bring this down. And then you're going to I always forget how to do this. You want to bring these forward like that and then you want to do something else. Ah! I know what you're doing. You want to bring them. You gotta bring them together like this. You gotta plug it together right there. Like that. Ah! See? I know things. I know things. There you go. You want it in this configuration right there. and then you just bring the combiner port down like that and basically you're just going to flip out the hand which is right in here which can be hard to get out come on man come on come on come on come on there you go back together come on come on why are you fighting me man there you go they just want to flip out the thumb also like that and there you have excuse me there you have Bruticus's arm. This is the one people complain about because this one is very Gorilla-like once you get it combined. It's very long, but there was a way to fix that and I'll show you once I get to the combined Bruticus mode. But yeah, again, he can serve as a left or right arm. All you have to do is just flip the thumb up and guess what? There's another thumb on this side. You can just flip that thumb down and yay! Now you can be the other arm. So it's a neat little touch. Again, the little scramble city aspect kind of unnecessary, but it's still pretty cool. Now to get to robot mode, what you're going to do is you're going to take these halves, bring them together like that, and bring these legs forward like that. You're going to split this whole section right here and lift it up on this arm like that and just leave them there for the time being. You're going to oops I always had these legs rotated the wrong way. You want to have them rotated this way so these details are facing out. I always seem to mess that up. Flip that back up. Come here. Detach this section. Flip back this little hatch. Make room for the head. Bring that down. Now we'll clip into place. Close that back up. Now you want to take these arms here and this tab will tab into these slots right here. So I'm going to take that and push it in. and pull the arm down and pull the arm down and there you have him! There is Blastoff in his robot mode and he is a cool design I do like him I love his shoulder pads I don't care what mascot says I love his shoulder pads I think he's a good guy They look really really cool. Head sculpt. Head sculpt is pretty nice. This whole figure definitely could have benefited from a little more paint. He does look kind of kind of plain. But you know it's still a cool design. You know I do still like it. Articulation wise his head can rotate 360 a little bit of up and down movement but not much. The arms the shoulders here are all ball joints but you don't get that You can get a double jointed elbow on a ball joint. You can get forward and backward movement on the hips. You can get a very good range of movement on the knees. I don't care about the way I like to do it. the design of him. He has a little hollow, I mean his arms are pretty thin and there's really nothing going on back here. I do like that they did bother to you know at least mold in some details in there, you know, there's some molded in like suspension and whatnot. So, you know, they tried, you know, at least they tried even the thrusters here they molded in. So I mean the bits that are hollow at least they did try to add some detail. But yeah, I like blast off. I like his big shoulders, his big bash shoulder pads. I think they look cool. He has a cool design. Again, just could have benefited from a little more paint. But I think that is pretty much all there is to say about the sky. So there is the San Diego Comic Con Exclusive Fall of Cybertron blast off.

I mean dumb stuff that happens or opportunities that just present themselves as you're playing. But this is one of those cases easier to show you than it is to tell you. So let me show you. You know, from a show about improv, I suck at it. One of the things that we as human beings have as a fault is that we're predictable. We fall into patterns. So if somebody's in a spot over here, they're going to keep coming out of the same area over and over again. Or they'll try to mix it up and like switch sides and come out of the same area on the other side. So what you need to do is improvise. You need to break out of the patterns. You need to break off of what you normally do. So this is an example of this. Let's say that there's this guy right here. And I'm right over there. Now let's say I have to flank in order to get this guy. But you don't want to do it in a predictable way because he'll just sweet spot and he'll hit you. So you break up the pattern. Again, it's just a matter of breaking up the pattern. If you're following along, you probably expected me to break the plane over here. That's where the guy would have sweet spotted me. That's why I stopped in front of this barricade right here. That's what I mean by improv. There's no way to plan for this on the field. I mean you can think about it but Odds are you're not going to think about doing that. It's a matter of seeing it on the fly. It's a matter of seeing it as you're playing. Now same thing goes for when you're behind a stagnant bunker. Kind of like this one. You don't want to start getting into any kind of a pattern because the other team is going to notice this and you are going to get smoked. You know it's like playing you know one of those whack-a-mole games. Yeah, you figure out the pattern then you start. Yeah, so what you want to do is you want to break up the rhythm Don't come out every second and a half come out once wait a little bit longer come out again then quickly come out Keep on moving the pattern around you don't want to make it predictable then change up where you come out come out one side come out the other side go low and shoot out the corner go high Do anything you can to break up the pattern break up the rhythm now something else that might happen to you on the field chicken and improvise about is gun problems Alright, fine. This is a technology sport. Things happen. Your gun might go down. Your hopper might completely break. You might have so much paint broken in your barrel that it's just dripping out through the holes. Well, that doesn't mean you're eliminated, so for crying out loud, don't call yourself out. You're still in the game. Still think like a team player. If you're in the back of the field, you can start acting like a quarterback. Start calling out the positions of the other team so that you can tell your team where the bad guys are. Another guy in the center even if you still have your gun don't drop it and start running even most of times if you just point your gun at somebody They'll duck they might figure it out real quick that you can't shoot back at him But that'll buy you a second or two just keep in mind that as long as you're in the game You're still in the game and besides one of your teammates might be able to help you out if you're not a painter if you're out of air or something Or like me if you're like an idiot and you forgot to turn your safety off the show and that is try dumb stuff. Stupid ideas do work once in a while. I want to emphasize it's once in a while, not all the time. I mean, stupid things like running along the snake side where there's no tall cover, nobody would expect that, or crawling underneath somebody's line of fire so they can't see you, although it looks to everybody else like you're crawling out in the middle of nowhere, or even shooting somebody and then quickly angle out so that when they're tucked in, you're at a new spot. Now these sound like really dumb ideas sometimes, But if it was a dumb idea and it worked, odds are it wasn't that dumb an idea. things, you can go far. Catch you next week.

Now the school district is calling this a warning for teachers and almost does in principals, but come May 100 educators may lose their job. It creates angst within that community. The Stockton Unified School District gave out almost 100 preliminary layoff notices to teachers, counselors, even 11 principals. That's going to destabilize 11 schools. So they're going to be deal with the uncertainty, the disruption and the chaos. Eugene Jackson is a retired Stockton principal. He says he was shocked to hear the superintendent's decision. He says it's a decision that will affect students. Stability is one of the most important things that you can have on a school site. You need to know who's going to be there, who's in charge. Diane Barth with the Stockton Unified School District says the notices are preliminary before the state mandated March 15th deadline. She said it could all change come May. Are we going to take much of a dip in enrollment? Probably not. We'll probably need close to the same number of teachers we have this year. here. However, you also have to look at the budget so we don't know what the state budget is going to be. Barth says any principles released will be replaced and the replacement will be up to the superintendent. He has increased the rate expected in the schools for any expects our students to perform well no matter where the schools are located and so there is an increased expectation. Now the school district also tells us the amount of teachers retiring could fit could affect the amount of teachers that they may have to lay off come May. Reporting live in Stockton, I'm Melinda Meza, KCRA 3 Report. Melinda got asked, do we know which schools are affected by these potential layoffs? Well, we don't know which schools and they did not release the names of the teachers or the principals who received these preliminary layoff notices. We did learn today, however, that 10 of the 11 principals who received notices are from elementary schools, but that's all we know so far. big impacts headed that way. Okay, Melinda, thanks for that.","We begin with this tonight. Principles in Stockton put on notice. Nearly a dozen warned that they may soon be joining the unemployment line. Good evening.

He tells the Congress, he gives them a state of the union address to tell them how things are going in our country. He's supposed to be aware of all that. And every single bill crosses his desk. He doesn't propose them. He can't vote on them. He can't bring them to the, he can present them just like individuals can present new bills. He can't make the House bring it to committee, he can't take it out of committee, he can't do any of those things. He can only sign it after they've approved it. But, he does have input. He's totally allowed to have input. But I would argue that there is, even though the President has no power to legislate, he only has the power to confirm the legislation afterwards, he has no power to regulate, he has no power to tax, he has no power to do all of these things. the sole greatest power that the president has. Does anybody have any idea? Oh, they are. You said military. Wrong. I'll give you that the military is very important. But there was very little military action from 1791 to... V-O. V-O. Precisely. He said, I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States and most of the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. So any government intrusiveness can be stopped by one man alone. At the same time, with that great power to stop, he also had the great power to give it freely. But if you ever had a president that was strong enough to resist the power, the temptation to take more power to the federal government, you would have the strongest president. And we had that after the signing of this document. George Washington had the opportunity to be king of the United States. They wanted to vote as king as long as he would live. And he said now I want to serve my country I'm giving the military back as general to the United States Congress They're responsible for them during times of peace and I am going home Until I'm to be president and after I'm president he went back home lived for two years and died Because he said my role is is to be as a powerful man I need to resist all of the power that could be given to me and that is the most powerful opportunity that a president could ever have. He has civilian power over the military, as you guys all know, and again in section three he gives a State of the Union address. Just follow up the question at the end. Exactly the borders. Well let's follow up at the end. At the end we'll get that. Again the State of the Union is section three and then what disqualifies a president? They have things such as treason, bribery, other high The two crimes and misdemeanors, those are not well defined, but I think that treason is well defined according to our founders. Now we have the judicial branch, the system of justice, the courts. That is Article 1 section, sorry, that's Article 3 of our constitution. So you have Article 1 is the Congress, you have two houses, you have Article 2, that's the president, and you have Article 3, so we have this balance of power. we go back to our roadmap. So our roadmap shows us that Article 1 focuses all the power. This is the central piece of the document. You have the president, he gets a small little piece over here, and even the judiciary gets a smaller piece. And that's our roadmap right there of where the Constitution takes us as far as what the federal government is allowed to do. So we're at the system of justice. You have the Supreme Court. It has very specific jurisdictions. It has powered to institute smaller courts to deal with more day-to-day issues. The Supreme Court will hear only, this is very interesting, it only hears those cases that the Congress allows them to hear. Now no one would ever think that the Congress had the power of the courts, but interestingly enough the only people that have the power over the president and the justice system is the Congress because it represents the people. The judges you'll see in there are appointed by the president and they're confirmed by the Congress. If they're not confirmed by the Congress then they don't represent the people. The Congress can limit, and I'll tell you exactly where, in all cases ambassadors, the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be a trial by jury and such trial shall be held in the state where the crimes have been committed. But when not committed in any state, a trial shall be in such places that Congress may by law have directed. I'm sorry, here we are. Just above that. You see section three, you see the paragraph above that. It says in all cases of ambassadors, ministers, the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction, original jurisdiction. In all cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both in law and in fact. With exception, And under such a regulation as the Congress shall make So you have congressional power all the power is held by the houses that are representative of the people and That is an important point that's often missing We hear about Supreme Court justices or or Supreme Court courts that are legislating from the bench and they can be limited by Congress on what they're allowed to legislate and how and how it affects are everyday lives. Something to think about. Article 4 is the states. What can the states do? Well there's a lot more the states can do, but just in case there was any question the states are doing these things uniformly throughout the United States. They will give full faith and credit shall be given to each state, the public acts, the records, the proceedings of every state, and the Congress by General Law prescribes a manner that these acts and records are given to the public. Now the citizens of each state, let's say you move from Florida to Alabama to Georgia to South Carolina, all of the laws in the state of Florida are respected in the laws of Alabama. Now they have additional laws and there's no limitation on state taxes in the Constitution because states can tax differently than the government can. But you have all the privileges, immunities in all the states to to do as you would do in your original state, which is a very important thing. Most, you look at the European Union or you look at some of these other communities that they're trying to do free trade agreements with, and there is not that seamless movement of commerce, of communication, of just relationships between the government and its people. And I think that that's a very important thing. We are one nation as we all say and that's one of the ways that we show we're one. We don't have divided laws that limit what each citizen can do in different states. Now how does a new state come to the Union? Well that's of course determined by Congress. And every state in Section 4 is guaranteed to be a Republican form of government. Now this isn't a class to talk about the different forms of government but I'll just give you a brief synopsis. Democratic form of government means that everybody gets to vote on everything all the time. Which means that the little kid in the school yard gets beat up by a bigger number of kids. So it's not representing individuals, it's representing the masses, the majority. And that's not always a good thing. Because what if the masses want something bad for you? Then you have a socialist form of government which means the government can plan and tell you what to do with your own life effectively better than you can. And I think we would all question that. We have a representative republic. A representative republic. Republic means rest public power, rule by law. And that means that they have to be bound to laws and they're representing us. We don't have to decide on every law. We don't have to know how much money is, or we don't have to vote on how much money is spent on our military, but we get to know about it. We're represented. And I think that is an important distinction from democracy, which some people say is being spread around the world because that's not a valuable thing. Article 5 is an interesting amendment or an interesting article. It's the idea that this is a living document. Typically, when you hear somebody say that our Constitution is a living document, you all would disagree with it. I would agree with them. But they're always talking about Article 1, Section 8, where you have the commerce clause where you can do anything you want or you have the necessary and proper clause where you can do anything you want or you have the welfare clause where you can do anything you want. However, the founders knew they weren't perfect and the amendment process is the only way","The president shall receive just compensation, he gets paid for what he does.

Much of the free world, Europe and US included, recognizes the extent of terrorism in Iranian regime's policy and doctrine; however they only go as far as making reference to Iranian regime sponsorship of terrorism outside Iran in particular the extremist groups in the Middle East, Hezbollah and Hamas, but they fail to recognize and talk about the domestic victims of terrorism or those freedom-loving Iranians who have been victims of such policy. Dr. Abdul-Rahman Ghassemlou, then the Secretary General of Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan was one of those great Kurdish-Iranian leaders who fell victim to this policy of exterminating dissidents through terror.  He was gunned down in the heart of Europe in 1989 in Vienna by the terrorist-diplomats of the Islamic regime in Iran. The Iranian people, the Kurds of Iran in particular, are still awaiting a thorough investigation into this case and bringing justice to those who have perpetrated this and many other heinous acts of terror against Iranian freedom-activists. This July 13 marks the 22nd anniversary of Dr. Ghassemlou and his aides; Human Rights Activists Association at York University and The Greater Toronto Kurdish House are hosting an event to discuss the various dimensions of Iranian regime's state terrorism as related to Dr. Ghassemlou and other victims' of Iranian state terrorism. Right to justice is a fundamental human rights and in the same context also discussing the current human rights situation in Iran as related to those who have been unjustly victims of Iranian regime's terror and repression machine would also be on the agenda for this event.","Terrorism, Canada, toronto, Kurdistan, Soraya Fallah, Iran, Dr. Ghassemlou, Islamic Republic of Iran",369,4,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/j19j-8JQKVo.mp3,I'm on the top of the mountain and my wounds are very deep.

Yo creo que esta partida, que nosotros permitimos cuando venen de Cobillas, es la real encarnación definitiva del espíritu de Hugo Chávez, en el pueblo, en primer lugar en su república bolivariana y en segundo lugar de América entera, de la América que como decía Martí, nace al sur del río Bravo y llega hasta la metabuaca.

Winston, today we are celebrating and remembering a month of the game of the Comandante Hugo Chávez. What does the work of Hugo Chávez mean and what has he given to you in Latin America? I think that this game that we allowed when we went to Covillas, that is the real definitive incarnation of the spirit of Hugo Chávez, The first place is the town of El Borro de El Charro de Almas. It is the town of the Republic of Bolivariana. And the second place is the whole of America. The city of Marthi. It is born in the south of the Rio Gravo. And it is the city of El Borro de El Charro de Almas. And the problem is that Latin America is discussing this issue. We have been in Caracas, in Marcos, in an international meeting of poets, writers, poets, and social children, not only in Latin America, but all over the world, they have been friends with the Xaves' daughter and reaching conclusions that are fundamental reality. We are recovering and recovering the Xaves legacy, but at the same time we have to keep it in mind. to fight against attacks, which is not to be left, but to fight against defense, and also to attack the neoliberalism, and not capitalism. Capitalism, imperialism, neoliberalism are the same, which simply means the death of the human pure. And in that sense, the word of Chavez, the word of hope, the word of life, the word of progress, of independence, solidarity and indianism. to Hugo as a kind of son of his own. Cuban heritage is fundamental. It cannot be forgotten. Latin America began its second independence defeat with the attack on the port of Mioncada on July 26, 1250. And, for example, this with the take on Havana in January 1550. Since then, Latin America has not been the same. I think that is already unbeatable. I would like to say that the second class of Habana, to conquer the second and to be independent. The people of Chávez have a conscience, a rationality, that Chávez has for the people of America. For the children, for the people of the two tribes that loved the Umi and the areas that have the other properties. They are the ones who vote for Chávez. And the ones that don't like it are the majority. The majority is going to go to Calavero. and obviously on April 14th, the cause of the explosion will be re-enabled in the moment because of the Maduro, an excellent and popular movement, a young and popular movement in the centers of the people and the police."

Efectivamente, Alcaldeza, su trabajo diario, tiene más de 181.309 razones para trabajar por cada aceite sea una ciudad más justa. Y siento decirle que mi opinión, estos presupuestos que nos han presentado, tienen cualquier objetivo menos el de justicia social. Como ciudadana, me sorprende su empeño en disminuir la deuda que efectivamente tenemos, exclusivamente a través de recortar partidas sociales, como así como la ausencia absoluta devolvente política para poner en marcha el modelo económico y social que demanda la ciudadanía, los ciudadanos y ciudadanas de Al Pacete, como se demuestra en las firmas recogidas que también le traigo y cuya implantación posibilitaría un desarrollo social y sostenible de nuestra ciudad. Pero ustedes han rechazado en los días previos escuchar, no solo atender sino solo escuchar las aportaciones que hasta fin con Grupo les hemos intentado presentar en estos días, en concreto la muestra incluye hasta el compromiso de alcanzar el cero al cien de, alcanzado en el pacto contra la pobreza, recortando por supuesto de otras partidas como cargos de confianza. Estos presupuestos justos siguen a su disposición si quisieran leerlos. El proyecto presentado por ustedes de presupuestos es claramente regresivo en lo relativo a políticas sociales, puesto que la dotación de la mayoría de las partidas sociales se ve gravemente reducida. También se ve una falta de prioridad por la sociedad que se refleja en detalles como por ejemplo que el presupuesto para prensa en las dependencias municipales sea del rango, ustedes van a dedicar el mismo rango de presupuesto que a proyectos y actividades de inserción social o por ejemplo que a subvenciones educativas, que nosotros incrementaríamos simplemente con que cada uno se leiese el periódico que su falta de voluntad en priorizar los intereses ciudadanos de Albacete también se pone de manifiesto en el modo en el que se están realizando los recortes. Solo en el apartado 1 proclaban haber hecho una reducción del 2%, es el apartado de personal y desgraciadamente observo que está basado en despidos y ceses de servicios como trabajadores de escuelas infantiles o como personal de la sección de empleo y formación de este ayuntamiento. Para nadie se le escapa el alto interés social de todos ellos. En cambio, mantienen el 1% de esa partida dedicado a personal de confianza, hasta medio millón de euros, y un 1% también de gratificaciones extraordinarias fuera de complementos de destino, productividad, etcétera, etcétera. Quizás sería una necesaria una revisión sobre la eficacia de esas partidas y una mayor transparencia para que si de verdad estoy equivocada en algo, pudiera haberlo comprobado, aunque es. de hacer esta intervención. no digo nada en detrimento de la banda municipal ni de la cultura. Lo que estoy diciendo es que ese sueldo equivale a seis investigadores de la universidad. ¿Acaso, señora alcaldesa, también podemos permitirnos unos gastos en secretaría general de nuestro ayuntamiento en un presupuesto de papelería que asciende a 120.000 euros al año? Eso, para que se hagan una idea, es el dinero del que les pone un grupo de investigación en cáncer de colon para tres años y aquí se destinan a papelería de un solo año. Con consideran que esa inversión beneficia a los ciudadanos de Albacete y que Albacete se lo puede permitir. Como le digo, son pequeñas píldoras y el documento de presupuesto a Cristo está a su disposición si todavía lo quieren ver. Gracias.","I come from a citizen's perspective. Indeed, the mayor of Caldeza has more than 189,000 reasons to work for each city because it is a fairer city. I feel that my opinion on these assumptions that have presented us has any objective, except for social justice. As a citizen, I am surprised that they are doing their part to reduce the debt that we have exclusively through cutting social parties, as well as the absence of the and the absolute will of politics to set the economic and social model that the citizens of Al Pacete demand as shown in the collected signatures that I also bring to you, whose implementation would possibly be a sustainable social and social development of our city. But you have rejected, in the previous days, listening, not only to attend, but to listen to the contributions that up to five groups have tried to present in these days, specifically the The project presented by you from the budget is clearly regressive in relation to social policies, since the adoption of most parties is a very important part of the project. social issues are greatly reduced. There is also a lack of priority for society, which reflects in detail, such as the budget for press, in municipal dependencies, be it the range you are going to dedicate to the same budget range as projects and social insurance activities, or for example educational subsidies, which we would simply increase with each one being read the newspaper that is valid. The lack of will to prioritize the citizen's interest in Albacete is also put in the way in which the cuts are being made. Only in section 1 they proclaimed to have reduced the 2%. It is the personal section and I unfortunately observe that it is based on dismissals and services such as children's schools workers or as a personal of the section of employment and training of this aid. For anyone, the high social interest of all of them is avoided. Instead, they maintain 1% of that game dedicated to trust, up to half a million euros, and 1% of extraordinary gratifications, including destinations, productivity, etc. Perhaps it would be necessary to review the effectiveness of those games and a greater transparency, so that if I'm really wrong about something, I could have checked it, even if... Mr. Ballot, Mr. López Garrido, with these suggestions you can answer the following questions. Why does the presupport party of the symphonic band Don Francisco Grau raise to 180,000 euros and is superior to the official development aid? That salary, Mr. Alcaldeza, if you don't know, is equivalent to six researchers of our university here in Albacete. Acazzo can allow Albacete I do not say anything about the municipal or cultural side of the project. What I am saying is that this salary is equivalent to six university researchers. In case of Mr. Alcaldesa, we can also allow some general expenses of our settlement in a budget of paper that is 120,000 euros per year. This is to make an idea of ​​the money that a group of research in colon cancer provides for them three years and here they are drawn to paperwork for a year. They will consider that investment benefits the citizens of Albacete and that Albacete can afford it. As I say, they are small pillars and the document of the budget of Jesus is available if they still want to see it. Thank you."

Кто еще не определился, дать понять, что такая возможность есть. Ну, они консусмены сами поймут. Им это интересно. Будут ли они заниматься в детских объединениях Москвы именно этим профилем? Или они выберут какое-то другое детское движение? Ну, о том, что они выберут какое-то детское объединение, теперь мы уже не сомневаемся.

He recently started to work in the industry and has returned to the old bank. He is a salesman. Ye Mingzhi said that he would rather make money by making money by selling his car. to introduce the advantages of the car but how familiar the salesman is with the original body and the harmony of the smile is not the artist Ye Mingzhi? It's strange why you are selling cars here? Yes, I explained to them that before I entered the industry circle I was selling cars here this is my main business. So Ye Mingzhi was a car salesman for eight years before entering the industry circle until the filming of the telecom advertisement made him a big hit I know your sincerity. You can call me when you have time. I will call you when I have time. Go. Go. Go. Go. Don't be afraid. It's just a smile. Ten years ago, the old bird brought a commercial to everyone. It also made the famous businessmen become artists. And the idol group of the living school. It's just a bad chance to be a real artist. But the number of visitors is 5 or 6 million. But the number of visitors is reduced by 2.5 million. It's just a return to the old business. I told them that it's better for you to go back to the shop to sell cars. The big carbon industry circle can survive, but it's not easy to get a new face. The company has been selling out dozens of cars for less than a year. Now, they still have a chance to get a notice. Both sides are earning money. They only hope to have two more customers."

The BI is an internationally unique program available only at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. It is a hands-on experiential learning program where students learn innovation by doing. It is a family of degrees with a common core in innovation and teaming. Innovation is a team sport. In this video we'll introduce you to some of the BI faculty, some of the students, some of the advantages of the program. Let's start with a bit of why we need it. Studies show that 50% of the US economic growth is due to innovation. innovation. You probably hear the term innovation all the time. Why then is there no undergraduate program teaching innovation? It's actually really important that we as a country start embracing changing the way we are teaching our students. So the Bachelor of Innovation is innovation in the way we teach engineering and business students. Bringing them together in the first semester and having four years of interactive teams is fundamentally changing how we're teaching these students. My name is Nina Pollock and I'm the program executive for the Bachelor of Innovation program here at UCCS. I am Dr. Tim Shammler, but I go by Dr. T. and I've been here at ECCS since January of 2003. In terms of an employer picking somebody with a Bachelor of Science versus a Bachelor of Innovation, particularly these days in the engineering field, I think it's a very important thing to do. I am working on this program for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Here at UCCS I like that there's real world applications. by accompanying, have a lot more to offer, they have a lot more to put on the table, in the sense that they can talk in terms of management skills, and when making references to what happens on the technical side, they've got the hands-on skill, whereas somebody else that is interviewing for that job, They will probably only be able to be put into the management, non-technical side, or the technical side. My name is Kirk Stock. I am my first semester at UCC. I've been teaching about 13 years. I was an engineer before then, both bachelors and masters degree, hockey and engineering, and I worked for several companies in the high-tech industry, different high-tech industries before I went to grad school to be a PhD in business. because I wanted to do some other things. So I am relatively new to Colorado but now I'm new to the teaching. Working in an interdisciplinary environment is the way most businesses operate now or at least they're trying to operate and it's only going to become more and more prevalent. So one of the advantages of BI student will have, whether it's a BI in business, a BI in game design and development, a BI in Launchable Engineering, is that they will have the opportunity to work in that environment and understand that reality from the first day they step into the classroom as a college student. In almost any other major they're going to stay within their discipline, whether it might be business or engineering, and they won't get that opportunity. And that's, I think, an advantage that most students are not going to have unless they have a Bachelor of Innovation degree. My name is Kyle Roushius. I'm a junior in the Bachelor of Innovation program at UCCS. developed a game called I Says for the iPhone along with a fellow Bachelor of Innovation student, Tim Martin. And it's available on the App Store and through iTunes, downloadable for $3. management and how all of this impacts teaming. Sophomore students learn business and intellectual property law and submit patents. They practice technical and proposal writing and presentations. We help students become effective presenters. Students take courses in entrepreneurship and pitch business plans to community members in their first year. We've had such teams partner to win government contracts with real companies. We've also launched startup businesses. We regularly partner with local entrepreneurs to develop and launch new products and win government contracts. Our game design and development students have worked with Dr. to develop educational games for our new science and engineering building. Teams of students are now doing educational simulation games as part of an NSF SPIR with a local company. Our student teams take part in real proposals for real money and have helped our partners win nearly $2 million in our first three years of operation, with many students being paid to work on their innovation teams. All of this is in parallel with the standard core of courses for their major. The BI business takes the same business courses as the BS. The BI and Co. computer science and the BI and computer security are technically rigorous the same number of computer science credits as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BI and electrical engineering is both theoretically rigorous and hands-on, while new majors like the BI in game design and development are breaking new ground. We're working to add a new range of majors for next year. Check our website for details. Innovation is a team sport transforming ideas into impact.

I'm in San Jose at the Search Ancient Strategies Conference with Karen Crisk, who is an expert in search marketing. And we were talking about landing pages, particularly, you mentioned a term which I really thought was interesting. You need to warm them up before you try to sell them. What do you mean by that in this context of landing pages? Right. If you look at most marketers paid search programs or search programs, programs, a much higher percent of traffic comes from new visitors than some of their existing or their other marketing programs like email marketing or catalog or some other kind of offline advertisements. And so most of the consumers that are coming to their page have never seen that company's offer before. They really don't understand the overall benefit from buying from their company. And so if you sometimes lead them right into the product page or right into a grid or category page, it's almost too much information and the messaging, the the company and again the service offering or the product offering gets lost in the pages. I know some people they have it's a retail site and you know well a title, a picture, a description and an order now button. Right. But you're saying they don't have the context they're not quite ready yet. Right. They in as direct marketers most of my clients are they do want to make the sale right away and search is great for that but there are times especially when the product is pretty complex that there's There's a lot to communicate and there's maybe some benefits around buying specifically from that company. That term you want to warm them up. You want to be able to communicate clearly what are the benefits, especially if buying from that company, especially if you are in a competitive marketplace. Because if you're going there and saying if my prices are the same as my direct competitors, what differentiates that from my company? So that's where testing this warming up page would work. Not just features right benefits the company that one company way that I love their stuff is landsend You read their the descriptions of their products and they make you feel warm by the time you finish right because they're so descriptive and They're touching your emotions right It's fascinating to someone with a skill to be able to write that kind of copy And now on a cold day you read that you know for this kind of coat, you know and how it warms you up and you feel like there I mean obviously that's what happened with Starbucks too. I mean you walk into that, I mean the coffee smell and if you look at the colors that they use, they're very warm colors, it's a nice environment and then you're handing over $5 for something that used to be a dollar for or less than that. And that's a good way to look at some of these pages is creating that kind of brand equity which means I want to buy from a company that is like this. This is like me, I like how that way makes me feel. Then I'll buy the products from them. It's making it feel comfortable and buying from you. Well it's a fascinating thing to make people want to buy when they come to the page rather than just give them the stark information. Right. So it's an art I'm sure not just a science this whole thing. Right. Hey thanks so much for showing me this. Tell me about your company and what you do. Bright Cloud Marketing.

For at fylde kapslen op med viske, skal vi starte med at have lovet heraf. Ta her efter din viske og held den ned i kapslen indtil du er ca. 3-4 mm fra kanten. Her efter så tager vi blot lovet og presser på igen. Når du sætter kapslen ned i atomiseren, vil du kunne risikere, at der her omkring spejken samler sig nogle luftbobler. For at fjerne dem, kan du forsøge banke på siden her og koden. Du kan helge e-sikkeraten på hudet og tilbage igen. Eller du kan forsøge at dreje selv i munstykket i en omgang eller to.

The battery is already fully charged when you take it out of the box. We first charge the battery in between 6 and 8 hours. After the charge, we can switch to the charger in between 4 and 6 hours. Here we have the atomizer and the power button. To connect the battery and the atomizer, we need to connect the battery and the power button. and press down in the atomizer. To fill the cap with the bag, we must start by having the box here. Take it here after your bag and hold it down in the cap until you are about 3 to 4 mm from the edge. Hereafter, we take the box and press it on again. When you put the cap down in the atomizer, you will be able to risk that the air bubbles around the bag will gather. To remove them, you can try to put the bag on the side here at the bottom. You can hold the E-cigarette on the head and press it again, or you can try to turn the mouthpiece itself in turn or two.

Okay? Now think about the problems we've been doing. Okay? What is currently with the variable? What is with the variable? Sarah? Well, the plus sign, but I mean, if this wasn't here, that, okay? So I'm not really talking about the plus sign. What is the m? The m's not by itself right now. Maggie H? You mean it has 11 negatives with it? What would make those 11 negatives cancel out and go away? What would make them go away, Ian? How many positives? Seven positives would make 11 negatives go away? 11 positives. So that means I need to combine 11 positives down here. Do you agree with me on that? Okay, but wait a minute. Wait a minute. You can tell me what we're talking about here, Suzette. This is algebra. And in algebra, Suzette, whatever I do to one side, I have to do to the other. So if I put 11 positives on the left side at CB, I need to put 11 positives on the right side. Now, just like the problems we've been doing, what happens when I combine 11 negatives and 11 positives? What happens, Katharine? You get zero, or they cancel out. Same thing, right? These just go away. And it leaves me with what? What does it leave me with over there? Christina? Elm. negative four and positive eleven, what does that leave me with? Maggie H? Positive seven.

But what should we do first here? Christina? Let's simplify all of these things. Should that be t plus 13 or t minus 13? What do you think, Christina? How many negatives are there in front of the 13? There are three. Is that an odd or an even number? And what does odd mean? So it should be t minus 13. Is equal to, what should that number on the other side be? Harry? Negative 12. Because I have three negatives on that side. How do I make the negative 13 go away? Or 13 negatives go away, okay? I need positive 13s to cancel them out. But, Suzette, what is this? So I need to do it to the other side also. Okay? Now, what happens when I combine these two things, Sam? They cancel out. And what am I left with over here on the left side? Not one. Not one. What am I left with over there, Sarah? Not negative one. On the left side of this equation, that's this side over here. I'm left with t, Sam, thank you.

Quindi mi piace toccare la scarpa, quindi penso che una donna quando indossa la sua scarpa sente la qualità e l'attenzione ai particolari dove anche queste linee, queste vene che ha la scarpa che vengono percorsa illuminate da questi bordini che secondo me sono dei fiumi d'oro, l'alluminano e la rendono qualcosa di speciale, di unico e estremamente femminile sensuale.","In this case we can see something that is familiar to the family. The plateau. This plateau was called Mohoch, like Moicanos. Because this crest gives and marks the shape and the tone of our plateau in the fall and winter season.

Paulson  The IMF is uniquely positioned to identify best practices for sovereign wealth funds, building on existing guidelines for foreign exchange management, Mr. Paulson said in the text of remarks to be delivered before the IMFs policy-steering committee, which is convening as part of the annual meeting of the IMF — and its sister organization the World Bank — in Washington this weekend.   Sovereign wealth funds, government-owned pools of capital, have attracted attention of policy-makers as the size of their assets has exploded and their activity in equity investment has grown. Developed countries, the recipients of much of the investment from sovereign wealth funds, are worried growing cross-border investment could feed protectionism. They want the funds to commit to transparency and market-based investment principles.

We thank in the name of our colleagues absolutely all of them if each of the things we have done for us. We have been accompanied by you along our way and we have tried to guide you and advise you to do so with our future once this day comes. The truth is that you have been living with us day after day, holding our swords and our swords. In addition, we are holding the most sacred sword of the smile.

And for this reason, so that everyone is aware of your work, we have wanted to recognize your important work in public. and nobody will hurt you.

Сегодня мы будем готовить фаршированные цукини с сюрпризом из моцарелла внутри. Фаршировать нашу цукини мы будем фаршем из мяса с травом лука. У меня 5 небольших цукини которые я уже подмылой и почистила. У меня вот такой чесночок. Это наверное два зубчика чеснока. Петрушка. В принципе можно использовать любую зелень для фарши обычно лучше кинзу. Но кинзу я не нашала. 500 грамм мяса. Страдаем в тесто. мы сделали 10 стаканчиков и теперь за нем все фарши. Для этого с вами компания я размельчу одну среднюю луковицу, два зубчика чеснока, половину пучка петрушки и добавлю туда половину той начинки, которая у нас получилась в ходе вочерения наших стекли. Сознание произошла, не большая авария, выключился сверх. Мы сюда положили в наш фарш с кабачками, с луком, с зеленью, уже соль, перец. Добавляем приправу для фальша. Наши мясо обжарилось до нужной консистенции. Сейчас мы будем заполнять наши стаканчики. Как мы это делаем? Открываем стаканчик, берем ложечку. так же засолим ее внутрь и до заполняем наш стаканчик до самого верха. Заполненный стаканчик закрываем крышкой. Итак, все стаканчики. Стаканчики готовы. Я забыла сказать, что я предварительно посуду, в которой я их выкладывала, смазала маслом. Сейчас все это делаем от продукта в душе, мы чуть-чуть присолим их, потому что наши крышечки не соленые. Ну что, наши кабачки провели в духовке 50 минут. В конце за 3 минуты до того, как я их достала, я сверху положила небольшие квадратики сыра, чтобы стаканчики сверху запечатались. И сейчас я покажу, что у нас получилось на выходе. Вот так вот это выглядит. Дела небольшой салатика, составшийся моцареллой, помидорками, зеленью и оливковым маслом. И вот такие симпатичные столбики у нас стоят рядом. Приятного аппетита!","Good day! Let's start! Today we will cook pork zucchini. Surprise from mozzarella inside. We will be minced meat with garlic. I have 5 small zucchini that I have already washed and cleaned. I have garlic. I have such a garlic. Well, it's probably 2 cloves of garlic. Petrushka. In principle, you can use any herbs for minced meat usually better than Kinza. But Kinza I did not find. 500 grams of meat. These are the cups of 5 small tzukis. We will bake in the oven at a temperature of 180 degrees for 30-40 minutes. We fry the minced meat a little. We cut off the lid. The lid remains the same. We made 10 cups of tea and now we will make a minced meat. For this, I will chop one medium onion, two cloves of garlic, half a bunch of parsley and add half the filling that we got in the process of cleaning our ingredients. add the seasoning to the pasha, mix everything with hands. Our meat fried to the desired consistency. Now we will fill our cups. How we do it? Open the glass. Take a spoon. We put it inside and fill our cup to the very top. We close the cup with a lid. So, all the cups are ready. I forgot to say that I was pre-salted the dishes that I put them with oil. Now we will add a little salt to the bottom of the pan. Our zucchini was cooked in the oven for 50 minutes. In the end, 3 minutes before the cooking, I put cheese on top, so that the cups are covered with cheese. And now I will show you what we have. This is how it looks. I made a small salad with the remaining mozzarella, tomatoes, greens and olive oil. And such cute columns are standing next to us. Bon appetit!"

Wydarzeniom, które rozebrają się w tym miejscu, gdzie obecnie zgromadziliśmy się. Nie znajduję właściwych słów, aby godnie wyrazić mój głębokiej szacunek dla waszej postawy wtedy 70 lat temu, kiedy swoją Młodość i to co każdy z nas ma najcenniejsze swoje życie wystawiliście na najwyższe zagrożenie w imię obrony wolności naszej Ojczyzny, ale też w obronie naszych rodaków, przemiężonych przez niemieckich najeźdźców.

Wychowanie przez historii historię kształtowanie patwiotycznych postaw na biografiach narodowych bohaterów, którzy często żyli i działali gdzieś daleko jest bardzo ważna. Ale bardzo ważne jest to, abyśmy utrwalali pamięć o naszych lokalnych bohaterach, o których nie zawsze się pamięta. Jest to szczególnie ważne teraz, kiedy tak właściwie nie wiemy dlaczego. Tak znacznie ogranicza się lekcje nauki historii w polskich szkołach. Nie myślę, że chodzi tylko o w niecości finansowe.

I think that among the young people who came here today, she will remain in memory forever. The history of the design of patriotic attitudes on the biographies of national heroes who often lived and worked somewhere far away is very important. But it is very important to remember our local heroes, about whom you do not always remember. It is especially important now, when we do not know why, so much is limited to the lessons of history in Polish schools. I do not think that it is only about I hope that today's reconstruction will have its positive and sustainable sound in the Mielec community. Let's honor our heroes. Let's erase them from memory.

Questo deriva questo utilizzo a volte a critico, parlo degli analisti, perché poi il giornalista chiaramente è un professionista che spesso legge l'agenzia appena arrivate, l'agenzia parla in inglese a volte. Però per quanto riguarda noi analisti c'è a volte un po' troppa sudditanza intellettuale nei confronti del mondo anglosassone, solo perché è una cosa inglese, si pensa che sia intelligente. Infatti basta vedere cosa hanno che ha combinato gli anglosassoni e tutti quelli che li hanno imitati criticamente durante l'ultima crisi finanziaria. Quindi, come dice giustamente lei, noi italiani abbiamo una lingua che, per quanto riguardi vocaboli, è quasi certamente superiore addirittura l'inglese, ma purtroppo che comandano anche in termini di linguaggio, sono gli inglesi americani. Quali inglesi americani poi a loro volta sono molto bravi nel creare nuove parole inglese? Quindi ogni tanto c'è anche la difficoltà di e corre il nuovo inglese finanziario. Prendono a creare acronimi... Acronimi nuovi, cosa che anche questa cosa di pigs, no, dei maiali per dire i paesi con il maggior debito pubblico. O i brick. O i brick esatto per quanto riguarda i paesi emergenti, pseudo emergenti. Quindi da parte nostra sicuramente è un giusto monito da parte sua e di tutti quelli che ogni tanto ci richiameranno all'ordine. Tenga presente che per altro questa tendenza a rifugiarsi nell'inglese quasi per la voglia e la sicurezza di dare una definizione più precisa per altri un vizio che hanno molti dirigenti d'azienda, specie quando lavorano per delle società multinazionali o comunque molto orientati al mondo anglosassone, anche tra di loro per dirsi le cose di tutti i giorni utilizzano termini inglesi. Quindi sicuramente questo è un uso che non si può evitare, ma giustamente colgo la sua richiesta da parte nostra che sappiamo cosa vogliono dire certi termini, dovremmo avere in mente il fatto che una spiegazione in più nell'incertezza non guaste. e mi fa piacere il suo complimento non tanto nei miei confronti ma nei confronti dell'analisi indipendente quindi l'analisi non bancaria che è la vera analisi poi, grazie. Dunque ci dica qual è la sua domanda? Dovendo fare un investimento in Fiat? Sì. Che dubbia! Volevo sapere un consiglio del tutto al massimo. Quindi la intende entrare in Fiat, va benissimo, la ringraziamo. Se uno poteva entrare sempre in fiat tramite dei cover warrants, dopo lo spin off come veniva fatto il trattamento? Perfetto, va benissimo. Massimo io ti dico subito la domanda, entrare in fiat e come? proprio per discorsi legati e derivati e anche comunque la giusta ripartizione ci saranno dei coefficienti di scopro ufficiali e quindi ci saranno dei numeri che d'accordo o non d'accordo serviranno e saranno certi per dire della vecchia fiat il 60% del valore l'industrial il 40% sarà l'auto questo anche per rettificare poi prezzi fiscali no perché per l'imposta sul capitale game quindi da questo punto di vista ci saranno prima dei 9,29 euro. io sono entrato lungo sul Futur's Scadenza di Cembre, 20.000 a 4.80, vorrei avere una previsione, se possibile, ma non per le taglie che si scende a 20.000 e ci sarà debolezza, se sarà a 21.000 ci sarà forza. Piena solidarietà la prima telefonata ricevuta. Di segua intervisione, ripiri in grazia. Per quanto riguarda Canfin, la fase laterale, un segnale realzista, arrivarebbe sopra i 38 centesimi, questo per quanto riguarda l'analisi tecnica di breve. Nel medio periodo, per quanto riguarda gli ultimi mesi, vediamo un grafico interessante, anche perché abbiamo visto un andamento forte di Pirelli. Questo sicuramente ha contato. Pirelli lo ripeto ancora una volta con l'investimento di fornitura degli pneumatici per la Formula 1, quasi decuplicato la sua visibilità in termini di pubblicità legata agli eventi sportivi. Si parla di 2 miliardi di persone che sono esposte al Marchio Pirelli. Non è una cosa da poco. Signale di debolezza su Campfini invece in caso di discesa sotto i 35 centesimi.","You have always found technical analysis in the company of Massimo Intropido, of Cafinanza. So, just before the publication, this speech on English, in the financial language, what can you say? I said before the break, I absolutely agree with the fact that the transmission of the return to the public is necessary and necessary from our point of view to explain what we are talking about and what exactly that term means. This is a critical point of view. and all those who have imitated them critically during the last financial crisis. So, as she rightly says, we Italians have a language that, as regards the vocabulary, is almost certainly superior to even English, but unfortunately they also command in terms of language are the American English. What American English then, at times, are very good at creating new English words. So sometimes there is also the difficulty of reading English, to run the new financial English. They have to create new acronyms. New acronyms? Also this thing about pigs, no, mails, to say, in the countries with the highest public debt. Or brick. Or brick, exactly, regarding emerging countries, emerging pseudo-emergent. So, on our part, it is certainly a fair but unique measure, on its part, and of all those who will call us back to the order. Keep in mind that, on the other hand, this tendency to refuge in English For the sake of the security of giving a more precise definition, for other than a vice, which many business leaders, especially when they work for multinational companies, or very oriented in the English world, also among them, to say the things they use every day in English terms. So, surely this is a use that cannot be avoided, but precisely, I take the request from our side, which we know what certain terms mean, we should have in mind and we are with Mr Aldo Dacuneo, welcome to the technical analysis. Can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you. Welcome. Good morning. I would like to ask Dr. Massimo. Please. I would like to ask Dr. Massimo. Please. As an analyst, I am an independent analyst and I am one of the best people to see the circulation. Thank you and I'm pleased with your compliment not so much in my confrontations but in the face of the independent analysis, therefore the non-bankage analysis, which is the real analysis then. Thank you. So, what is your question? I wanted to ask, should I make a investment in Fiat? Yes. What a doubt! I wanted to know a piece of advice from the top. So you intend to enter Fiat, that's great. We thank you. I wanted to ask again, If one could always enter Fiat through the cover warrants, how would the spin-off be done? The right distribution will be efficient and efficient. the official numbers will be there. Then, there will always be someone who will have to say it again, but there will be certainty. Regarding the investment, I would say Fiat, I say that on the weakness is one of the few titles that crisis or not crisis, perhaps it is worth it to risk buying. Naturally, when you buy a title on the weakness, if on the one hand it is a good deal, especially then if after the stock exchange, at the same time, but you need to make The technical analysis says that the trend is never going to fight. So, in addition to the technical analysis rule, we need to do it with initially partial capital imports, compared to the amount that we want to invest. Then, with these imports, we manage the profit or loss, giving ourselves a bit of a stop-loss level, a strategic point of view, so a bit of a broad level, which in the case of Fiat, despite the current prices, We are in line with Mr Giancarlo D'Atorino. Welcome. Good morning. What is your question? I have two questions to answer. The first one is about the campsites. First, they don't have any technical equipment on this title. Second, they don't have any equipment on this title. I joined the Futures Scadenza in December 2018. I want to have a prediction if possible. If we send 20,000, there will be weakness. If it is 21,000, there will be strength. Full solidarity, the first phone call received. The following interview, thank you. We thank you. We will answer your questions immediately. So, as far as the campaign is concerned, the lateral phase, the rise signal, sorry, would come above 38th century, this is as far as the technical analysis is concerned. In the middle of the period, as far as the last months are concerned, however, we see an interesting graph, also because we have seen a strong trend of Pirelli. So this has certainly counted. Pirelli, I repeat it once again, with the supply investment of the Pneumatici for Formula 1, He almost decoupled his visibility in terms of advertising related to sporting events. He talks about 2 billion people who are exposed to the Pirelli brand. It's not a small number. A sign of weakness on the pitch, but in case of a descent below 35 cent. And we'll stop for a few moments, soon."

Introduction to Japanese pronunciation 5. Double consonant pronunciation. Quite often in Japanese you will come across many words that have double consonants in 農間 or have the small 嗤 in Hiragana or Katakana. These double consonants are normally made up of kana from these lines and usually follow a vowel. Example 一生. Saying these types of words requires a slight pause and jump to get the correct pronunciation. Some business Japanese textbooks use a hyphen between the double consonants as an aid in pronouncing these types of words. Examples 三日 真っすぐ やった 失敗 バグ ベッド 詳 You will often see words with double N or double I. These kinds of words do not follow this double consonant rule. The main reason being is that they do not use the small hiragana or katakana tsu in their spelling. This concludes the basic rules of Japanese pronunciation. But there are more rules for Japanese pronunciation that we are not going to cover such as accent, intonation, blended sounds, lengthened sounds, etc. It is important to let you know know these rules do exist but also that you can naturally get a feel for many of these sounds as you progress in learning the language. So finally I'd like to say, Ganbatte kudasai.","Welcome to show you Japanese. Introduction to Japanese pronunciation 5. Double consonant pronunciation.

I was just talking to Sarah Chalk off the air, but now we're on the air. I was just Sarah and I were talking about the episode of Scrubs where she uses the toilet on the roof. And you were talking about how excited you were to work with Michael J. Fox? Yeah, I love that Michael Jay Fox just I read a quote from him yesterday where somebody asked you know what kind of roles he can play on TV and he said I can play any role as long as they have my disease He's like as long as they have Parkinson's I can do any role ever as long as it's a guy with Parkinson's so what he has done for Parkinson's disease. I mean, it's just he's changing the face of the disease. He's fundraised so much for it. disorders, you know, awareness, your son had Kawasaki disease and that's something that just came up on Grey's Anatomy recently. needed to find a way to raise awareness on a big scale. And someone said, what about doing an episode on a medical show? Because symptoms are very visual. We thought parents at home could see what that looks like, that they ever came across it. Maybe it would trigger for them. And basically there was a website, kdfoundation.org, that saved my son. I would just go to it every day and it lists all the symptoms so clearly. It had all of them. And being sent home, like it's not Kawasaki disease. And this website kind of gave me the confidence to keep pushing to see a specialist. And you have a 10 day window to get a treatment Wow. your body and one of the last symptoms is the finger skin peels away. But that often happens with a 10 day window. So if you see your kid having any other symptoms, just go see a specialist. And the other weird thing is take pictures of your kid when they're sick. And I know that sounds so strange to do when they're sick and you're taking a picture of their rash, but that's what ended up diagnosing my son because by the time we made it to the specialist, some of the symptoms were gone. And it was the pictures of him at his sickest that the doctor used to diagnose him. He said, Oh, that's so awesome. What a cool thing. I mean, just for so many people, I'm sure, you know, thousands of people listening right now probably, like me, might not have ever heard of the disease or if they did, had no idea what it is. And now parents know that, you know, if there's something really off with your child that sounds like that, you know, they at least will, in the back of their mind will go, maybe it's Kawasaki disease and look it up and see if, you know, the symptoms match up. I mean, what great awareness you're bringing to this. website, KDFoundation. I think they usually get 200 visitors a day and then they got 30,000 a day of grace. So they emailed me to say like, I'm sure there are parents already who are figuring it out from this, from this. And that was our goal. We thought like if we can just help one parent not go through what we did then worth it. That's awesome. What a great, great use of your voice there to be able to spread awareness for that. And now let's spread awareness to something that's paying those bills. How to live with your parents for the rest of your life. Your new show with you, the very funny and the ever so lovely and talented Elizabeth Perkins. They play your parents and you play the what seems to be somewhat dysfunctional daughter, Polly, and your daughter and you move back into the house, right? Can you not say this line or just don't look at me on this one line because I can't get through it? It was ridiculous. It was ridiculous. If you're sitting there having a laughing attack thinking, I need a producer to come and like glare at me or do something to make me feel like I can't stop laughing. you like wondering you know because these new shows you never know they they could be the biggest show in the world or they can't even they could get canceled in one season luckily it looks like this one's gonna you know have some legs but is there a pressure do you feel that pressure is it just something that you know the media worries about and you don't even think about I think it's less of a pressure than just like a wish for it to go on in the sense that I just want to get to hang out with these people longer because it's the funnest job I think you know with scrubs we got so lucky I mean it gets lightning in a bottle to get to be on one show for that long and and i think in terms of the next job you have to go with your gut in terms of what makes you laugh and when i read this pilot i use it making me laugh out loud and love the jokes i mean i i couldn't believe how it raises and funny the parents were i love the character i could relate to her so much and i think you just you gotta go with with what makes you laugh and what's funny and then get to hope that you get to do it for a bit of time that's awesome anything else that you're working on aside from how to live with your parents is this all you're doing right now do you have any other projects in the hopper That's good. Do you got a focus that's what Elizabeth said to everybody's just focused on this show and That's good. I mean a lot of times people have too many things going on I like that you all quit everything in your lives except this show Totally I've moved in with Claudia and her parents Rather moving in like we're just thinking maybe if we just you know really are method about it That it'll yeah that it'll really that'll come across to the audience and it can't can't fail Well, it's everything seems to be going well for the show I mean for the show so far obviously with those ratings The reviewers are loving it people in the audience We've had people you know here in on our text line text and and say how funny the show is already So if you haven't checked it out yet make sure to check it out how to live with your parents for the rest of your life Elizabeth Perkins who was Celia on weeds. She's fantastic Brad Garrett obviously we know from everybody loves Raymond and of course Sarah we know from scrubs and everything else she's done fantastic cast great premise, very topical and hard hitting with what's happening in today's economy. So it's kind of a funny twist on things that's happening to people all over the country. So check the show out and enjoy it and remember Kawasaki disease. Spread the word about that. And Sarah, thank you so much for giving that disease a voice for your awareness, for being so cool and for taking the time for us this morning. Thank you so much for having me. All right, bye-bye.

Let me step back to show you. This is also in size 22 US. I'm going to show you this dress. This is 22 but it was just a little too tight. So most likely I'm going to give these dresses away.

Ik wil dat je voor het volgende spel een indeling maakt van Zodana Gdatter. Drie projectontwikker aankomen, drie bouwbedrijven, drie transporteurs en twee vakbonden. Zoals je kunt zien, dit is de mogelijkheden die ze kunnen doen. Ze kunnen bijvoorbeeld ook als er een van de laatste twee gaan, kunnen ze de vakbonden volledig buiten spel zetten. ...want het vervelen is waar minder in totaal was. Maar dan zorgen ze er ook voor dat de vakbond er niks krijgt. Voor het volgende spel gaan wij dienen bouwen. Ja, daar ben ik echt best goed in. Helaas alleen cruciaal. We zijn allemaal door de koning ingedeeld in de rol van... Wat zijn de projectontwikkelaars?

We willen geen even. We stemmen je afstract. Als we doen een dringel, dan maakt het niet meer uit voor onze meerderheid. Nee, precies die hebben we toch niet. Dus we kunnen volgens mij beter zorgen dat zij ons zo min mogen als een bedreiging zijn. Net als het 555-partie-prop zit open hier. Wat punt heb je? Ja maar, net als het totale punt aantallen. We gaan niet uit hoeveel punten we hebben. We hebben heel erg lang filmen. We moeten Elst mee gaan. Wil we Elst plia stemmen? Ik wil steindel met jouw stemmen. Ik weet niet natuurlijk. Ik denk echt dat we alle vrienden kunnen vertrouwen. Steindel met mijn stemmen maar Elst... Elst... punt is dat Elst vertrouwt mij gewoon echt niet. Nee. Oké. Zo wel eens dumpen. Waarom ben je dat? Waarom ben je dat? Waarom had je Niels eruit? Dat was verstandig zo. Oké. Ja, mij daar uit hadden was niet verstandig. Sorry Niels. No, Rene. Wat is de volgende actie? Ik ben er niet direct in het rest in. Morgen aan het eind van de dag wil ik wat koning worden. Dat is een hele goede reden daarvoor. We zijn gegaan in 60% van het land. Wat zou je voortaan? Ja, de ene afzet als klän of meer. Dat is het enige wat we kunnen doen. Daarom is het een beduit in ons klän. Maar wat er daar aan wie we hem dan moeten geven, dat weet ik niet. Want persoonlijk of ik hem niet te nodig te hebben. Als je morgen zo vrij de lichaam uitgaat, dan blijf je er nu in en je gaat er maar zo vrij uit. En morgen puntenprijt, en vandaag puntenprijt. Als team. Ja, dat is zo. En dus? Nou, dat is alle... Ja, dat was als tien voor het kind aan dat we het hebben om Lamersche gedingen aan ons toe te trekken in als koning of zo. Dus moet ik eruit? Nee, niet parzé. Nou ja, het kan wel hoor, als het beter is. Ik vind hier... Het argument is dat is een reed om jou daaruit te zetten, want anders zijn we tenzij, Lamersche, we morgen, voordat jij weggaat, Lamersche ook nog een keer een eliminatie hebben waarbij wij verplicht, iemand van ons de eigen bedoeling moet zetten, is Trance Gust. Maar weet je nu zeker dat... Je mag je ook niet opvassen aan te spuiten. Ik snap het niet meer. Wat is het? van huiselijke onvreden heeft een beslissing genomen. Het spel gaat verder zonder Els.","For the next game I want to talk to the king. I want you to make an episode of Sodana Gdatter. Three project developers, three construction companies, three transporters and two wagons. As you can see, these are the possibilities they can do. They can also, if they go one of the last two, they can put the wagons completely out of the game. We are all part of the project development, construction company, transporter or wakebond. The project developers have the best cards and the worst cards. Each player can participate in the construction of a project. There are four projects, one to four. If you need one for a project, for example, a project 1, a construction company, a transporter and a farm, those people must then see 60 points below the link to share. Project 3, for example, only has a project developer and a construction company. You can divide 45 points by the number of points. And there are also specifications for project 2 and project 4. The specifications are down here. So that you can put something in it. You can only do one thing. You can only do one thing. But you have to build a two-bedroom building. You are a translator. You have to build one side two-bedroom. Yes, you can build it. I want to win, otherwise I will just go in. 20 is less than we normally get. We get 24 and 22, so I think we all have to use 24. We want to go to the next round. Can I take one more? No, one more. Up to 10 over 10 is the free space. And then it's 8. And 10 over 10, we will get one more clan. And that's why one person will leave the game. We're not going to make it anymore for our majority. We don't have it. We can make sure that they don't harm us as much as possible. Just like the 555, the cops are over here. What's the point? Just like the total point. We're not going to get out of the cops. We're going to film for a long time. Do we have to go with the cops? Do we want to vote for the cops? I want to vote for you. I think I can trust you. I think you can trust me. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. I don't trust you.

I don't trust you No, I don't know yet. I don't understand why you still don't understand it if you throw a nail in the hole. But that's a whole lot of points. I want to give you a good reason. Why do you want to divide? Why don't you tell me why you threw a nail in the hole? Because there is a certain animal in the hole. With whom? With whom? With the cat. You don't have to fear anything. We're 60% done. What would you prefer? I'd prefer to wear a dress, but that's the only thing we can do. With a dress outside in our dress. But I don't know what to do with it. Because I personally don't need it. If you're going to leave tomorrow, you're going to stay there. You're going to leave tomorrow and today. As a team. That's it. Well, that's all. That's what we're doing as a team. We're doing it to attract things to us. So we have to go out? No, not Parzay. Well, it can be. If it's better, I think so. The argument is that's a reason to put you out there. Otherwise we'll say, let's say we're leaving tomorrow, and we'll have an elimination. But we have to get someone out of our own. Is there a chance? But are you sure that... I can also split it up, that's fun. Because you have the day you go to the beach tomorrow morning. But then you can split it up again. Yes, but then I'm in a good position to do it last month. You can also split it up. Maybe if I do it first. I'm so sorry that I didn't do it last night. You're Team Klaas. What's your idea? How do you know that name? Team Klaas, I know that name. I know that name. But you don't have a real name. But you can't tell us. You can tell us. I'm a bit jealous in the tent. Gunther is one of the original members of Team Huizenlijk. Which clan should you choose? It's still a domestic event. What it's like now. The king has decided that someone will leave and be unhappy. What should it be? It's 11. The home team decided to play without Elst. We're out. They've backed me up because I had too many points. That's a bit of a shame. I couldn't do much. I had to go to another team. But I'm talking about 8 days."

How do you stop your partner from being jealous? my whole Take on the situation is You guys jealousy does not happen overnight Jealousy is not something that you go to bed with when you go to bed and you wake up and all of a sudden you're jealous That is not how it happens ladies gentlemen ladies gentle studs or whatever you know Jealousy starts from the gate. It's kind of like a bad as 10 year old You know they don't go to bed at 9 wake up at on their 10th birthday and they're just hell on wheels It doesn't happen that way. It's something that is learned and through it being accepted by so many people It's just who they are If you are a jealous person my thing is You need to check yourself because personally I feel like if you're a jealous person You have your own Closet you have your own skeletons in a closet that you don't want nobody to know about you know I'm saying so you need to check yourself make sure you don't have anything to call someone else to be jealous about and then you know you might Not need to be jealous about anything else You know kind of kind of how like you know a cheater wants the cheater, you know gets caught or whatever and then they Switching around and try to catch their other person cheating always think that the other person is cheating have a guilty conscience and shit contents and shit, you know If you are dealing with like a jealous meet a jealous person my whole thing is Don't set yourself up for failure Like I said before if you know that this person is jealous They've been jealous from the beginning they've been jealous before you met them stop thinking that it's cute Stop thinking that when you first meet them and they call the answer that is them doing some real stalker-esque type shit and you know if I were you I'd let that shit go but um you know on a another level my take on the situation is especially if you are in a relationship like myself I'm in a committed relationship I'm extremely happy in my relationship my girlfriend is happy extremely happy in our relationship why because there is no secret There's no stone unturned. or you answer your phone and you're taking another room or what else what's another good one or Everybody is just a friend. I mean, you know, come on. It's only so many friends a person can have when in a relationship and Take my advice your mate should know all of your friends All of your friends there should not be a friend that your girlfriend boyfriend husband spouse whatever does not know about period point blank. That's how you keep down confusion and dumb shit. I'm just putting it out there. If you have a friend, think about it. Go through all your friends in your head. Run a list of all your friends right now. And I'm talking to you folks in a relationship. Run through all your friends. And if you have friends that you really, really consider your friend, does your mate know about them? And if they do, that's good. If they don't, you might want to reevaluate That friend why does your mate not know about that friend or why does your mate not like that friend? But jumping back on the actual topic or whatever jealousy is not good people need to nip that shouldn't but If you are jealous person check yourself if you date in a jealous person fuck check yourself because if you keep putting up with it Then fuck they gonna keep doing this shit. You know what I'm saying if you keep uh Excuse me. You keep allowing this shit. Hey, why not? You know me?

Pastore ! Salut à tous, oui c'est moi Pastore. Et comme vous l'avez dit Yervine, on se retrouve pour une nouvelle vidéo qui est un top 10 kill sniper sur MW3. Et oui, on attaque tout de suite par la deuxième place qui est postée par Mathis Eric qui est sur Fallen avec le barrette et qui va faire une balle boom de kill dans Headshot. Très bien, on enchaîne avec la neuvième place Avec un Amia, Irwin et moi Terminateur du 26 qui va en tuer un Il aura un outil de l'outil et encore un Et voilà, là maintenant on fait la huitième place qui est occupée par Aya Dams qu'on va retrouver plusieurs fois sur la vidéo qui a fait très beau clip Et là il est choisi de pacifier un kill Il a vendu un tunnel, un deuxième kill là il les enchaîne, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, un trip et tout ça en Kilkarm Et maintenant on va revoir la Kilkarm Très beau clip Oui vraiment, beau clip On voit qu'il enchu un, un deuxième, c'est quand même un bon mystérieuse. Donc voilà, on va voir qui est le cas. Et maintenant la 6e place, ça est occupé par Scud, par HDNM6, pardon. On est à la cinquième place au Ronde dans le top 5 avec... ...Squidarks qui se retrouve en Outpost. Il fait un kill, deux kills, trois kills, une triple élimination et encore un C la Quad-Feed. Super. Et maintenant la quatrième place qui est occupée par I Adams, je vous l'avais dit on allait retrouver deux fois. Et maintenant il choira ma Fallen, il s'avance, il envoie un kill, deux kills, trois kills, il voit quatrième, il le rate et là il quatre. Et tout ça, bravo à lui. Mais malheureusement, il ne fait pas un kill. Troisième place au Ronde dans le top 5. Et voilà maintenant la deuxième place. On retrouve Taparco qui est sur la map Arcade avec son R6. Il joue en silencieux, normal c'est pas facile. Il en revient, il en tue 2. Il se retourne, il entend, il voit des numes sur le radar et là il va faire un carnage. Regardez, regardez, regardez la barre des filles en vain. C'est augmente facile. Est-ce que ça avec le silence, hein, R.S.A.S. ? Bravo. Et voilà, c'est la fin de la vidéo mais juste avant on aimerait passer quelques dédicaces à des gens qui sont là depuis le début qui nous soutiennent des amis à nous sur le PSN. On commence tout de suite par Terminator du 26, un ami à Pastoré et un moi qu'on remercie vraiment parce qu'il fait de beaux clips aussi donc il a participé dans ce top de skill. Il est arrivé 9ème je crois, bravo à lui. Et maintenant, 13940, un très grand ami à pastorer à moi sur le PSN. On le remercie vraiment, c'est l'un de nos plus anciens abonnés, merci à lui. Il nous donne plein d'idées et comment faire et tout ça. Merci, on joue souvent avec lui, c'est un très bon ami. Et moi je voudrais remercier Xtreme Rider, car c'est lui qui nous donne des idées pour les vidéos comme le Top 5 Fail, qui sera une de prochaines vidéos et de cette vidéo. Merci à lui. Et bien sûr un grand remerciement comme Foy. et voilà c'est la fin de la vidéo n'hésitez pas à la commenter parce qu'on regarde et on répond à tous vos commentaires n'hésitez pas à la partager à vous abonner et à l'aimer ciao bye tout le monde","See you in the next video on the official fun play, which will be a top 10 kills commented by me and... Pastore! Hello everyone, it's me Pastore. And as you can see, we meet again for a new video, which is a top 10 sniper kills on MW3. And yes, we are attacking right away by the second place, which is posted by Mathis Eric, who is on Fallen with the Barrette and who will make a BOOM of kills in Headshot! Very good! We continue with the ninth place! with a Namia, he comes back and me, Terminator 26 who kills one, he takes our kill and kills one more. And now we have the 8th place occupied by AyaDams, who we will find several times in the video, who made a very nice clip and now he has chosen to pacify one kill. He has sold a tunnel, a second kill, there he continues them, a triple and all that, in a few frames. And now we will see the other one again. Very nice clip. Yes really nice clip. We see that he is one, a second one, a good destroyer. So we'll see who it is. And without further ado, we continue to the seventh place occupied by Boom Gamer, which is in the mission map. And he will enchant 5 titans with his sniper, so he advances. He takes a turn, he accelerates, he advances, he turns right, And now the 6th place, he is occupied by... And now the 5th place goes to the top 5 with Skull Darks who is in Outpost. He kills 3 kills, triple elimination and again, it's the Quatrid. Great. And now the 4th place occupied by Aya Dams. I told you we found her twice. And now she's playing a map Fallen. He advances, he sends 1 kill, 2 kills, 3 kills. He sees 4th, he misses it and there he kills. And all that, well done to him. But unfortunately he doesn't do a Quatrid. In the podgeom, we find 4 BL who is in the lockdown map. He is aiming, he is looking for someone, he is looking for the triple, he is looking for someone and he kills the quadri. So we see the second place, we find Taparco who is in the parka with his R6. He is playing in a normal situation, it's not easy. He is looking for 2. He turns around and he sees the others on the radar and there he will do a carnage. Look at the girl's beard. It's an easy increase. Is that with the science? And finally the winner of this top 10, which is modern for 3 snipers. On the highest step of the podium, she wins this 91st in village. He goes 1, 1 second, 1 third, 1 fourth, he does the quad film but he does not stop. It's a 6th, but it's a 6th speed, and look if there's anyone. And it's 11 in 10. And a 7th, which you might think deserves the first place of this Top 10 Kill. Well played. And that's it, it's the end of the video, but just before we would like to give some dedication to the people who have supported us since the beginning, friends of ours on the PSN. We start right away by Terminator, 26, a friend of mine who has not been stolen, and we really thank him because he makes beautiful clips, so he participated in this Top 10 Kill. He arrived 9th, I think, well done to him. And now, 13,940, a very big friend, a pastor, and me on the PSN, we really thank him, he's one of the oldest subscribers, thank him. He gives us a lot of ideas on how to do it and all that. Thank you and we play often with him. He's a very good friend. And I would like to thank Extreme Rider, because he gives us ideas for videos like the Top 5 Fails, which will be one of the next videos and this video. Thank him. And of course, a big thank you again, and thank you all for all the subscribers you are 34 today we thank you infinitely as well as for 600 views soon and that's it, it's the end of the video, do not hesitate to comment because we watch and we answer all your comments do not hesitate to share it to your subscribers and to like it.

Così per il secondo anno consecutivo è nata la settimana della prevenzione a piazza del plebiscito. Numerosi stand, ognuno gestito da uno specialista differente che informeranno i cittadini su come curarsi adeguatamente. di riconoscenza e avvicinamento alla cultura della prevenzione per l'agente comune. Tante le associazioni che sono in piazza oggi diverse, le istituzioni, i medici, tanti gli incontri in agenda per avvicinare i ragazzi alla cultura della prevenzione, tutti insieme con un unico scopo, cioè aiutare e far conoscere la prevenzione all'agente comune. maratona internazionale di Napoli che si svolgerà domenica prossima. Una scelta obbligata perché come sottolinea il Professor Pagano, sport alimentazione equilibrata e vita sana, sono i tre presupposti di una vita migliore. l'agenzia di Napoli Piñatelli che riuscita a coinvolgere tanti medici e tante specialisti, tanti specialisti che gratuitamente vengono a portare a loro opera. La salute è importante per l'attività sportiva. La salute aiuta a poter non dover ricorrere i medici per poter stare in buona salute. Quali sono le patologie che più di frequente vengono trascurate e che invece andrebbero correttamente prevenute? Ma il problema non è veneno trascurato, il problema è che purtroppo molto spesso per poter fare una vista specialistica bisogna per notarsi tre, quattro, cinque mesi prima a secondo delle patologie per poter avere una diagnosi, un'acceptimento e una diagnosi. Nel villaggio questi tempi sono completamente abattuti, riescono ad avere l'immediato risponso a parte fatto la visita immediata.","Tumors, bone problems, respiratory problems and much more. Italians today are subject to different pathologies that often do not even know what to do. That is why the medical departments of the Nopay are out in the square, with the aim of helping in the diagnosis. So for the second consecutive year the prevention week has come to the square of the plebiscite. Numerous stands, each one managed by a different specialist who will inform the citizens on how to take care of themselves. The initiative is the area of the 12th a national marathon of Naples that will take place next Sunday. A choice that is obligated because, as underline by Professor Pagano, sports healthy and balanced food are the three assumptions of a better life. For us, one of the many things that seem to please have been instituted, and it becomes a flower in the eye. It was really an idea, it came last year, and brilliantly then it was developed by the GD the NAPOLI Pignatelli Agency, which has managed to involve many doctors and specialists who are gradually bringing their work. Health is important for sports activities. It helps health to avoid having to go back to the doctors to be healthy. What are the most common pathologies that would be perfectly predicted? The problem is not that they are being transferred, the problem is that unfortunately, very often, to be able to have a specialist visa, you need to be able to have a diagnosis, 5 months before, according to the pathologies, to be able to have a diagnosis, certainly a diagnosis. In the village these times are completely canceled, they can have immediate response, aside from the immediate visa."

La calidad del agua influye muchísimo, supongo que igual pasan al café. La calidad del agua que tenga produce un tipo de sal, un tipo de agua que se puede usar para la comida. y luego la diferencia por ejemplo a nivel industrial, a nivel más industrializado, más artesanal es que la cerveza artesana realmente cuida que sean estos cuatro ingredientes los que se mantengan como básicos y a diferencia de eso las industrias incorporan a veces maíz o arroz para baratar el costo en el proceso de producción y generan un producto distinto entonces a nivel artesanal sí que ellos colocan cada uno de los ingredientes que tiene su cerveza. La cerveza es una de las diferentes variedades de cervezas en la parada. Pero lo curioso es que en cada una de las comarcas ya prácticamente podríamos ir a degustar la cerveza local. Coza que pasa en Bélfica y que aquí de momento están pesando. Hay un movimiento importante en el mundo de la cervecería artesana. Lo que es más importante es el agua, la calidad del agua donde proceda. Hay cervezas, no sé por ejemplo, ¿no? Te cuento. La cerveza del Monsein es una cerveza que justamente las cosas que resaltan en sus elaboraciones que el agua procede del Monsayn, de manantiales de agua naturales. Entonces claro, al final este tipo utilizan un agua de calidad y así cada una va utilizando un poco las particularidades de su zona. Estoy viendo que hay mucha sinergia entre la cerveza y el café. ¿Hay cervezas con café? Hay cervezas de fermentación espontánea que se hacen específicamente añadiendo otros ingredientes. y normalmente las más comunes, las más conocidas son las de frutas todos hemos probado alguna de cereza o de fresa o de melocotón, son las más conocidas belgas pero luego también hay varios tipos de cerveza que se hacen con café, con trazas de café entonces incorporan en la elaboración el tostado, el grano del café tostado porque el tostado del café Como me imagino que con la cerveza es parecido, pero nos da una parte del amargor del café. Por ejemplo, en el café, cuanto más tueste al grano, más amargo va a ser también. Y sí que es cierto que el tostado de la malta también puede otorgar algún tipo de amargor a la cerveza, un poco más de cuerpo, dependiendo del grado de tostado. Sí, de tostado. Pero concluyo aquí que para degustar una cerveza especial, Necesitas encontrar diferentes tipos de sabores, no solo uno y ya está, pero buscamos sabores especiales. Sabores especiales, sin duda. Para cervezas especiales. Sí, para hacer. Y sobre todo que hayan cuidado en su proceso de elaboración, hayan cuidado todos los pasos. Pues en la cerveza yo creo que también hay que cuidar todo el proceso de elaboración, porque además una cerveza es muy fácilmente contaminable, o si la maquinaria no está limpia, Si el proceso no se realiza correctamente, entonces realmente lo que buscamos en las cervezas artesanas es un producto de calidad, igual que en el café. Incluso por ejemplo, siempre hablo en mis formaciones de que en el café el producto no está hecho, el barista lo está preparando. Por ejemplo, la cerveza, la preparación de la bebida lo hacen dentro de la fábrica, lo hacen expertos, lo hacen controladamente. maestro cervecero como debe ser. Wow, increíble, me has abierto un mundo nuevo de cerveza. Sí, de cerveza. Buen barista. Buen café. Y buena cerveza.","We have arrived at the Galbaigne market and we are with Cristina Perez.

The beer is composed of four basic ingredients, which are malt, yeast, lupus and water. The quality of water influences a lot, I suppose they are the same as coffee. So the quality of water you have produces a kind of and then the difference, for example, at the industrial level, at the more industrialized level, more artisanal, is that the artisanal beer really takes care that these four ingredients are the ones that are maintained as basic. And unlike that, the industries sometimes incorporate corn or rice to lower the cost in the production process and generate a different product. So at the artisanal level, they place the products each of the ingredients that your beer has. This is again a synergy with the coffee issues because special coffees always have a point of where they come from, who they are, when they were toasted, etc. etc. So there are also people who buy coffee who can see the difference. The more specifications you have of your product, logically, the higher quality you can find. At this moment we have around 110 but the curious thing is that in each of the shops we could practically go to taste the local beer, which happens in Belgium and here at the moment it is starting, there is an important movement in the world of artisans beer, what is most important is the water, the quality of the water where it proceeds, there are beers, I don't know for example, I tell you, the Monceil beer is a beer that is precisely one of the The things that highlight in its elaboration is that the water comes from the Montseigne, the ancient hands of natural waters. So, of course, in the end, this type, let's say, uses a quality water and so each one uses a little bit the, well, the particularities of its area. I'm seeing that there is a lot of synergy between beer and coffee. Is there beer with coffee? There are spontaneous fermentation beers that are made specifically by adding other ingredients. and the most commonly known are the fruits. We have all tried some of the cereza, or the fresa, or the melocotón. They are the most well-known. But then there are also several types of beer that are made with coffee, with coffee slices. Then they incorporate in the elaboration the toast, the grain of the toasted coffee. Because the toasted coffee as I imagine with beer it is similar but it gives us a part of the bitterness of the coffee. For example, in the coffee the more you taste the bitterness will also be. And it is true that the toast of the malt can also give some kind of bitterness to the beer a little more body depending on the degree of toast. Yes, of the toast, but I conclude here that to taste a special beer you need to find different types of flavors, not just one, but we are looking for special flavors. Special flavors, no doubt. To make special beers. Yes, to make. And above all, that they have taken care of all the steps in their process of production. Well, in beer, I think that you also have to take care of the whole process of production, because in addition, a beer is very easily contaminated, if the machinery is not clean, if the machinery is not clean, The process is not done correctly. So what we really look for in craft beer is a quality product, just like in coffee. I always talk about the fact that in coffee the product is not made. The barista is preparing it. For example, the beer, the preparation of the drink, they do it inside the factory, they do it expertly, they do it controlled. Master's Cervicero. how it should be. Wow, incredible, you have opened a new world of beer. Yes, beer. Good barista. Good coffee. And good beer."

No one's in his face. sometimes it becomes mental at that point. There is the Marcus Thornton we've been expecting. Jump, half court you can switch and not be penalized. Kyle Gaylord has spinny mood and it's stripped away. Britt and that is now one thousand and one point that rim inside the paint. Marcus Thornton forces Matt Brady into a timeout. We'll see what the Dukes have in store here. Davis turning the corner and powers Here's Nation. A three for Andre Nation. Inside this go to rest over in the skim of touch on the block. That was a quick release three. Then all crosses as you see whatever you see a screen for a ball they're just going to switch. And a backdoor look a perfect feed. Matt Rum finds Marcus Norton. 90 seconds to play first half or back to another time. Davis looking to change that end will with an extra shot coming. There's Ray Sean going setting the screen. You see Devon Moore and his output so far and right off the get-go. Release again by Marcus Thornton. Quick release again on that three on the bench getting a breather. Gaylord, got it! Kyle Gaylord. We've seen this evening. Britt calling for it and buries another three. Or excuse me, imagine this man, Devon Moore. That's a great feed. Moore finding Iliandiyov. André Nation with his four personals in and there's Raysean Goans who's also come in. Two to shoot. Thornton in the air. Goans attacking on Heldring. Two strong Davis with a monster follow. J.M.U. with seven team files. More working on Thornton and the putback by André Nation. Oh what a lucky break. They don't want to file Thornton. He's open for three and misses and here's Ron Curry with a big time rebound. The freshman Ron Curry. Now more than a two possession game. Thornton, no, and into the hands of Curry and JMU moves on to the center. semifinals where they will take on Delaware, Matt Brady, and the third seed in the tournament JMU advances with the final here of 72-67."

Only one tenth of the hair is straight. But it is stronger than the same rough steel silk. The elastic is three times more elastic. This fiber is called the spider silk. Spider silk has a super strong personality. Anyone can think of it. In the laboratory, scientists took out spider silk from the tail of the spider. Test its physical characteristics. The spider silk can be divided into two parts. Alpha is a irregular circuit, like a yellow-tinted, which provides the network to generate the natural elasticity. Beta is a series of circuit, which increases the network's resistance to external force. If we make this mouse into a shape like this, then a mouse like this, theoretically, can block a 77-plane, a 77-plane in flight. You may ask why there are so many advantages of mouse, There are no pig's silk products because the reason for the silk is because the silk is a plant-based product. It can be grown in a small area. The pig can't be. The pig with a plant-based texture is land-based. It can't be bred in a mountain or in a lake. Besides, scientists have a bad understanding of pig's silk. There are too many interesting and complicated parts in the process of pig's silk. We can't understand them. So, in these situations, you are only and show his protein, you can't make him become as strong as a spider. For scientists, spider is the most unimaginable material in the world. The biological scientist wants to further understand its mystery. The chemical scientist wants to combine the same artificial fibers. It seems that the human scientific development is still going on. The great natural restoration of the ghost mansion still makes people forget about it."

Data de los siglos XVI y XVII y tal era su importancia en tiempos pasados que fue visitada por el mismísimo Rey Felipe II. La historia sobre la imagen de la Virgen de Nava Onda hay que buscarla en los tiempos en los que Robledo de Chabela era una población que pertenecía a Segovia. En una ocasión, en un valle llamado de Nava Onda, se encontró una talla de la virgen y que fue ocultada por unos cegobianos para protegerla de la invasión musulmana. Una vez encontrada de nuevo la talla, los cegobianos la reclamaron a los robledanos y cuando estos quisieron llevarla a cegobia, las caballerías que transportaban la talla de la virgen a mitad de camino se negaron a continuar. Por muchos palos que les dieron para que siguieran su camino, al ver que no podían hacer nada a los caballos, se decidió que la imagen se quedara para siempre en aquel lugar. llamado desde entonces el humilladero. Año más tarde se construiría lo que fue la primera ermita un poco más abajo. Son muchos los milagros que se la atribuyen a esta imagen, como los tres hijos que tuvo una mujer considerada estéril durante años. Cada día y sobre todo los finales de semana, son muchos los fieles que se acercan a esta partada ermita para hacer una visita a la Virgen de Nava Onda y solicitar sus bondades.","The Hermita of Nava Onda is located in the municipal term of Robledo de Chabela, specifically in the West-Western Sierra of Madrid. Data from the 16th and 17th centuries and such was its importance in past times that was visited by the very king Philip II. The story about the image of the Virgin of Nava Onda must be looked for in times in which Robledo de Chabela was a population that belonged to Segovia. On one occasion, in a valley called De Nava Onda, found a virgin's size and was hidden by some Segovians to protect it from the Muslim invasion. Once the size was found again, the Segovians claimed it to the Robledans and when these wanted to take it to Segovia, the cavalry that transported the virgin's size halfway refused to continue. For many sticks they gave them to follow their path, when they saw that they could not do anything to the horses, they decided that the image would remain forever in that place. called the Humilladero since then. Years later it would be built, which was the first Hermite a little lower. There are many miracles that are attributed to this image, like the three children that a woman considered sterile had for years. Every day and especially on weekends, there are many faithful people who come to this part of the Hermite to make a visit to the Virgin of Nava Onda and ask for her goodness."

Y lo primero que podíamos ver, lo primero que podíamos ver es que cuando Abraham estaba allí en ese instante, cuando estaba sentado en ese lugar, cuando estaba a punto de sacrificar su hijo y el ángel, lo detuvo, lo primero que pudimos ver dice que él asozo sus ojos y miró atrás y vio un carnero trabado en un zarzalca, trabado entre los árboles, trabado ahí entre los arbustos y dice que tomó aquel carnero, lo colocó en lugar de su hijo y llamó aquel lugar Jehová Proverá.","Tomorrow's blessed is presented by the courtesy of Subway.

And we're going to listen to a song from the Venezuelan generation. And this is called, Yo Soy Generación. Enjoy! Hello, dear TV viewers, I'm Marisa Belgrosso from Renacer Spa. Go back to your seat. and we are talking about Abraham, we are talking about Abraham, we are more exactly Genesis chapter 22 and we are sharing the, when we have fear of God, there in that quote it is recorded that Abraham was going to sacrifice his son, his only son, and he was going to sacrifice him to God, God had asked him to do it, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, and he was going to sacrifice his son, in that moment, it is not that God is looking for us, let's say, to kill or murder our children, but that he simply wanted to observe the fear of Abraham and realized how much his fear was and the benefits that this brought from the power that Abraham had to have fear of God. And the first thing we could see is that when Abraham was there in that moment, when he was sitting in that place, when he was about to write his son and the angel, he stopped him the first thing we could see he says that he raised his eyes and looked back and saw a deer trapped in a sarsalca trapped among the trees trapped there among the bushes and says that he took that deer he placed it instead of his son and called that place a jeovar provera"

Vamos a empezar con mi historia. Yo me hice Atacu hace como 13 años, hace unos como 6 años y tenía 13 años. Empecé leyendo comics en este mundo frikki, empecé con todos los superhéroes de Superman, Batman, la interna verde, todos ellos me encantaban. Me gustaban muchas series comic. De muchas series comic gracias a unos amigos que conocen una tienda de comics. De hecho yo lo tendía. Leí crisis infinita, crisis de identidad, civil war, crisis en las tierras infinitas, este eléfono. ¿Qué otra le hizo por Mansoul? Batman caída del murciélago. Muy buenas series. Pero me aburrieron. y empecé a leer mangas el primer manga que le hizo Ichigo Ichigo 100% es una historia bastante buena gracias a uno de los dos chicos que atendía a uno le encantaban los comics y al otro el manga empecé con esto de que Ichigo me encantó compré los 19 tomos después de comprar todos los 19 tomos de esta serie Ichigo 100% me empecé a interesar más gracias a ellos bueno no necesitaba comprar los mangas para y leí historias como X-Clamp, Subasaur Reserve Chronicles, Koboy Bebop, Chrono Crusades, Ayori Aoshi, Tengyo Tenge, Bleach, Kateki Hitman Reborn, Akuma, Enuyasha, Juyohakusho, son cientos de series que leí durante mi tiempo en esa tienda de comics yendo como visitante. La metálica se entiende y se erró. le extraño para hacer honesto, si esa tienda me trae muy buenos recuerdos cada que paso afuera como que me llegara el nostalgia, pero ya es otra historia, después de eso me empezaba a interesar ver si tenia una animación, estas mismas series y así fue como me adentro en el mundo del anime, empece con Nichigo 100, bueno, yo empece con Evangelion y de ahí se siguieron cientos de series, ahora no Tondashimo ¡Los amantes! ¡Gravitation! ¡Honjo! y el chico kurosaki de bleach, un cosplay bastante bueno y es como que me influyó diciendo pues vámonos todos a la convención disfrazados y así fue como empecé con el cosplay el primer cosplay que se fue el no de alucard que no estuvo tan bueno y no fue uno de rama que es mi cosplay favorito y a la fecha cada que luego me piden muchos fotos me gusta mucho ser cosplay y también el cerotaku me ha ayudado a conocer bastante gente a todos los chicos de aquí a mis amigos de latina de comics a gente que iba inclusive a ver a visitar Es más un monólogo que un blog. mañana ya saben como va y panque en martes de como va y panque este si que nos vemos la próxima semana o en mi canal ya saben si les gusta estos suscribanse a animal lovers y ya saben si llegamos a los 100 yo de un videoblog en boxers y si lo haré lo prometo este yo me despido","Hello everyone, how are you? I'm another Londoner from RANDMAN ANIMAL OVERS and the theme of this week is how we made us ATAKU. Let's start with my story. I made my ATAKU about 13 years ago. About 6 years ago and I was 13 years old. I started reading comics in this world of Fluriky. I started with all the superheroes of Superman, Batman, the Green Internet. I loved all of them. I really liked comic series. There are many comic series, thanks to some friends who know a comic store. In fact, I attended them. I read Infinite Crisis, Identity Crisis, Civil War, Infinite Land Crisis, this phone. What else did Superman Sol do? Batman falls from the wall. Very good series. But I got bored. I started to read manga. The first manga that Ichigo made was a good story. Thanks to one of the two guys who attended. I loved comics and manga. I bought 19 tomos after buying all the 19 tomos of this series. Thanks to them I didn't need to buy manga for the series. I read them and read stories like X-Clamp, Subasa Reserve Chronicles, Cowboy Bebop, Chrono Crusade, Ayori Aoshi, Tenjo Tenje, Bleach, Kateki Hitman Reborn, Akuma, Enuyasha, Juyohakusho. I'm sorry to say that I read them during my time in that comic store, going as a visitor. Unfortunately, the store is closed. I miss it to be honest, that store brings me good memories every time I go outside, I get nostalgia. But that's another story. After that I started to... I started to get interested in seeing if they had an animation. This is the same series. And that's how I got into the anime world. I started with Nichigo 100, well, not Oryo-den, I started with Evangelion, and there were a hundred series, now not Tondashimo, Bleach, Loveless, Gravitational, Hong Kong Romantic, Weech, many series, many anime that I saw, well I've seen up to this date and I still see them. In fact I have many series of tenies that I read, although I know what's going to happen but I would like to see. After that I started to make conventions, thanks to my friend Ivan I started liking cosplay. The first cosplay that I did was I made a crosshairs of Bleach, a very good cosplay and it is like my influence, I was saying, well, let's go to the Displaced convention and that's how I started with cosplay, the first cosplay that went from Alucard that was not so good, it was one of RADMA which is my favorite cosplay and at the time each that I do I ask for many photos, I really like to be cosplay and also the Zero Taku helped me to meet a lot of people, all the guys here, my friends from the comic store, people who even visited I think that's my story of comice otaku. It's more a monologue than a vlog. And I think that's all. I say goodbye, Scarlett, Hola, you said we send you greetings. And I think that's all for now. You know, I don't know if you've already uploaded it, Mr. Fernando, or your video. Give it a go, it's a good vlogger. tomorrow you know how it goes and I'll be in March from how it goes and I'll be this so see you next week or on my channel you know if you like these subscribe to animal lovers and you know if we get to 100 I give a video blog in boxers and if I do I promise this I say goodbye"

I know it sounds wrong, but it's cocking mechanism. like this. Before you have to pull back kinda hard to pull back, but then after you've done it it's pretty easy and the spring goes off. You should like that. It's pretty loud though. And the clip release right here, this little button, like so. It's a clip, it's very light. This gun overall, about a pound and a half. It's really light. But yeah, it comes out, goes in very quickly and easily. Legally, you're not allowed to spring. or take off the orange part right here. Safety right here. So if you need someone and you don't want to shoot them, that's what you want to do. Alright, now here's this gun is made especially for .12g BBs. It works actually better than .25g.

That's what you want to call it. I think most of us actually thought that there was going to be a little bit of waves. There are no waves. I sort of realized we shouldn't have brought our boards because it was dead flat. I think by that stage it was a bit sunburnt and getting a bit boring. I don't know, I just seen the sticks on my head but I don't know. There's nothing else to do. Tori was getting a bit bored too so grabbed a tow rope. Me and Nathan Carroll set up his golf tees with sticks and we're trying to hit nuts at him. Trying to wreck his fun with golf nuts. Everybody was pretty bored. We kind of knew beforehand that we weren't going to get any swell so it was kind of a little bit of a disappointment getting onto the boats but what can I say, every day is a good day. and there was one day where a small like six foot northwest swole came in. So our house was right here at Leftovers and we went out there and had some fun and Erica was ripping and I was cooking it. We got a paddle out at Leftovers. There's a fun little inside reform shorebreak going on and we had to Rocky Point for the evening surf. They went surfing at Lonnie's today and they're both incredible surfers, both from Kauai. I think they live pretty close to each other, surf all the time together and definitely impressed with their surfing. They're so young and talented, so it's cool to see. They just came in for the day, but it's definitely good energy. Well, today me and Strayly, we just went out to left overs and no one was out and we just went out there and shot a couple water shots. I really like shooting fish eye water shots. Super fun because you go out there and you could think that you got the best photos in the world and come in and they're all crap. And so it's always really fun to just go out there and just try and see what you can get. You can still get like really cool looking photos. And I like photography and we went and did that. and just cruise for the afternoon and we actually got a couple photos. It was really fun. Wade is definitely one of the better surfers on this trip. He's very modest. He's a good guy. He doesn't want to get too cocky. He definitely, definitely rips. The surf's been really shit. Sort of taking it as a holiday. Have to do something to make it interesting. Try all the oracles on it. Do a chop up or a headstand. Anything to make it exciting. so much fun here in Hawaii but I'm out of here going to Fiji.

Is Busan because of the heat in the baseball? Among the G-Star 2011 booths, the sports game-related booths were overflowing with celebrity-related customers. It is a game that developed a PC online version of the game, Minin 11, which sold 6 million copies of the world's invincible product, and a new booth that is a part of the ProYago MLB Manager Online. Most of the fans of the audience are fans of soccer or baseball, so the heat was hot. Winning 11 Online is a game where you choose the national team and the national team to play the game. It's a sports game that can simply and happily feel fun. The participation of young students has become soft. Choi Won-pichi, who filled the booth, achieved a goal. I think it's better to be able to control yourself through the players. I like sports, but I can enjoy it as a game. It's also better to enjoy it outside of the game. To promote the new MMB manager online, he showed the uniform of the famous Major League team's popular uniform and the national pro soccer team. The outside world was not enough to gain the attention of the players who were equipped with a lot of baseball hats and played sports games. I hope we can get a ticket to the game, like the game in the game of Infinite Challenge. We can play games with the game of FM, Baddies, and Winning. The 13th Sunday of the 13th Sunday of the G-Star 2011, which is open in Busan, is expected to be even hotter."

They talk about the coexistence and they talk about it. Here and there in the digital sites, they are like they are not looking at you. The loss of the poor and the housekeeper is the door to its door. And the mother of the poor is the right hand of the right hand and the right hand of the right hand. Dr. Abdul Aziz, come to me from the history of the Qatif since birth, come to me with the measure of the size of blood, the proof of the causes of the Qatif, the source of which is the origin or the source of which is the origin. Yes. I will find Dr. Abdul Aziz and the media to follow the opposite and the advice and give it to the true meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning of the word, or the meaning Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Qasim, you speak of a single country that is full of people. You always speak of conversations and talk about the struggle of the hatred as a project in killing the one who has forbidden Allah. I want to tell you that the most important thing is to be able to be a person who is not afraid of the hatred of others. The grace of the Sheikh of Darwish was one of the first to see this intercession. You have heard and I have heard from the great man and the great call of Dr. Saad Al-Braik, may Allah protect him. We have heard from the group of the Shtaqi and the Tawheed Al-Saf and the community on a equal footing. and that some of us will not take some of us without Allah The majority of the people in this country are the ones who are the most important. I ask you, Dr. Mohamed, and Sheikh Saleh, and the viewers to take the result of the episode. The question was about the coexistence between Sunnah and Shia in one country. They need political decisions. The votes were for the viewers to vote. I pray to God that the best of the believers will not be lost I say that the great issue is the issue of personal interests. Yes, because the director said that it was over 5 minutes. You told me that 10 minutes. The situation of the coexistence between the two sons of the one country has been established. We have reached a consensus that can be strengthened. There is no doubt that the way to make a long front of its supplications is not bad. The situation is still in a political decision. The situation that has been discussed is a problem. The opening of the Kareem, the two shaykhs, the Darwish and the Abdul Kareem were positive. The country was able to make a positive opening for the people of Qatif. Despite some scholars' objections, unfortunately, we are faced with the brotherly visits between the two tribes, which are the ones that make the mind stronger for the psychological return. Thank you for your attention."

Пока диктор по стадиону объявлял составы, хозяева успели всерьез побеспокоить галкипера гостей Давида Гегалаева, а Арсен Хугулов едва не спровоцировал массовую потасовку. Арбитр встречил Аюшкин, тут же снизил нарастающий напоет температуру при помощи горчичников. Следом в игровом эпизоде травма получил левой защитник хозяев Симчевич, которого уже на 10 минуте вынуждено был заменить горбонец. По игре в первом тайме предпочтительные смотрелись гости. Саранские футболисты под грузом ответственности часто ошибались в простых ситуациях, тогда как Владиковка сцепили предельно собранными. И на исходе получаться подопечные Газаева сумели наказать оборону Мордовии за оплошность. Бразилий Цзилая выиграл позицию у защитника и пробил в касание. Чем привел в восторг Валерия Георгиевича, на которого запрет на курение на стадионах видимо не распространяется. свою излюбленную игру. Но дальним ударом Панченко не хватало прицела, а фирменным быстром многоходовкам с участием Руслана Мухамедшина, выверенных передач. Гости продолжали нагружать своего единственного форварда из элая «Охотно треполнер» в Исаранской публике. Десятитысячный стадион к слову заполнился недоотказа, зато смотрели матч-литеров ФНЛ даже с высоты птичьего полета. 15-минутного перерыва Фёдора Щербаченко хватило, чтобы привести своих подопечных в чувства. Начало второго тайма осталось полностью за хозяевами. Первый же атаки мяч влетел в ворота Давида Гигалаева, однако гол был отменен из-за офсайда, в котором в момент удара находился Панченко. без Симчевича Флангу и прострелил в Авратарскую. Гол, который впоследствии стал победным, зала и забил ценой травмы. Автора Дубля унесли споля на носилках. Последняя 15-ти минутка прошла на половине поля Алании, но осада ворот гостей результаты не принесла. Самый реальный шанс отыграться упустил вышедший на замену Андрей Пазин. Его удар за 5 минут до финального свистка парировал Давид Гигалайев. Лиги Вер взяла защиту. А Ланя Вочном, спорь с главным конкурентом, возвращает себе лидерство в таблице первенства ФНЛ. А Букмекеры считают убытки. правовое государство, то последнее высказывание как будут определяться какие-то договорные матча, то что с нами сейчас происходит, возня, это вся, я думаю, это просто нонсес, юридической базы никакой, все субъективно, в том числе и вот этот аж перед этой игрой. Надеюсь, что здравый смысл Футболи в российском возобладает. Я считаю это оскорбительно. Просто оскорбительно было касательно нашего клуба, потому что очень неприятный сегодня. Лишний раз все увидели, что это было неправда.","The first two leaders of the first FNL were exhausted by another letter from Udkoy. But the first minutes of the meeting showed that no one would play in Saransk in the underdogs. While the director of the stadium announced the composition, the owners had seriously worried about the goalkeeper of the guests Davida Gigalaev, and Arsen Kugulov did not provoke a massive toss. The referee met Yushkin, immediately lowered the heating at the field with the help of the fans. Therefore, in the gaming episode, the injury was received by the left defender of the owner of Simchivich, who has already been in the 10th minute, The first time the players were more likely to be invited to the game. The Sarans footballers were often in a difficult situation under the pressure of responsibility. Then, as the Caucasians looked very well-groomed. And on the way, the sub-signals managed to punish Mordovia's defense for the plight. Brazilidzelai won the defense position and broke into the touch. What brought the delight of Valery Georgievich, who is banned from smoking at the stadium, is apparently not spread. but the further punch was not enough to aim, and Ruslan Mukhamedshin's quick and quick approach was a proven pass. The guests continued to load their only forward, from the LA to the three-pointer of the Saransk public. The 10,000-meter stadium, in a word, was filled with refusal, but the fans watched the match from the FNL even from the height of the bird's flight. The 15-minute break from Fedor Shcherbachenko was enough to bring his sense of smell. The beginning of the second half was left completely behind the owners. The first attack and the ball flew into the gate of David Gigalaev, but the goal was canceled due to the offside, at which the punch was at the moment. Mordovia did not get confused, the Mordovians continued to push and at 53 minutes the judge and the case of the claim did not arise. Rustem Muhamedshin hit twice and with the second attempt broke the best defense of the FNL. The success of the development of the owners did not succeed. The guests immediately answered several counterattacks, one of which again marked the problems in the defense order of the Saransk team. Kubulov broke through the aceratized without a symchivich flange and shot into the goalie, who eventually became a winner, and then got injured. The double player was taken from the field on the toes. The last 15 minutes passed in the middle of the field, but the goalie of the guest gate did not bring the result. The most real chance to play was to let Andrey Pazin, who was left behind, score a goal for 5 minutes before the final whistle, to the goal of David Gigalayev. What can you comment on here? Good luck, I got into the ball, everything, nothing special. The team's leadership in the first place in the FNL is back. And the bookmakers are counting the losses. I hope that the legal state will be able to determine the legal rules and the legal basis of the game. I think it was a shame. It was a shame for our club. It's a very unpleasant thing. Today everyone was convinced that it was not true."

I'm not old. I cannot do this. I'm 70 something. I can't do this. I'm not old. I've got a car. I've got my recipe. I'm not giving up. I'm not going to sit here and wait to die. Literally, most people, you know, retirement fund, oh, then we can go to the beach and have some fun. You know, most people are waiting to get to death as safely as they bloody well can. There's no risk. There's no life. There's nothing. I was willing to give my life in the last three years to this light. And I'm still at any moment willing to give my life. This is my life now. And if anyone else doesn't like it, I couldn't care less. It makes no difference to me. This is what I'm here to do. And if you're here tonight, there is a reason. Your spirit is here to do this. something and it's like I know that people say oh enlightenment is the goal and and that's the only reason we hear yes and no. Yes that is of course why we're here is to become awakened, have the Kundalini Holy Light awaken within us and all these 700 million nutties awaken in electricity and then we go through the stargate which is awesome and it really rocks and all of that's great but what do you do on the way to that? What do we do to make our life Purposeful put on the gas mask not the gas mask That's putting on the gas mask. You want the oxygen mask you put the oxygen mask on yourself first Because I did the other thing and it nearly gassed me all I did I was working 18 hours a day Literally all I did was work work work and I wasn't setting enough time for this particular Observer Holy Spirit highest self That was my mistake. I nearly killed myself so many times because all I wanted to do was give. And then I had people involved because I thought that this was really going to be it with my business. And then when things didn't work there, it would bring me down more and I think I'd have to give more. And then the more I give, the sicker I would get. And until I met my enlightened teacher, I didn't really get it. We have to have time. for the spirit, for it to awaken, then you get the empowerment within you. Then you're never tired when you work. I could stand here, and some people have seen me do it, for three days. I've done it in the studio with no sleep and be exactly like I am now. You won't be, but I would be, so I might look different. Because when you're doing your purpose, you might feel like your body needs rest after you're finished, like I would tonight, three days. But while you're doing your purpose when that has come alive, that spirit and that empowerment within you, it's joyful. It rocks from editing a book that you're doing or setting up the coffee here which is Blessed Water by Guruji by the way, that particular water. So have a coffee and cookies and do your purpose. But what is your purpose? Your purpose is to be happy, to be happy. And then everything that you do If you were in a canning factory, your heart would still hunt the whole time. It doesn't stop once it starts. But we must, which is what I said in the beginning, we must take time for our spirit, for our observer. So it doesn't have to sit there going, 1000 years, frown dog day, while we're sleeping. It is beautiful. Call it a guardian angel. call it your holy light, call it your observer, it is real. Call it your true highest self, it is real. And the least that our stupid humans can do, us pillowcases, is to be roughy and be there for this observer. And when you're there for your observer, and you do the right things for the pillowcase, exercise it, eat properly, Drink plenty of fluids, rest it when it needs the rest, and get into the silence. This observer will not only create miracles in your life and a bliss and a joy that is indescribable. No intellect, no words can describe it. And then everywhere you go, whether you're at the post office, at a bank, anywhere you are, people will feel it. Some people may feel uncomfortable with it and not like you and not know why they don't like you but that doesn't matter because your spirit will still be talking to their spirit and it will still work because it's harmony we are all one everyone's spirit everyone's observer can speak to each other but like say you know there's one observer here this holy spirit hi Frank how are you today I'm not bad Dorothy how you doing oh I'm just you know waiting around I'll just keep talking to you you know because This one's still asleep. Ah, never mind. Well, we can have a little chat. Oh, but mine's not asleep, so I have to run. See you later. Whereas if they're both in pillowcases that are awake, Dorothy can speak to Frank and Frank can say, oh, Dorothy, could you be telling your little pillowcase there that they've got to go over to see this bloke Guruji or they've got to see Joseph or Johnny or Kim tomorrow? You know, can you just be telling them that? Just put that in their brain and just guide them for that. Put a big billboard sign up if you like. I don't care. a problem because then Dorothy can go into the brain into the spirit and guide you and you hear it you know it everyone gets it differently but you know it you feel peaceful when those when you're guided to do those things you feel calm it feels right it feels natural it feels natural","So all this is happening all this is being set into motion and the person's given up so it doesn't happen and then they say it doesn't work because they gave up Colonel Sanders could do it when he was in his 70s and he wasn't into meditation He just got in his car he was sitting around right in a retirement home and he had tried many different types of businesses and had some success in different businesses and he had his Chicken recipe and he was sitting around in this retirement home and he just said, I can't do this. I'm not old. I cannot do this. I'm 70 something. I can't do this. I'm not old. I've got a car. I've got my recipe. I'm not giving up. I'm not going to sit here and wait to die. Literally, most people, you know, retirement fund, oh, then we can go to the beach and have some fun. You know, most people are waiting to get to death as safely as they bloody well can. There's no risk. There's no life. There's nothing. I was willing to give my life in the last three years to this light. And I'm still at any moment willing to give my life. This is my life now. And if anyone else doesn't like it, I couldn't care less. It makes no difference to me. This is what I'm here to do. And if you're here tonight, there is a reason. Your spirit is here to do this. something and it's like I know that people say oh enlightenment is the goal and and that's the only reason we're here yes and no yes that is of course why we're here is to become awakened have the Kundalini holy light awaken within us and all these 700 million nutties awaken electricity and then we go through the stargate which is awesome and it really rocks and all of that's great but what do you do on the way to that what do we do to make our life Purposeful put on the gas mask not the gas mask That's putting on the gas mask. You want the oxygen mask you put the oxygen mask on yourself first Because I did the other thing and it nearly gassed me all I did I was working 18 hours a day Literally all I did was work work work and I wasn't setting enough time for this particular Observer Holy Spirit highest self That was my mistake. I nearly killed myself so many times because all I wanted to do was give. And then I had people involved because I thought that this was really going to be it with my business. And then when things didn't work there, it would bring me down more and I think I'd have to give more. And then the more I give, the sicker I would get. And until I met my enlightened teacher, I didn't really get it. We have to have time. for the spirit, for it to awaken, then you get the empowerment within you. Then you're never tired when you work. I could stand here, and some people have seen me do it, for three days. I've done it in the studio with no sleep and be exactly like I am now. You won't be, but I would be, so I might look different. Because when you're doing your purpose, you might feel like your body needs rest after you're finished, like I would tonight, three days. But while you're doing your purpose when that has come alive, that spirit and that empowerment within you, it's joyful. It rocks from editing a book that you're doing or setting up the coffee here which is Blessed Water by Guruji by the way, that particular water. So have a coffee and cookies and do your purpose. But what is your purpose? Your purpose is to be happy, to be happy. And then everything that you do If you were in a canning factory, your heart would still hunt the whole time. It doesn't stop once it starts. But we must, which is what I said in the beginning, we must take time for our spirit, for our observer. So it doesn't have to sit there going, 1000 years, frown dog day, while we're sleeping. It is beautiful. Call it a guardian angel. call it your holy light, call it your observer, it is real. Call it your true highest self, it is real. And the least that our stupid humans can do, us pillowcases, is to be roughy and be there for this observer. And when you're there for your observer, and you do the right things for the pillowcase, exercise it, eat properly, Drink plenty of fluids, rest it when it needs the rest, and get into the silence. This observer will not only create miracles in your life and a bliss and a joy that is indescribable. No intellect, no words can describe it. And then everywhere you go, whether you're at the post office, at a bank, anywhere you are, people will feel it. Some people may feel uncomfortable with it and not like you and not know why they don't like you but that doesn't matter because your spirit will still be talking to their spirit and it will still work because it's harmony we are all one everyone's spirit everyone's observer can speak to each other but like say you know there's one observer here this holy spirit hi Frank how are you today I'm not bad Dorothy how you doing oh I'm just you know waiting around I'll just keep talking to you you know because This one's still asleep. Ah, never mind. Well, we can have a little chat. Oh, but mine's not asleep, so I have to run. See you later. Whereas if they're both in pillowcases that are awake, Dorothy can speak to Frank and Frank can say, oh, Dorothy, could you be telling your little pillowcase there that they've got to go over to see this bloke Guruji or they've got to see Joseph or Johnny or Kim tomorrow? You know, can you just be telling them that? Just put that in their brain and just guide them for that. Put a big billboard sign up if you like. I don't care. a problem because then Dorothy can go into the brain, into the spirit and guide you and you hear it. You know it. Everyone gets it differently. But you know it. You feel peaceful when you're guided to do those things. You feel calm. It feels right. It feels natural. It feels natural."

So we will create a photo of the man from the first image. We use the magic wand and we will create a man's image. So we will leave some parts that are not created for the white parts. We will create a big image. Of course, the degree, the tolerance. I found that this method is a suitable way to get a little bit of tension and patience. We come to the back of the face. Instead of cleaning the man directly on the picture, and therefore, for example, if we added a man directly on the picture here, and we did the exit, if I forgot, the man became part of the picture, and he did not move, and he could not do it properly.

Sélia o livro até o tempo do fim. Muitos correrão dele e para ele, e a ciência se multiplicará. O fim do mundo realmente ocorrerá, se for quando? Esse é uma das mais importantes e misteriosas perguntas de todos os tempos. O profeta bíblico Daniel predisse claramente que ao final da história do mundo nós veríamos um aumento dramático no conhecimento. considera, por exemplo, como os meios de transporte mudaram dramaticamente em épocas recentes? Por 60 séculos, o meio mais rápido de transporte foi viajar a cavalo. Agora, viagens que demoravam meses são realizadas em minutos. Em uma geração, a revolução dos computadores trouxe mudanças tão radicais que nossos antepassados jamais imaginariam. Mas numa interpretação mais exata deste verso, é que o conhecimento a respeito dos livros profegios E você ouvirá de guerras e rumores de guerras? Tudo isso será o começo das dores. Incluindo terremotos, incêndios, inundações, tornados, tormentas assassinas num clima bizarro, tudo a caminho da destruição final do planeta. Incrivelmente, o apóstolo João profetizou que, ao se aproximar o tempo do fim, aumentaria a habilidade do homem em destruir o planeta. Apocalipse 11, verso 18, diz que que esta previsão foi vividamente cumprida. Por séculos, o homem apenas fazia suas guerras com lãs as fumigantes ou seus canhões à pólvora. Hoje possuem armas devastadoras que podem rapidamente exterminar com a vida no planeta. Fato é que Jesus profetizou se sua vinda fosse adiada, ninguém sobreviveria. O próprio Cristo nos alertou sobre estes perigos, mas que eles seriam apenas o início do fim. E o homem fazer alguma coisa que pudesse dar início ao tempo do fim? Ninguém que é já vivido pelas últimas décadas poderá negar a contínua espantosa queda moral de nossa sociedade moderna. Cada geração continuamente abre o envelope de aceitação comportamental. Como resultado, cada uma das gerações sucessoras operam sob um padrão moral mais baixo do que o seu padrão anterior. Infelizmente, parece não haver um fim a essa trilha vergonhosa. Nos dias de Noé, a decadência moral condenou o planeta, a destruição com o de Lúcia, No dia de Ló, as perversas e depravadas Sodome e Gomorra foram cidades consumidas com o fogo do céu. Assim como nos dias de Ló, eles comiam, bebiam, compravam, vendiam, plantavam, construiam, mas no dia em que Ló saiu da cidade, caiu fogo e enxofre do céu e consumiu a todos. Assim também será no dia em que o filho do homem se manifestar. E em nossos dias, Poderia ser incontrolável e moralidade perversão, novamente motivo para uma condenação vinda dos céus? com os mortos, extensamente proibidas pelas escrituras, tem amplamente sido aceitas, inclusive em igrejas modernas. Programas de televisão e filmes, apresentando os temas do arrebatamento e do acotismo, tornaram o assunto extremamente popular, especialmente entre os mais jovens. Apesar de todo este espiritualismo incontrolável e moralidade, a Bíblia ensina que onde o pecado está em abundância, a grácia está em superabundância. Portanto, uma grande notícia para os últimos dias, antes da volta de Jesus, foi a promessa de que as boas novas seriam anunciadas por todo mundo. Então este Evangelho do Reino será pregado em todo mundo em testemunha a todas as nações, então virá o fim. A Bíblia revela que estamos vivendo, obviamente, nos últimos dias. O aumento da ciência, estabilidade global, declínio moral, um explosivo interesse pelo cotismo, todos testificam o tempo do fim. Os sinais do fim estão claramente se cumprindo, mas, ainda mais, a Bíblia também nos alerta que, entre as forças do bem e do mal, em última instância elevada, A verá então grande tribulação, como jamais se viu anteriormente, nem jamais saberá. talvez até um terremoto, um asteroide ou algum outro evento cataclísmico, talvez um acidente químico ou uma praga biológica mortal, talvez a combinação de alguns desses acidentes, mas mesmo a Bíblia não identificando o evento crítico exato, ela revela as dramáticas cenas que se seguem, mas adiante você compreenderá mais sobre essas surpreendentes, chocantes eventos que muitos cristãos ainda não estão preparados.","But you, Daniel, close these words. Consider, for example, how transport means changed dramatically in recent times. For sixty centuries, the fastest means of transport was to travel by horse. Now, journeys that took months are made in minutes. In a generation, the revolution of computers brought so radical changes that our ancestors would never imagine. But in an exact interpretation of this verse, it is that knowledge about the professional books and as a warning, this is what happened. All this will be the beginning of the pain. Anyone can see in the whole world how much political and natural forces have become our modern world a dangerous place to live. Think about it. In the last 100 years the whole world faced two world wars, several other conflicts, without mentioning the increase in terrorist attacks, in addition to this an increase in the mortality rate in natural disasters. including earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes, torments the assassins in a bizarre climate, all the way to the final destruction of the planet. Incredibly, the apostle John prophesied that when the time of the end approaches, the ability of man would increase and destroy the planet. that this prevision was vividly fulfilled. For centuries, man only did his wars with smoking lamps or his poor dogs. Today, there are devastating weapons that can quickly exterminate life on the planet. The fact is that Jesus prophesied that if his life were given, no one would survive. Christ himself warned us about these dangers, but that they would only be the beginning of the end. And the man, doing something that could start the end of time, knows that the last days will be difficult. The men will be lovers of themselves. Lovers of money, greedy, jealous, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ingratious, profane, without love, irreconcilable, fofokers, without own domain, cruel, without consideration with the good. Nobody who has lived for the last decades will be able to deny the continuous and frightening fall of our modern society. Each generation continuously opens the behavioral acceptance envelope. As a result, each of the successive generations operates under a more low moral standard than its previous standard. Unfortunately, it seems to have no end to this shameful trail. In the days of Noé, the moral decay condemned the planet, the destruction with which it was born, In the days of Law, the perverses and depraved Sodom and Gomorrah were cities consumed by the fire of Heaven. Just as in the days of Law, they ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, built, but on the day when Law left the city, the fire and the rain of Heaven fell and consumed everyone. Just as it will also be on the day when the Son of Man will manifest himself. And in our days, Could it be a controllable immorality and perversion? Again, a reason for a condemnation coming from heaven? Along with immorality, our society is decayed, the Bible warns us that in the last days there would be a dramatic growth in spiritualism and occultism. Now the spirit says, terminally, that in the last days some would abandon faith, giving ears to deceitful spirits and demons. with the dead, extensively forbidden by the scriptures, have been widely accepted, including in modern churches. TV and movies programs, presenting the themes of arrebatment and occultism, have become a subject that is extremely popular, especially among the younger ones. Despite all this spiritualism, uncontrollable morality, the Bible teaches that where sin is in abundance, grace is in super abundance. Therefore, a great news for the last days before the return of Jesus was the promise The good news would be announced by everyone. So this Kingdom's Gospel will be preached in everyone, in all nations, so it will be the end. There is apparently an unsurpassable mission to communicate the Gospel to the four corners of the Earth. It is a quick reality. Commissioners, books, vices, transmissions via satellite and internet, the Gospel has spread rapidly around the world. The Bible reveals that we are living, obviously, in the last days. The increase in science, global stability, moral decline, an explosive interest in the occultism, all test the time of the end. The signs of the end are clearly understood, but even more so, the Bible also warns us that, between the forces of good and evil, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns us that, in the last elevated instance, the Bible also warns What will be the catastrophe that will start the final crisis? And when will it happen? Could it be a terrorist attack? Maybe an international economic crisis? Maybe even a earthquake, an asteroid or some other cataclysmic event? Maybe a chemical accident or a biological death plague? Maybe the combination of some of these accidents. But even the Bible does not identify the exact critical event, it reveals the dramatic scenes that follow. But later you will understand more about these surprising, shocking events that many Christians are not yet prepared."

The outside of the backpack is made from both Dabi and Ripstop nylon, an excellent combination of lightweight, weather resistance and durability. And each interior access point is protected by a weather-sealed rubberized YKK zipper. On the front of the bag, there is a bungee cord that provides quick storage for a rain jacket or windbreaker. behind the bungee cord is one of the many special features of the shootout backpack, a multi-stage tripod carrier that we call the Mystic System. The three stages of the Mystic System accommodate virtually any size tripod. In stage one, there is quick storage for a small tripod. Just attach the three Velcro loops around the legs and then engage the compression straps at the top of the front flap. For a medium-sized tripod, the front flap bends in the middle and the and attaches to clips on the bottom to create what we call stage two. By lowering the tripod by about five inches, this puts the weight back in balance. If your tripod is too big for this configuration, then you can get to stage three by folding the front flap all the way down and clipping the compression straps around the bottom of the tripod legs. This will allow you to carry a tripod that is much larger than the backpack itself while still maintaining proper weight distribution If you're not using a tripod, the compartment still has a fully weather sealed zipper around it, which makes it perfect for storing delicate camera and computer accessories. A round of the side of the backpack is another exclusive feature. Quick access pods that give you the ability to swap out lenses, flash, and other equipment without ever taking off the backpack. The storage capability of the side pods varies according to the size of the pack, but for the medium and large sized backpacks, the side pods will fit a size zoom lens like a 24-70mm 2.8mm. All this is designed to ensure that you never miss a shot because your backpack gets in the way of your work. The Expedition Grade Harness combines substantial padding and ventilated mesh material to provide hours of carrying comfort. All shootout backpacks, except the smallest mini size, include a full waist belt to ensure that the weight of the bag is evenly distributed to your lower back and hips where your body can safely support the weight. The waist belt is even removable for those times when there isn't enough weight in the pack to require it. Dedicated top and side handles make it easy to carry the pack when your shoulders need a break or when you want to load it into the overhead compartment of an airplane. To prevent the shoulder straps and waist belt from getting caught on anything when the pack is being stowed, a zippered cover that hides behind the harness seals everything up neatly. Reversing the compression straps allows you to securely attach the backpack to your rolling luggage. Stored behind a zipper on the bottom of the case is Temba's exclusive weather wrap cover, the fastest, easiest auxiliary rain cover around, which provides another level of protection. Since it's completely removable, it can be easily dried or cleaned if it gets wet or dirty. Inside the bag, there are two compartments. The main compartment opens with a two-way zipper and contains a densely padded, fully customizable insert. All shootout backpacks, regardless of size, will fit two professional camera bodies with lenses attached, plus a variety of additional lenses, flash equipment, and other accessories. In the small, medium, and large size, the insert is completely removable just by grabbing the handle at the top and pulling it out. This not only allows you to use the backpack for non-photographic purposes, but it also allows you to easily swap out camera systems if you have additional inserts which are available as an accessory. A zipper at the top opens up the laptop sleeve at the back. Depending on the size of the shootout backpack, this sleeve will fit everything from small laptops all the way up to the largest 17 inch models. Shootout backpacks are available in three different colors and four different sizes, and the medium and large backpacks are available with optional inline skate wheels. If there's rain, snow, sleet, or sand where you live, Then the Temba Shootout backpack will ensure that your equipment stays safe when the weather sends its worst. Oh man!

On the front of the bag, there is a bungee cord that provides quick storage for a rain jacket or windbreaker. behind the bungee cord is one of the many special features of the shootout backpack, a multi-stage tripod carrier that we call the Mystic System. The three stages of the Mystic System accommodate virtually any size tripod. In stage one, there is quick storage for a small tripod. Just attach the three Velcro loops around the legs and then engage the compression straps at the top of the front flap. For a medium-sized tripod, the front flap bends in the middle and the and attaches to clips on the bottom to create what we call stage two. By lowering the tripod by about five inches, this puts the weight back in balance. If your tripod is too big for this configuration, then you can get to stage three by folding the front flap all the way down and clipping the compression straps around the bottom of the tripod legs. This will allow you to carry a tripod that is much larger than the backpack itself while still maintaining proper weight distribution If you're not using a tripod, the compartment still has a fully weather sealed zipper around it, which makes it perfect for storing delicate camera and computer accessories. A round of the side of the backpack is another exclusive feature. Quick access pods that give you the ability to swap out lenses, flash, and other equipment without ever taking off the backpack. The storage capability of the side pods varies according to the size of the pack, but for the medium and large sized backpacks, the side pods will fit a size zoom lens like a 24-70mm 2.8mm. All this is designed to ensure that you never miss a shot because your backpack gets in the way of your work. The Expedition Grade Harness combines substantial padding and ventilated mesh material to provide hours of carrying comfort. All shootout backpacks, except the smallest mini size, include a full waist belt to ensure that the weight of the bag is evenly distributed to your lower back and hips where your body can safely support the weight. The waist belt is even removable for those times when there isn't enough weight in the pack to require it. Dedicated top and side handles make it easy to carry the pack when your shoulders need a break or when you want to load it into the overhead compartment of an airplane. To prevent the shoulder straps and waist belt from getting caught on anything when the pack is being stowed, a zippered cover that hides behind the harness seals everything up neatly. Reversing the compression straps allows you to securely attach the backpack to your rolling luggage. Stored behind a zipper on the bottom of the case is Temba's exclusive weather wrap cover, the fastest, easiest auxiliary rain cover around, which provides another level of protection. Since it's completely removable, it can be easily dried or cleaned if it gets wet or dirty. Inside the bag, there are two compartments. The main compartment opens with a two-way zipper and contains a densely padded, fully customizable insert. All shootout backpacks, regardless of size, will fit two professional camera bodies with lenses attached, plus a variety of additional lenses, flash equipment, and other accessories. In the small, medium, and large size, the insert is completely removable just by grabbing the handle at the top and pulling it out. This not only allows you to use the backpack for non-photographic purposes, but it also allows you to easily swap out camera systems if you have additional inserts which are available as an accessory. A zipper at the top opens up the laptop sleeve at the back. Depending on the size of the shootout backpack, this sleeve will fit everything from small laptops all the way up to the largest 17 inch models. Shootout backpacks are available in three different colors and four different sizes, and the medium and large backpacks are available with optional inline skate wheels. If there's rain, snow, sleet, or sand where you live, then the Temba Shootout backpack will ensure that your equipment stays safe when the weather sends its worst. Oh man! Everybody loves those Temba bags! Temba bags!"

Pa zite, to je dimna zavjesa. Osnovni sukob u ovoj državi u taj sukob je involviran liberalni savet Crne Gore, jeste sukob između snagast, sada se uvijek na srednog rola, Kada mi kažemo, kada mi kažemo Cernogora, želimo ovakvu Cernogoru, u okvirenu sažutim zezdecama.

Ali atetak u azorom.","I can't keep my mouth shut because I know that great wisdom, historical courts, and great unbearable in the closed talks, in which the usual better goes through different phrases and demagogues than the thought-provoking people who doubt. That is, they think. The child of a crook who uses the London law, who votes, who in law uses the good words and very arguments. But that is not all the truth. There is a French employee who says, if you don't know, get used to it so that you can hear all four layers of Paris. We have to be loud, because those who turn around have a hard ear. I want to give you some attention to some things. Now, various enemies of Yugoslavia are being captured. There are Ustash, Chetniks, Nelicevci, Ljotičevci, Communists, Nationalists, Monarchists. Watch out! This is a smokey village. The main source of smoke in this state, in that source, is the liberal union of Montenegro. and the power that wants radical social reform. You cannot allow us to be robbed with their invoclour. We are for independent Montenegro. Many times we explained why we want it. But to say that we want to simply avoid, to avoid this civilisation ghetto, We want to avoid the dark clouds that are built on the hillside of the Berlin Wall. It is not strange that no one lives in such a state. On the border tables of those states, instead of its name, you need to leave every hope you enter. You must vote for the future. The future with the liberal union, if it wins the elections, it will not be a struggle, it will be a very difficult future. But I can guarantee you one thing, that future will be a dream, a dream of the game. And together we will try to make it beautiful. And they have missed us so much, that for the same reason, in Svacarnaga, Mor, there must be a family, The family that only thinks about one goal. How does that house look like what is said on the green fence? When I say I don't think about the green fence. The convincing around us that we are brave, that we are not brave. Those who consider us to be young, that we are young, that we are young. Those who say that we loved chess, that we do not love chess, that we love chess. After this film recording, no comment is needed. Maybe it's just a pity that the Makardija of his orders did not reach all the citizens of Montenegro. Because the Liberation Council of Montenegro had the opportunity to present it to the public in your court. We would not need so much if we presented this documentary recording to the citizens of Montenegro. The Liberation Council will present the vision of the establishment of its political institutions. The economy, the social and cultural issues, the topic of the information, will clearly and publicly tell us what it thinks and what it intends to do. We have one music number for the end.

And I am sure that if Nizaar there was a lot of work and it was much better. Do you know Mahmoud Murrah? Mahmoud Murrah is a very important Egyptian model. He told me that a few days ago, he went to his mother to participate in a fair. What does it mean? The news is starting again. The fair is called Kofiya Sona Palestine. Mahmoud went to a fair that he couldn't come here because he couldn't take a photo. So Mahmoud went there and did her three hours of return to the fair. She went half way and she showed it to two women. The eye gallery in Joulan and the park in Haifa Mahmoud, good bye and may God bless you. And now, where are you? Where are you? Where are you today? It's to the father's evidence. The evidence of the crimes in the past week in the return trip that was in two villages, Kuikat and Amqaf, in two cities. The evidence of the crimes, its identity, is in the information. After the evidence was finished, it flew to Jordan. Why? Because from there, it flew to the Kingdom of the Sea. What's the evidence there? The case was a participation of the MAHRAJAN, the MENAMER, the FUNUNNAN CITIZEN, in the leadership of the music team, Nassir Shamma. And not only that, the case will also be a meeting on the Palestinian streets that will hold a national movement for students in the U.S. university. And other than that, there is a CD that will give you a good afternoon and we look forward to seeing you again. And now, let's move on to the final speech. But remember, I will put it on my mind."

What are you doing with my sister? It's okay, see me just giving her ride home after he helped me out with some stupid girls from school and that we're giving you a hard time with our keeper. Thanks again. I'll see you around, okay? Sure. Sorry for a second. If you were really trying to help my sister out, then thank you. But I know what's going on between you and someone else.

Anleihen mit negativen Ausblick. Rohstoffe zwischen den Stühlen. Edelmetalle und alternative Investments positiv. Portfolioabsicherung & hoher Kassenbestand notwendig.,"2012, Anlagestrategie",644,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/vwRk-BJYbSo.mp3,"Guten Tag. Auf meiner Seite. Ich lasse Sie nochmal begrüßen zu unserer Onlinekonferenz bezüglich der Anlagestrategie, das Marko-ökonomische Bild. Haben Sie ja von meinem Kollegen Hannes Zipfel ausführlich zu Gemüte geführt bekommen. Konkret, welche Zusammenfassung sehen wir aus diesem Marko-ökonomischen Bild für die einzelnen Anlageklassen? Für die Aktien sind wir aufgrund der Konjunktur Abstimmung, die wir jetzt kurzfristig erwarten, neutral positioniert. Für Anleihen, Unternehmensanleihen, Also nominale Werte sind wir negativ bezüglich unserer Einschätzung. Nicht zuletzt auch der Vorstand der Commerzbank, Herr Blessing will ja alle unter Staatsanleihen verkaufen, inklusive deutsche Anleihen, drückt also auch hier seine negative Erwartung zu dieser Anlageklasse entsprechend aus. Wenn man im Anleimbereich positioniert sein wollte, so dann höchst, eigentlich nur im Bereich der Wandlanleien, da hier eben noch Die Wahrscheinlichkeit am größten ist unsere Einschätzung nach, dass Unternehmen in der Lage sind, die Anleihen auch zurückzuzahlen. Für Rohstoffe sind wir insgesamt auch neutral positioniert. Auf der einen Seite sehen wir die positiven Entwicklungen aufgrund der Geldpolitik. Auf der negativen Seite eben auch hier die Konjunkturabkühlung. Und für den Bereich der Edelmetalle sind wir sehr positiv, was unsere Einschätzung nach angeht. Aufgrund der geldpolitischen Maßnahmen, die wir hier erwarten. Zum anderen auch in diesem Falle Gold, insbesondere eben aufgrund der Eskalation der Eurozone positiv einzuschätzen. Für den Bereich Alternative Investments sind wir ebenfalls sehr positiv gestimmt. Hierunter sehen wir unsere Portfolio Absicherungsinstrumente. Hier nutzen wir zum einen die Volatilität und zum anderen Kreditausfallversicherungen auf Unternehmen, nicht auf Staaten, hier explizit, also wir nutzen es nicht zu spicklativem Zwecken, sondern ausschließlich zur Portfolio Absicherung. Hier rechts mal dargestellt, die Allokation unseres Modellportfolios und die einzelnen Anlageklassen, die wir hier nutzen, bezüglich ihrer Gewichtung. Portfolioabsicherung aufgrund der Erwartung hier kurzfristig negativer Art relativ hochgewichtet. 26 Prozent Absicherung des Portfolios gegen systemische Risiken mit Edelmetallen und Min als kleine Beimischung. Darüber hinaus halten wir aktuell relativ hohe Kassequote mit rund 21 Prozent wobei wir hier unsere Liquidität hauptsächlich im kanadischen Dollar halten und in kleinen Bereichen sind wir im Aktienbereich schon engagiert, hier eben zumeist im Infrastrukturbereich, weil wir die geldpolitischen Maßnahmen hier als erstes in der Wirkung sich entfalten sehen. Und zum kleinen Bereich noch die Rohstoffe eben auch aufgrund des Kaufkraftschutzes. Wir möchten heute noch mal näher eingehen auf ein Instrument der Portfolioabsicherung. Das sind eben diese Kreditausfalt. Versicherungen, die wir hier nutzen, was hier möglich ist oder was Sie hier sehen, sind zum einen die Rendite-Aufschläge von Unternehmensanleihen in Europa oder in Deutschland von Unternehmen gegen die deutschen Staatsanleihe bzw. USA eben gegenüber den amerikanischen Staatsanleihen. Und was Sie hier sehen, sind, dass die Rendite-Aufschläge von Unternehmen gegenüber diesen Staatsanleihen sehr niedrig sind aktuell, was hier möglich ist, wenn sich die Rezession verschärft, die Konjunktur abkühlt, sehen Sie 2008, wenn hier die Renditen entsprechend wieder nach oben gehen für Unternehmensanleihen, dann können wir hier mit den Instrumenten, die wir im Portfolio einsetzen, positiv die Konjunktur absichern. Wir haben also eine Konjunktur Hatch, wenn die Konjunktur sich hier eintrübt, zum anderen eben die Situation, wenn generell Abkehr von Anleihen, von dieser Anlageklasse eintritt, wie eben unter anderem die Kommerzbank das vornimmt, dann wird sich ebenfalls dieses Renditen Niveau deutlich erhöhen, sodass wir hier dann positiv abgesichert sind in unserem Portfolio. Das Portfolio selbst hat sich sehr positiv entwickelt und auch zuletzt positiv gehalten. Wir sehen hier als Referenzindex den MSCI World rein zu Performance-Darstellung gewählt. Grundsätzlich ist unser Portfolio ja benchmarkfrei, frei von Anlagezwängen in irgendwelchen Quoten. Wir sehen hier zuletzt im August hat sich der MSCI auf und der Entwicklung an den Kapitalmärkten sehr negativ entwickelt, mit einem Einbruch von in der Spitze über 20 Prozent. Während unser Portfolium vergleicht dazu, das Modellportfolien spricht hier, dargestellt, unsere dynamischen Vermögensverwaltungsstrategie doch sehr gut halten konnte und die Volatilität insgesamt, die Schwankungsbreite eben der Vermögensverwaltungsstrategie sehr gering ausgefallen ist. Das Ganze nochmal detaillierter dargestellt, eben für den Jahresverlaub seit Beginn dieses Jahres, während wir hier eben den Absturz beim allgemeinen Weltaktienindex sehen, konnten sich die Portfolios oder das Portfolio in der dynamischen Ausrichtung sehr positiv entwickeln, lag während dem ganzen Jahresverlauf im Plus, konnte sich jetzt wieder konsolidieren und zieht in der Wertentwicklung aktuell wieder an, die Daten per gestern, also auf dem neuesten Stand. Hier nochmal die Performance im Überblick, was eben wichtig ist unserer Einschätzung nach Wenn man die Kaufkraft erhalten möchte, zum einen in Sachwerte investieren natürlich. Sachwerte schwanken aber stark wie eben dargestellt anhand der Aktien Sachwerte wiederum MSCI World in Euro. In der Wertentwicklung über drei Jahre konnte eben unsere Strategie entsprechend auch überzeugen und was eben ganz wichtig ist Sachwerte, weil sie schwanken intelligent abgesichert anhand der Volatilität dargestellt. Das Risiko, das konnten wir entsprechend stark begrenzen, indem wir entsprechend die Portrait gut abgesichert und stabil aufgestellt haben und konnten uns auch in der Schwankungsbreite eben deutlich positiv von dem Referenzindex hier MSCI World in Euro abgrenzen. Volatilität seit Auflage des Portfolios mit 7,6 Prozent deutlich geringer als eben der MSCI World in Euro. Ja, kommen wir hier nochmal zur Zusammenfassung unserer Anlagepolitik für die nächsten Monate und für unser makroökonomisches Szenario. Bezüglich Aktien sind wir taktisch neutral positioniert, langfristig aber eben positiv aufgrund der zu erwartenden geldpolitischen Maßnahmen für Anleihen hier explizit den Rot dargestellt sind wir sehr negativ eingestellt. Wir empfehlen ausdrücklich keine Anlagen in festverzinslichen Wertpapieren vorzunehmen, das auch nicht wie im klassischen Vermögensverwaltungsansatz als Portfolio Absicherung zu sehen, sondern wir nutzen hier die entsprechenden Instrumente für die Portfolio Absicherung, Volatilität und Kreditausfallversicherung und verzichten bewusst auf Anleihen haben wir keine einzige Position. Für den Bereich Rohstoffe und insbesondere Edelmetalle als ultimative Währung sind wir sehr positiv gestimmt. Unabhängig von unserer Vermögensverwaltung empfehlen wir jedem Anleger eine Gewichtung in Edelmetallen von 5 bis 10 Prozent bezogen auf das Gesamtvermögen, also inklusive Versicherungsvermögen, Immobilien und auch Rentenansprüche zu berücksichtigen, um sich eben für die zu erwartenden Eskalationsstufen entsprechend vorzubereiten. Allgemeine Punkte, die wir in unserer Vermögensverwaltung berücksichtigen, sind eben die systemischen Risiken auf markereconomischer Ebene, wie sie mein Kollege Zipfel ja entsprechend ausgeführt hat. Hier nicht zuletzt eben Marktiliquidität und Staatsbankrotte, die wir ebenfalls in unserer Strategie als Worst Case mit berücksichtigen. Und darüber hinaus eben die Multiasit-Vermögensverwaltung der heutigen Zeit sollte alle Anlagen, lassen alle Arten von Sachwerten berücksichtigen, eben nicht nur auf Aktien als rendite Motor setzen, sondern insgesamt Aktien, Rohstoffe und auch Edelmetalle berücksichtigen. Noch mal herzlichen Dank für Ihre Teilnahme an der VSP Online Konferenz. Wir freuen uns darauf, Sie am nächsten zweiten Dienstag im Dezember wieder begrüßen zu dürfen. Wir danken uns für die sehr, sehr rege Teilnahme mit über 100 Teilnehmern und wünschen Ihnen bis zum nächsten Mal alles Gute und gute Geschäfte. Ihr Hannes Zipfel und Ihr Thomas Helena.","Good day, on my part. I would like to welcome you to our online conference regarding the system strategy, the Marko-Eukonomic picture. You have been very well received by my colleague Hannes Zipfel. Specifically, which conclusions do we see from this Marko-Eukonomic picture for the individual systems classes? For the actions, we are now in a neutral position due to the current mood, which we are now waiting for briefly, for companies, So nominal values are negative regarding our assessment. Not to the end, the chairman of the Commerce Bank, Mr. Blessing, wants to sell all under state bonds, including German bonds, so he also pushes his negative expectations to this investment class accordingly. If you want to be positioned in the bond area, then only in the area of ​​the trade bond, because here The biggest probability is that our estimates are that the companies in the situation pay back the amounts. For raw materials we are also in a neutral position. On the one hand we see the positive development due to the money policy, on the negative side also the consumption of cooling. And for the area of ​​the metal we are very positive about what our estimates are. Due to the money policy measures that we expect here, on the other hand also In this case, we estimate gold in particular due to the escalation of the Eurozone. For the area of alternative investments, we are also very positively tuned. Here we see our portfolio of insurance instruments. Here we use the volatility and the credit-experience insurance on companies, not on states. We do not use it for speculative purposes, but only for portfolio insurance. Here on the right, The allocation of our model portfolio and the individual storage classes that we use here are relatively high due to the expectation of a short-term negative rate of 26% of the portfolio's security against systemic risks with stainless steel and copper as a small mixture. We are engaged in small areas, in the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of the sector of The US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US and the US is very low on the US In 2008, when the rentals go up again for companies online, we can use the instruments we use in the portfolio to secure the conjecture. We have a conjecture hatch, when the conjecture is in place. In other cases, when the general transfer of the online class is entered, as the other DecoMerzbank takes it, then this rentals will also be in place. The portfolio has developed very positively and has been kept positive. As a reference index, we see the MSCI World selected to perform. Basically, our portfolio is benchmark-free and free of charge in some quotes. We see that in August, the MSCI has increased significantly in the last few months. and the development of the capital markets has developed very negatively, with a break of over 20% in the top. During our portfolio comparison, the model portfolio here shows that our dynamic supply-and-move strategy could hold very well and the volatility, overall the range of gravity of the supply-and-move strategy, has fallen very low. The whole thing is again, a detailed example, just for the year-end sale Since the beginning of this year, we have seen the fall in the general world share index. The portfolio could not develop very positively in the dynamic direction. During the whole year, there was a plus. Now it was possible to consolidate and draw on the value development again. The data per yesterday, so on the latest stand. Here again the performance in the overview. What is important is our assessment If you want to keep the purchasing power, invest in the value of the goods. But the value of goods is strong, as it is presented here. Then the value of the stocks is again in the MSCI World in Euro. In the value development over three years, our strategy could also be convinced. And what is very important is the value of goods, because they are smartly secured. Then the volatility is presented here. The risk, we could limit that accordingly. We have also been able to see that the portfolio has been well secured and stable and we could also be very positive about the reference index here at MSCI World in Euro. Volatility since the start of the portfolio, with 7.6% less than the MSCI World in Euro. Let's get back to the summary of our investment policy for the next few months and for our macroeconomic scenario. because of the expected amount of money. For employees who are explicitly presented with the red card, we are very negative. We recommend not to take any of the documents in solid paper, which is not a standard application of the company as a portfolio insurance, but we use the appropriate instruments for portfolio insurance, volatility and credit-experience insurance and deliberately We do not have a single position for the raw material, especially stainless steel. As an ultimate guarantee, we are very positively tuned. Regardless of our capacity, we recommend that each supplier, one weight in stainless steel from 5 to 10 percent, be it overall capacity, including insurance capacity, immobility and also rent agreements, to prepare for the expected escalation levels. The general points we consider in our distribution of goods are the systemic risks on the macroeconomic level, as my colleague Zipfelier has explained. Here we are not at the last market illiquidity and state bank frauds, which we also consider in our strategy as worst case. And above all, the multi-asset distribution of goods of today's time should leave all kinds of consumer goods, not only set on stocks as a rented engine, but also and also stainless steel. Thank you again for your participation at the VSP online conference. We look forward to welcoming you again on the next Tuesday in December. We thank you for the very, very rare participation with more than 100 participants and wish you all the best until next time. Your Hannes Zipfel and your Thomas Helena."

João também descobriu que cada uma dessas pessoas pode pagar uma pequena parcela por mês durante 72 meses. Através de sorteios mensais, ele e todos os outros participantes do grupo poderão sair de carro novo no final do prazo escolhido. Outra coisa importante que o João descobriu no consórcio em Caú é que não vai pagar juros nas parcelas e as taxas existentes são mais baratas do que as utilizadas em outros tipos de financiamento. Isso prova que o consórcio é a opção mais econômica para quem quer ter o carro ou imóvel dos sonhos.","Luckily, it is basically a group of people who meet to buy something, paying for a small part of their total value.

At the end of the specific deadline, all participants of this group should have received the car, truck, or the mobile that they chose. For example, João wants to buy a new car and decided to research some ways to do this account without spending much more than necessary. When he met the Itaú consort, he realized that other people also had the goal of buying a car. João also found out that each of these people can pay a small parcel per month for 72 months. Through monthly payments, he and everyone other participants of the group will be able to leave a new car at the end of the chosen time. Another important thing that João discovered in the Taú consortium is that he will not pay the payments in the parcels and the existing fees are cheaper than the ones used in other types of financing. This proof of consortium is the most economical option for those who want to have a car or a dream car."

I'm Roger Moore. You know folks if you follow any of my videos my blog posts, you know that one of the things I talk a lot about is the importance of exercise and had a couple conversations with clients this morning about motivation desire to get out and exercise and And you know there's been a big change in my life over the last what 14 years now since I let go over 110 pounds You know back when when I had an extra 110 pounds on me. I didn't exercise I hated sweat, I hated to move it, hurt, I didn't like it. I didn't exercise. But thanks to hypnosis, healthy eating, exercise, I was able to take the weight off. And exercise has become a very important part of my life. I feel better as a result of exercise. I think better. I have more energy. I sleep better. I just stall around and have much healthier. And my immune system is better. I don't get sick. one of the things that I really truly enjoy doing is exercising. And you know, I'm kind of a gym rat. I'm in the gym five days a week. And a lot of that is it's a social time for me. There's this group of people that I've come to know and love over the last 12, 13 years of going to this particular gym and we're all in there by 5 a.m. and we do things together and we go for bike rides and a friend from the gym, he and I are going bike or mountain climbing a couple weeks and I love to get out every opportunity I have to get out on the road on my bike and go for 20, 30, 50 mile bike rides, even century rides. And exercise has just become a very important part of my life. And anyway, I was talking with these clients about reasons to exercise and motivations for exercise. I was reminded of a couple studies that I read in MD, one from WebMD. One was from last week and one was actually from this morning. The first one is dated May 28th of 2010. vigorous physical activity reduced one of the key signs of cellular aging, telomere shortening. Now telomeres are tiny strips of genetic material that look like tails in the ends of our cells. Telomere shortening is a known indicator of aging in cells. And in this particular study, the women who engaged in brief vigorous physical activity, at least 40 minutes over the three day period, and were stressed, had longer telomeres than their inactive, stressed-out counterparts. The authors conclude that 13 minutes or more of vigorous exercise daily appears to be the critical amount correlated with longer telomeres. Physical activity is so good for you and stress is bad for you, but the new study shows the stress-buffering effects of physical activity in those who are chronically stressed. The CDC Center for Disease Control recommendations are 75 minutes of vigorous activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity plus weight-bearing exercise every week for adults that that would be enough. Now the other study that I read today says that fit people burn fat faster. And it says people who are more fit are able to mobilize the fuel source in fat better than those who are less fit. Opposite findings come from studies of sedentary people. Metabolic profiles indicates that sedentary The ordinary people's bodies get better and better at storing up fat reserves. Sure, they don't want that. With exercise, you tap into all these fuels in the body and put yourself in fuel burning mode. Unfortunately, the balance in a lot of people is tipped toward over storage mode and away from the marked metabolic response seen even in a short bout of exercise. So here we are, 65% of the people. overweight and from the studies that I've read from what I've observed is most of these people aren't exercising, they aren't moving their body. And what they're doing then by not exercising, one is they're increasing their body's ability to store fat and also they're increasing aging. When you get out and move, you improve your overall immune system, you can decrease stress, you can slow down the aging process, and by moving you speed up fat burning. Now again the question is how do I get motivated? How do I get myself up off my butt and go for that walk or go pump the iron in the weight machine in the basement or out there in the garage or how do I get on my bike or show up at the gym or go first one, whatever it might be for you. How do I get up and do that? And that's where from my perspective hypnosis comes in.

I'm Roger Moore. You know folks if you follow any of my videos my blog posts, you know that one of the things I talk a lot about is the importance of exercise and had a couple conversations with clients this morning about motivation desire to get out and exercise and And you know there's been a big change in my life over the last what 14 years now since I let go over 110 pounds You know back when when I had an extra 110 pounds on me. I didn't exercise I hated sweat, I hated to move it, hurt, I didn't like it. I didn't exercise. But thanks to hypnosis, healthy eating, exercise, I was able to take the weight off. And exercise has become a very important part of my life. I feel better as a result of exercise. I think better. I have more energy. I sleep better. I just stall around and have much healthier. And my immune system is better. I don't get sick. one of the things that I really truly enjoy doing is exercising. And you know, I'm kind of a gym rat. I'm in the gym five days a week. And a lot of that is it's a social time for me. There's this group of people that I've come to know and love over the last 12, 13 years of going to this particular gym and we're all in there by 5 a.m. and we do things together and we go for bike rides and a friend from the gym, he and I are going bike or mountain climbing a couple weeks and I love to get out every opportunity I have to get out on the road on my bike and go for 20, 30, 50 mile bike rides, even century rides. And exercise has just become a very important part of my life. And anyway, I was talking with these clients about reasons to exercise and motivations for exercise. I was reminded of a couple studies that I read in MD, one from WebMD. One was from last week and one was actually from this morning. The first one is dated May 28th of 2010. vigorous physical activity reduced one of the key signs of cellular aging, telomere shortening. Now telomeres are tiny strips of genetic material that look like tails in the ends of our cells. Telomere shortening is a known indicator of aging in cells. And in this particular study, the women who engaged in brief vigorous physical activity, at least 40 minutes over the three day period, and were stressed, had longer telomeres than their inactive, stressed-out counterparts. The authors conclude that 13 minutes or more of vigorous exercise daily appears to be the critical amount correlated with longer telomeres. Physical activity is so good for you and stress is bad for you, but the new study shows the stress-buffering effects of physical activity in those who are chronically stressed. The CDC Center for Disease Control recommendations are 75 minutes of vigorous activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity plus weight-bearing exercise every week for adults that that would be enough. Now the other study that I read today says that fit people burn fat faster. And it says people who are more fit are able to mobilize the fuel source in fat better than those who are less fit. Opposite findings come from studies of sedentary people. Metabolic profiles indicates that sedentary The ordinary people's bodies get better and better at storing up fat reserves. Sure, they don't want that. With exercise, you tap into all these fuels in the body and put yourself in fuel burning mode. Unfortunately, the balance in a lot of people is tipped toward over storage mode and away from the marked metabolic response seen even in a short bout of exercise. So here we are, 65% of the people. overweight and from the studies that I've read from what I've observed is most of these people aren't exercising, they aren't moving their body. And what they're doing then by not exercising, one is they're increasing their body's ability to store fat and also they're increasing aging. When you get out and move, you improve your overall immune system, you can decrease stress, you can slow down the aging process, and by moving you speed up fat burning. Now again the question is how do I get motivated? How do I get myself up off my butt and go for that walk or go pump the iron in the weight machine in the basement or out there in the garage or how do I get on my bike or show up at the gym or go first one, whatever it might be for you. How do I get up and do that? And that's where from my perspective hypnosis comes in. Because with hypnosis instead of being in that old trance of oh I'm too tired or I don't want to or I'm too embarrassed to go to the gym or I don't like to sweat or I just don't have the motivation. All very powerful hypnotic suggestions that people give themselves. With hypnosis you give yourself a new hypnotic suggestion. It's like putting in a new CD or a new MP3 and listening to new words to a new song that I'm motivated.

Me parece que hay un tema ahí, que da como una luz que no me gusta. Estamos con ciertos problemas, con el croma, con el render, con el tender, no tenemos mucho tiempo. Lo que sigamos a hablar brevemente es sobre aquella teoría que dice que el artista habla solamente de dos o tres obsesiones que tiene. Es decir, dos o tres temas a los cuales recurre habitualmente. Si hablamos del rock, la cerveza y la policía, estos son tres temas habituales si hablamos por supuesto de un determinado subgénero del rock hoy nos vamos a referir a una banda que habla de uno de esos temas para desarrollar su incipiente carrera trata de no romperlo porque después hay que pagarlo todo. Esta es la historia de un grupo patrocinado por el conocido manager Spencer Clay que desafía la autoridad policial y los marrones una banda que ha hecho de su conflicto con la policía una carrera y un estilo musical El gran problema que tienen los marrones es que el único incidente que tuvieron con la policía fue cuando Marqui Marrone robó de un supermercado una botella de cerveza y lo detuvieron cuando fue a devolver el envase. Estuvo cuatro minutos y medio en la comisaría y lo dejaron libre diciéndole que por ser la primera vez pasaba. Los barrones buscan entonces tener problemas con la policía para poder alimentarse de la furia anti policial necesaria para seguir con su carrera. No hemos tenido muchos problemas, la verdad, pero estamos intentando encontrar ese límite a través de la provocación. A ver si nos detienen o algo, mamita cariño. Todo el tiempo lo intentan. ¿Cómo se va el viento para el otro lado? ¿Se está yendo el viento para el otro lado? Oye, ¿y se va? Venga, pero policía. Pero frente al fracaso los marrones no se rinden. Qué bien que lo armaste, nano. Ahora con esto vas a tener que venir y sí o sí vas a tener que volerlo, sí o sí. Con esto. Prendenmelo, prendenmelo, dale. Vale, prendenmelo. Sí, sí. Ay, prendió. Ay, viene. Ay, viene la ley. Estamos fumando marihuana, mamita, camina. ¿Perdones para consumo personal? Sí, claro, para consumo personal. ¿Qué malo? los marrones una banda que algún día logrará tener problemas con la policía si, hola señor policía, le estoy viéndote a la comisaría como estamos grandes? eh, chatas queridos, me dijo que estamos grandes chatas, iguales las sodas los marrones siguen intentando","Yes, you know what's missing? I think there's a theme there that gives me a light I don't like. We're having some problems with the chroma, with the render, with the tender, we don't have much time. What we're going to talk about briefly is about that theory that says that the artist only talks about two or three obsessions he has. That is, two or three topics that he usually recurs. If we talk about rock, beer and the police, these are three topics usual themes if we talk about a certain subgenre of the road today we are going to refer to a band that talks about one of those themes to develop its incipient career try not to break it because then you have to pay it all this is the story of a group sponsored by the known manager Spencer clay who challenges the police authority The browns, a band that has made a conflict with the police, a career and a musical style. The big problem with the brownies is that the only incident that they had with the police was when Marquis Marrone stole a supermarket from a bottle and stopped him when he was going to return to the embassy. He was four and a half minutes in the police station and they left him free, saying that for being the first time he passed. The barons then seek to have problems with the police to be able to feed on the anti-police fury necessary to continue with their career. We've had no problems, but we're trying to find that limit and go through the provocation. Let's see if they stop us. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something.

Life is the sun that shines, the rain that falls. The reaction that runs, the sound that sings. A word that is whispered in the sphere, the compliment that makes us happy. So let's live life and make it a party. Yesterday has already passed, tomorrow will turn. So let's live today with joy, with love, with faith. The difficulty we thought of... I was told that I was going to be a believer. I didn't conform. I told you that I didn't conform.

To be a father and all my children are pastors. Mrs. Teresa, having children in the barbed wire, playing, smoking, smoking, everyone has. Son preaching the word of God, they are little. Then I will give all the support of the Son of the Lord. The Father who conformed me. I give all the support. And that's why I abandoned us. I was just going to leave our church, but it will be of all support. And today, when I see my son pray, the best thing I think in the world is to take God and people to God. Our Lord. I also want to say that I am also ... Now Teresinha, Teresinha is the Spirit. You see, here in the house there is a Catholic, there is an evangelical, there is a Spirit. Teresinha is the Spirit and she is a high school girl. She used to do the meeting, like this, sitting on the table, there in the Beirá, And she is a psychologist as well as a spirit. So I respect the religion of everyone, everyone has their own. But how was it to accept her case more difficult than the Gospel? Well, she explains so much to us, she explains everything about what is what is not. So I accept. She also does the works that she knows that we... She also does charity, the spiritist also does charity. I have a lot of pride in my children. We are poor, but they are all thanks to God. I'm not a thief in my family, I don't have a wife, thanks to God my children, my grandchildren, for now, I feel very proud of them."

First up, a change in scheduling plans. We will not be competing in the Buffalo Wildlands Blazing Challenge today. Instead, we'll be competing on Thursday. So tune in on Friday morning to see how it all goes down and if we can finish the challenge or not. Okay, so I want to talk about today the Golden Globes. and the dresses that came out of the Golden Globes. I love fashion, so I gotta tell you about some of my favorite dresses and some of my picks for the best and the worst dress of 2009 Golden Globes. First up, my favorite dress by far was Eva Longorius. It was a ream aqua ground and it was bright red and perfect. It reminded me of like the perfect Barbie silhouette. So that one is my absolute favorite dress, one that I would love to have and wear and buy, but it was perfect. So that's number one. number one on the worst dress list. Renee Delweiger, I love you, but that dress was a little bit of a mistake. I think it just took your eyes to all the wrong places and just, it fit her kind of strangely. So that one has to be one of my worst picks. Next up on the best dress list, Kate Winslet. She actually did really good at the awards and won two gold aglobes and her dress was perfectly simple. It was black and it had a nice bow on the side of it. It was done by Yevon St. Lauren and it was perfect. It reflected her style and her personality. So that was really classy and really great. And then finally one of my favorite ones was Anne Hathaway. She was actually in an Armani Privet gown and a lot of people didn't like it. They thought it was too dark or too sparkly but I thought it was perfect. It really embodied her sense of style and her personality. So that was one of my favorite ones. for this morning. Tune in tomorrow when we'll talk a little bit about the new movie, The Watchers.","Hey everybody and welcome to today's crew in 2, your source for everything that's going on in Hollywood, on the CW and right here in Wichita all in under 2 minutes.

Assemblée nationale, 22 mars 2011","Crédits, MArc Picard, Québec, politique, Assemblée nationale, Finances",29,0,0,/content/drive/MyDrive/test/EGBI222_merged/xtT1-C1TcpE.mp3,"Ok, allez-y, Monsieur le député des Chis de la Chaudière. j'ai obtenu des citoyens qui disaient on pensait pas qu'on était rendus là. Puis là les gens, mais quand j'ai dit que c'est positif, c'est qu'après coup, je pense qu'on pourra tous prendre ensemble des mesures qui vont peut-être être difficiles, mais les prendre avec les citoyens. Donc c'est très constructif mes propos. Et je vous remercie, mais dans la présidente. Ça a pas dit très long. J'aimerais avoir des explications concernant les orientations du ministère. Si on prend un pourcentage des ressources budgétaires pour soutenir le développement du secteur financier, tout en assurant la protection des épargnants, il y a 9,6% de plus positif comme travail lorsque la dette ne cesse de croître, avec, lorsqu'on voit que 37 % des effectifs du ministère qui est une partie de leur travail, c'est ça. Alors, Monsieur le ministre. Oui, je suis assuré parce qu'on n'est pas assez du volume, des 800 pages du budget au volume des crédits, mais dans le présent, puis peut-être que le ministre pourrait donner une explication, la technique, c'est pour répondre aux députés. Alors, j'ai le sentiment que ce soit le ministre qui répond, Je vais le consentement. C'est le sous-ministre qui répond. Allez-y, Monsieur le sous-ministre. Identifiez-vous s'il vous plaît. Il y a des programmes d'empreinte qui sont en cours d'année. On ne peut pas faire ça. Ça prend plusieurs opérations de financement dans une année, pratiquement une ou deux semaines pour réaliser les programmes d'empreinte. On cherche à minimiser le coût d'intérêt. À l'intérieur de ces 37 % vous avez ces effectifs qui sont comptabilisés. Comme les effectifs qui travaillent à l'analyse par exemple des taux de change qui ont un lien avec le coût de la dette du gouvernement. qui est un objectif quatre fois supérieur, qui est en interactif avec 10 gouvernements provinciaux, deux gouvernements de territoire, 34 000 citoyens, 34 millions d'habitants, et dispose de 763 fonctionnaires. Comment on peut justifier, peut-être que je ne comprends pas tous les mandats non plus, mais comment on peut justifier pour le Canada, il y a 700, 700, et au Québec, nous a 697. de déplacement. Mais pour répondre à votre vocation, il faudrait que j'aie une compréhension un peu plus fine de comparaison. On aura peut-être l'occasion, lors de nos 10 heures de débat, ce que fait exact... Il y a des missions qui se font au ministère des Finances Québec qui ne doivent pas se faire au ministère des Finances du Canada. Entre autres, je pense que le contrôleur des finances. Nous, toute la comptabilité gouvernementale, il y a le contrôleur des finances. Ça, c'est au ministère des Finances du Québec. Je suis pas sûr que c'est au ministère des Finances et au Réservoir général du Canada. C'est une section importante parce que c'est tout particulièrement stanné. La consolidation qui plaît tant au député de Schaeffer, qui plaît aussi, c'est lui, le vérificateur général, 60 000 heures de travail qui ont été faits de cette année par l'ensemble de l'eau comptable. Voilà une mission différente entre autres. Merci, Monsieur le ministre. Il reste, je pense, 30 secondes pour Monsieur le député de Schaeffer. Au niveau de l'augmentation des cotisations à l'érigidérat, Je vais dire une cédule sur six ans, mais vous dire que dans trois ans, vous revisez le taux. Donc est-ce que je dois comprendre que vous avez décidé de prendre une cédule de six ans parce qu'il va y avoir une élection entre temps, tout simplement, ou parce que je ne comprends pas. Je me semble que ça a été si simple de dire tout de suite, on va atteindre le 10.8 en trois ans, puis dans trois ans, on va regarder qu'est-ce que ça prend, est-ce qu'on diminue, est-ce qu'on augmente ou qu'on reste temps? Donc, j'aimerais juste vous entendre. Je ne sais pas si vous vous entendez plus. Je ne sais pas si vous vous entendez plus. Je ne sais pas si vous vous entendez plus.

So it's very constructive my proposal. And I want to thank you, but in the President. It's not very long. I would like to have explanations about the administration's guidelines. If we take a percentage of budget resources to support the development of the financial sector, while ensuring the protection of the e-parniers, there is 9.6% The government is working on the reduction of the debt. So, Mr. the Minister? Yes, I'm just reassured because we have passed the 800 pages of the budget to the volume of credits. In my opinion, perhaps the Minister could give an explanation, the technique is to respond to the deputies. So I have the feeling that it is the Minister who responds? I have consent. It is the minister who responds. Go ahead, Mr. Minister. Identify yourself, please. I have the floor. I am the minister. In fact, the officials who work on reducing debt, there are all the teams who are there for the management of the debt of Quebec, who proceed with the initiatives, who work to obtain the best possible conditions for the Quebec to determine the most important moments for employment. We can't do that. It takes several financial operations in one year, almost one or two weeks, to implement the unemployment programs. What we're trying to do is to minimize the cost of interest. So within these 37% you have these effects that are contrabasized, as well as the effects that work in the analysis, for example, of the tax changes, those things that have a link with the cost of the debt of the government. It's not budget that is being spent on me, that is being spent on the human being for the people of Quebec, to a better world, even if the Minister is not often on the word of a better world. I made a comparison and I would like to have your understanding of things, Mr. Minister. When the Finance Ministry is 697 Tessu, it has full employment, if we compare with the Finance Ministry in Ottawa, which is a four-time superior object, which is in interaction with 10 provincial governments, two government governments of the territory, 34,000 citizens, 34 million inhabitants, and has a functionary 760% rate. How can we justify – maybe I don't understand all the words either – but how can we justify that for Canada, there are 700 – 700 Thank you for the question. But to answer your question, I would have to make a comparison a little more precise. We may have the opportunity during our 10-hour debate to see what exactly is happening. There are missions that are done by the Ministry of Finance in Quebec that must not be done by the Ministry of Finance in Canada. Among other things, I think that the Ministry of Finance, all of our environmental accountability, is the Ministry of Finance in Quebec. I am not sure it is the Ministry of Finance and the General Reserve of Canada. This is an important section, especially this year. The consolidation that the Deputy Chiefs and the general public health care workers have done, 60,000 hours of work that were done this year together with our partners. That's one different mission. Thank you, Mr. Minister. The Deputy Chiefs, I think 30 seconds left. For Mr. Deputy Chiefs. I have established a six-year-old sedulce, but you say that in three years you will review the rate. So what do I have to understand that you have decided to take a six-year-old sedulce because there will be an election in between? Or simply because I don't understand. I think it's so simple to say right away that we will reach 10.8 in three years. And in three years, we will see what it takes. Will we decrease, will we increase or will we stay? I was surprised. We are in the economic recovery that is well-attended, we are back on the budget. You notice that most of the measures of this budget, whether it be the favorable ones, such as the guardries, in a sense, where the ones that impose a burden, are spread over a period of five years, a question of dosing as much as possible on the citizens and on the government. Thank you."

I'm not sure where these are from. I have I've had these for a little while so I can't really tell you where I've got them I got them at but if you can find anything like that or anything close you probably use like a eyeliner or Anything that's sparkly Then you want to just put it on top of the blue and you probably put it a little bit into your crease too I'm going to put it down the bottom because again we're Disney princesses and we love our glitter and our sparkles So after you got that on I'm just gonna hurry up and I'll stiff so I'm gonna take my mascara and I'm going to do my bottom lashes I'm trying to figure out how to keep my videos interesting guys because I know I don't talk that much So I'm trying to do something to make it a little bit better for for you guys. the light blue color.

They were called Actors Hotels back then, and I was a daily visitor. I came to see Paul Dreylin, aristocrat of deception. Paul was a professional magician, and I was his student. I'd call from the lobby and wait anxiously for the elevator operator to take me up. Each floor had a unique tray. Actors on one floor, dancers on another, and divas seemed to be everywhere. On each visit, Paul would greet me at the door of the same salutation. Come in, my boy, followed by, well, what you got to show me today. Paul was fifty-something, small to medium build, slipped down hair, soft spoken, and had a pasty white complexion that covered the fragile features of his face. His room was pretty basic. He had a walk-in closet where he stored props and clothing and a small bathroom adjacent to it. The windowsill doubled as a refrigerator and off to the side was a hot plate that could accommodate small offerings. Lighting was minimal, a ceiling bulb and a night lamp off to the side of his bed. It was here in this room that I learned card manipulation, sleight of hand, not card tricks. This was the fine art of magic. We'd worked four and five hours at a clip. Most of it, I may add, consisted of me picking up cards from the floor that I was always dropping. It amazes me to this day what could be done with 52 pieces of cardboard with ink printed on them. When placed in the hands of a skilled sleight of hand artist, a fan of cards could become a mobile sculpture, not separate from the hand, but part of it, gliding through time and space and creating and and walk up to Times Square. The night air always felt heavy and I could still smell the stale smoke of grilled sausages, franks and burgers. I proceed down the steps of the IRT train and prepare myself for the long journey home. Needless to say, the Ashley was a dive and Paul and all of its residents were leftovers from vaudeville and the nightclub circuit, an era that had seen its better days. Paul used to say that the boat sailed, but to me he was no stranded passenger. He was still an aristocrat. not of deception, but perception. He was a man who had seen what I wanted to see, had been to places I wanted to visit, had lived at a time I wish I'd been part of. When I look back at all of this, I realize that it was the most memorable time of my life and also the happiest.","It was 30 years ago, the Ashley Hotel, one of the smaller places tucked in east of Broadway.

P nos va a dar el valor de la variación del número. Si es P es igual a 1, el número está correcto y sale del ciclo, sino sigue repitiendo hasta que esté en el ciclo correcto.

First we need libraries, the most important of all. Then the body. This will help us to see if we want to run the process again. Here is what the program is going to be or some small instructions. Always put a pause so that it does not get erased or we erase it. Then we go with the second part, which is important, where the matrix is going to go and the arrangements. Within these two forces the matrix will have numbers from 1 to 21 here begins a small validation in which the number will be transmitted that goes between a range of 1 to 3 that is why we need a message since we are going to give two options the first if is that it is only number and the second that will be that tells us where the range of what number to what number is then we are going to need to validate numbers In this we will identify if the numbers are between 1 and 9 but as we will only use the option of a single number and the range will be 1 of 3, then in this case P will give us the value of the variation of the number if P is equal to 1 the number is correct and it comes out of the cycle if not continue repeating until it is in the correct cycle In this we will save the matrix inside a rule. We will need a rule for the matrix to reorder the numbers. Once the process is reordered, it repeats and repeats. We simplify it. Once three processes are made, we will need to show the result of the matrix and the number that has been chosen or that has been guessed. Once done, we run it. We wait for the program to compile, to take a little while because it is a lot of information. Ready, we have the program left. The program to divide a number. Instructions, only choose the column, the number that has already been selected. Note, you should not forget at any time the selected number, a entity. From here we will choose a random number. We choose 17, it is in column 2. PAX reordered everything and the other Now we have to reorder the column 3 and press 2 to show the result Press N to exit the program and that's it guys"

Klima se menja, iznenadženja su velika, svaki čas doživljavamo promene, recimo pre desetak dana temperatura je bila 38, onda je pala na plus 4, znači 34 stepene pa to je zaista onako jedno šamaranje ljudi i opomena čoveće promenima Promeni se malo, promeni nešto prema prirodi, promeni prema čovek u svom nešto, ali ako to ne budeš učinio, vrlo brzo, eto, klimace naš Shamara ti. Znači, toplo hladno. Nije slučeno da to postoji u psihologiji. Znači, kada nešto učinimo, posledice su vrlo često u vidu Shamara i eto, promena znači da treba možda da budemo spremni. Da već sada jesmo na neki način opomenu da ovo nije baš tako bezopasno doba. Promena znači da više obratimo pažnju na Kosmos, na reke, na planine, na male mrave, na algje koje su doskora sprećavale oluje ispred New Jersey'a, a sada New Orleans, New Jersey često budu potopljeni ima žrtava, zato što više nema algi nobaloj koje su čuvale klimu koja je bila smirena. Ja mislim da kada ljudima pričam da nesim Kada im pričam da su šume desetkova, njudi su dosta mrtvi hladni. Ali čini mi se da na klimu sada već svi pomalo reagujem. Svi pitaju šta je to? Šta se to dešava? Kako je su to promene koje ne može više čovek lako da izdraži? Ja mislim da postoje dve vrste promena. Jedna je promena u vidu metarmofoza, u vidu preobraže kada mi sami kreiramo promene, a druga je u vidu eto tihih kremov. neki posledičnih kažnjavanja koja dođu same u vidu i okviru naše ponašanja. U kineskoj filosofiji postoji kraj Maimuna kao što postoji Promete i u Grčkoj našoj evropskoj kulturi. Promete je doneo vatru, a kraj Maimuna je doneo kulturet, to je promena. Ja je sam za promene, ja je sam čove koji prati mene, znači, ali isto tako u pozoravam da promene u ovom trenutku, kada mi više nemo 4 godješnje doba, kada samo živimo sa 2 godješnje doba. I mi smo danas upravo u Jeseni, a Jeseni gotovo i nema. Iz klime u automobilu koja bila, recimo, na toplim, na vrelim, u onim danima kada je vruće, kada pustimo na 12-17-16, mi sada od jednom prebacujemo klima na toplota, jer nema više ono perioda kada treba umereno da živimo. Ivo ja sam upravo sada napravio jednu malu promenu. Nisam više pored betona, nisam pored metala, nisam pored stakleni iz grada. Nalazim se pored jedne tezge, da su materijali od drvena. Oni su napravljeni nešto mašinski, nešto ručno, ali drvo nam kaže da može još život da bude topao. Možda još imamo vremena da u ovakvo izdeli, sačuvamo smisa o života, da u ovakvo i u nekim elementima koji su napravljeni oklagija, naravno ne treba da žena bije muža kada dođe, može nekad malo i da popijel tego oskodžav, a ne treba da pretera, ali da u vakvim elementima ponovopronadžemo bliskos, toplinu, pažljivos jer drveni predmeti još govore da savremenos može da se spasne. Menjajmo se u tom smislu na drugačiji način, menjajmo se prema plemenitosti. Prenjajmo se prema odnosu naše celine, prema ambijentu, prema našim životnim zanjima, a to su živa bića. Zbog toga čini mi se nekako, prenego što se možda i dešti neka kataklizmo koje sad da svih ovori, a to su ekološke katastrofe, čovet bi mogo da se probudi, mogo bi sam sebe da malo i šamara, da nas ne bi šamarala klima i da promena ne bude ovakvo karaktera, kakvo je sad da Primećajemo, ne promena od minus 4 na plus 28, od plus 38 na plus 4, nego promena koja će u nama izazvati mnogo više ljudskog učoveku i mnogo više čovečnog u ljudima.","Change, change, change. Today, when the word change is said, it seems to me that no one thinks of changing the village, the city, the city, that no one thinks of changing the girl, changing the parks or streets that are traditional to me. But when we say change, I think that everyone has the first association on climate change. That is today's current topic, that is something that most ordinary people recognize. The climate is changing, the conditions are great, we are experiencing changes every hour. Before the 10th day, the temperature was 38 degrees, then it was on a plus 4, so 34 degrees, so it really is a shame to people and the memory of a man will change It's not something for me, it's something for me, for me, for a man, but if you don't do that, the climate of our shamaras is very fast. It's not a coincidence that there are psychologists. When we do something, the consequences are very often in the form of shamaras. And here's the change. It means that we need to be prepared. that this is not so safe. Change means that we pay more attention to the space, to the rivers, to the mountains, to small rivers, to algae that have almost crossed the bay in front of New Jersey. And now New Orleans, New Jersey, there will often be heated and there will be victims, because there are no longer algae in the area that have preserved the climate that was calm. I think that when people talk about There are many water on the planet. When I talk to them, there are dozens of them. People are quite cold. But it seems to me that on the climate, now everyone reacts a little. Everyone asks, what is that? What is happening? What are those changes that cannot be easily detected by more people? Here, I think there are two types of changes. One is the change in the form of a thermophosphate, in the form of a pre-shape, when we create changes ourselves. And the other is in the form of those and some subsequent statements that come into view by our behavior. In the Chinese philosophy, there is the king of the Maymun, as it is in Greece and our European culture, the king of the fire has brought the fire, and the king of the Maymun has brought the cultural river, which is a change. I am for change, I am a person who follows me, but I also pay attention to change in this moment, when we don't have 4 years of good, when we only live with 2 years of good. And we are today in autumn, and in autumn there is no more. From the climate in the car, which was, let's say, on the warm, on the hot, in those days, when it's hot, when we go to 12, 16, we now put the climate on the heat from one to the other, because there is no more period when we have to live peacefully. I made a small change. I'm no longer near concrete, metal, or glass buildings. I'm near a mill where the materials are made of wood. They are made by hand, but wood can heat up life. Maybe we still have time to separate, preserve the meaning of life, In these elements, which are made of clay, of course, women should never drink, women should never sweat. But in these elements, we find closeness, warmth, care, because of the wooden objects. And it says that time can be saved. Let's change our mind in a different way. Let's change our mind towards the tribe. We change our whole attitude towards the ambience, our life experiences, and that is the living being. Because of that, we are making ourselves, before we can even go through a cataclysm, which everyone is talking about, there are ecological disasters. A person could wake up, he could himself, and a little bit of a shamara, so that the climate would not be a shamara, and to change, there would be no such character as what is now We will notice that there is no change from minus 4 to plus 28, from plus 38 to plus 4, but a change that will lead us to a much more human person and much more human people."

Today I'd like to show you how easy it is to bring a geospatial aspect to your business data and your business applications. Esri has provided a free widget based on the iWidget 2.0 specification for adding interactive professional quality maps to your enterprise applications and for mashing up with other business applications. This widget is called the MapWidget for ArcGIS. It's ready to deploy out of the box, ready to use, entirely configured. No programming is needed to add mapping to your business applications. So here's an example. I have a call center application with data coming in. I can see my calls for service coming in at the data table. And there are two map widgets. As the user, you can simply click on one of the calls and the map responds by zooming in to that point that I select. Let's take a look at how this was put together. First, you need to add You can download it for free from the IBM Lotus and WebSphere Portal Business Solutions Catalog. Here's the catalog. Here's the Map Widget for ArcGIS Entry. Simply download it from this site, which I've done already, and now you'll have it as a simple war file. Once you've obtained the war file, you can upload it into your local catalog in your IBM Mashup Center. Upload, upload widget, and simply browse for it on your website. This will add it to your catalog and you can begin to use it. Now once you've added it to your local catalog and then added it to your mashup builder, you can show it up and you can then begin to drag and assemble your application. You can add the map widget simply by dragging it onto the canvas. Next we'll bring in our call center data. So what you'd want to do is for every time you select a record in your call center data table, you want the map to zoom to the location where that image is. That call was for. So here you can begin to wire up your widgets. When you as a user select a row in the table, you want your map to zoom to the location of that record based on the address. Now you've wired it up and immediately you're ready to go. Select a record and your maps work. So in summary we can see that using the map widget for ArcGIS can bring a new geographic context. view of your data that can help you transform it into meaningful information, displayed on informative maps while providing access to online data, and base map services from Esri. The Map Widget adheres to IVM's iWidget specification, and it includes an optimized compiled widget ready for deployment, along with the source code for extensibility, but also user documentation and license text. With the Map Widget for ArcGIS, it's extremely easy to embed high quality mapping into your business analytics.","Hello.

But if you look at the business, guys, the business is hot. Guys, truth is, you have a lot of customers. You buy your own cell phone, your rate, your air conditioner, if you buy a new one, you'll be able to buy it. My God, I'm having a hard time. You'll be able to eat it and load it.

If you see that it's 6,000 a day, and the good thing is that if you have a product that you're still selling, you'll have a business like this. In this case, I'll tell you that this is the new business in the lives of many Filipinos. I don't have any words that I'm not disciplined in this business. I'm not durable. There's no excuse to make the Filipinos suffer. Because there's a way to see this. It's up to you to choose. There's no way. There's no direct selling. If you can't sell, If you choose to sell, you will win. For example, 1,000 pesos customer price. 70% less. How much is the customer? 300. If you are still in the customer, you will see double in the price. In our time, 25 pesos first, you will get 60, 70, 90. If you play, you will be happy again.

You won't be able to go back. There's no evidence here. Is it good that you're not going to stop? The two ways of seeing. That's what I said to you earlier.

Here you will know if it's for you or not for your business. Ask! Do you have a company that doesn't know two people? So, is there a person who doesn't know two people? I believe that if we don't know two people, maybe you're not a person. The only thing that we don't know is two people. Of course, the more, If you have a product package, you will have 1,000 pesos in your sales package. If you have a sales package in your product package, you will have 2,000,000 in your sales commission. What do you see in the group sales commission?

Among other things, all the laws that the law enforcement officers had to carry out, such as the law of fire protection with plans, evacuation, graphic instructions, the way of removing these evacuations, people from the area that are surrounded by fire extinguishers. What does it do when the fire comes? Usually in this situation, someone thinks that not everyone is in debt to participate in the evacuation of people, but again, the most unforgivable law says that every citizen is in debt to fire if it can be done by himself, without danger on himself or on another person. If not in the state to fire yourself, the debt is to put it in fire, fire extinguishers, 9.3, bravo, here is the man, 93, Mada Seliciti, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 92, the state service of the internal affairs, 93, the fire brigade, 94, the fire and medical aid, with the difference, that the fire and medical aid often comes and collaborates, and in the most remote parts of the city, in Trugas, the fire and medical brigade of Belgrade, The fire is set for 15-20 minutes under the conditions of the correct fire statement. What does the correct fire statement mean? The correct fire statement means that when the famous number is changed, which number is it? 93. That is now cemented, please bring it to others, because we don't know how the ball will play on every fire. The fire can happen to absolutely everyone. Here is the gentleman who is talking right now, he is saying that something is wrong with him, he probably felt it from our story, but I will tell you immediately that I also took this thought out of the Belgrade Electro-Technical Faculty, where I gave the team of two professors of the Electro-Technical Faculty, to be transferred to one professor and said, Mr. Čupic, I think that's a little demagogy, that you are talking about a smart man who knows the termotaph, We know that in the energy process, something like that cannot happen. I see a wolf on your left side, and you are cat-ing with it. Don't do that, because if I bring you the data that the matrix of the station in Ohio was burned in one of the American countries, where people are in huge economic situation, in defense of the private capital, and how it will be put into practice, They are not afraid of protection, especially in the West. What else can we talk about? Some of them are a bit afraid of other professors. But three days later, I call Mr. Bora Alimpic, deputy commander of the Vatruvovac Spasilaške Brigade of the Belgrade City, and asks, the chief says, you are the head of the electronic faculty, he said yes, three days ago, he says, now they have a fire. Please, all of you, try to bring people closer to the matter, to somehow know how to behave preventively and operatively, In that time, Mr. Kovacic, the current director of the Belgrade University, was at the faculty. I called him and said, what happened? He said, you will not believe. The same professor who said that a smart person cannot make a fire, forgot, turned on his laboratory and called for a fire. It would be like a anecdote that six months later, the same person in Borči did not explode the TV, called for a fire in the house, and one of the houses was not in the house, the whole house burned out. Now the Belgrade University has bought a means to have a person over the head. I'm telling you, the real data is clear, to illustrate the situation, to burn something that can happen absolutely to everyone. However, our people usually come out of the fact that the unpleasant situations are something that happens to others, but not to them. Unfortunately, it can happen to everyone. We started the phone number with the help of the emergency system. Thank you for number 112."

Judy and Santos has reached the top of the list of the most popular calls in her show. Last week, the news about the entertainment websites was revealed that Regina and Juday are both pregnant. The songbird already denied the rumor. But the telesery queen has been all mom since the issue was released. I always say that Jodai also reacts to many comments that he's been booming lately because of his pregnancy. I'm beautiful, right? I'm not even a reason. I don't have any feelings for him. I don't have any more to check up. I don't have any more to do. I feel bad for him. But I don't have any more to do. They will update their part back. Let's see if it's a good idea to go there. The question is, will Juday go to the showbiz if he is going to go to the showbiz? It really depends on what I will be looking like after I finish. I can say that I want to go back asap. If I don't want to go back, I think it's a bit too much. Next up is the hot air of Hunky. We have ex-housemate Paul Jicks. and photo with the girl who is alive when Eli returns!"
